    In this talk I will describe four types of spatial epidemiological
    study that may be summarized as: disease mapping; clustering and
    cluster detection; point/line source studies; ecological
    studies. A basic aim is to quantify and isolate sources of
    variability in disease rates; the latter often to gain clues to
    disease aetiology. I have been involved in a number of studies
    carried out by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit in the United
    Kingdom; an independent government-sponsored unit part of whose
    remit is to investigate, using routinely-collected data, the link
    between putative sources of environmental pollution and disease
    risk.

    In studies with which I have been involved it has been vital to
    adjust for some measure of socio-economic status since this has
    been shown to be a powerful predictor of a range of health
    outcomes. I will describe the area-level indices utilized, and the
    rationale behind their use, including discussion of the complex
    relationship between health, environmental pollution and
    socio-economic status.

    Demographers and human biologists have long been interested in
    behavioral and biological components of fertility and how those
    components change with age. One of the most difficult issues has
    been the estimation of age-specific fecundability (the monthly or
    cycle-wise probability of conception) and pregnancy loss. These
    two components are confounded by an inability to detect
    pregnancies early in gestation, so that an ovarian cycle in which
    no pregnancy is observed might result from either no conception or
    a conception followed by an unrecognized loss of the pregnancy. We
    developed a parametric model of age-specific pregnancy loss and
    age-specific fecundability, based on the presumed underlying
    biology of pregnancy loss. Pregnancy detection is
    probabilistically determined by the sensitivity and specificity of
    the pregnancy assay. Simulated data were used to examine the
    ability of the model to recover parameters for the entire
    distribution of pregnancy loss. New data were collected in a
    nine-month prospective study conducted in Matlab,
    Bangladesh. About 500 female subjects provided twice-weekly
    interviews and urine samples over 1,561 menstrual cycles. The
    samples were assayed for human chorionic gonadotropin to detect
    early pregnancies. Pregnancies were diagnosed for 329 subjects;
    151 ended in live birth, 93 ended in fetal loss, and 85 were
    right-censored. Total fecundability was estimated to be high and
    constant until age 41, and then declined sharply. The probability
    of pregnancy loss was about 45% per pregnancy at age 18 and rose
    to about 92% by age 38. These results suggest that the apparent
    decline in fecundability through the early 40's results from a
    dramatic increase in early pregnancy losses rather than a true
    change in fecundability.

    Most theoretic models of multiparty electoral competition make the
    assumption that party leaders are motivated to maximize their
    voteshare or seatshare. In plurality rule systems this is a
    sensible assumption. However, in proportional representation
    systems, this assumption is questionable since the ability to make
    public policy is not strictly increasing in voteshares or
    seatshares. I present a theoretic model in which party leaders
    choose electoral declarations with an eye towards the expected
    policy outcome of the coalition bargaining game induced by the
    party declarations and the parties' beliefs about citizens' voting
    behavior. The model is applied to the case of the
    Netherlands. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to estimate the
    parties' beliefs about mass voting behavior. Due to the complexity
    of the parties' objective functions, equilibria are found
    numerically. Unlike previous models of multiparty electoral
    competition, the equilibrium results are consistent with the
    empirical declarations of the 4 major Dutch parties. These results
    make more clear the underlying reasons for the relative scarcity
    of centrist parties in highly proportional electoral systems.

    Qantitative models for social networks were proposed by Frank
    and Strauss (1986) and by Strauss and Ikeda (1990) in the Journal
    of the American Statistical Association. The models were formulated
    in terms of a Markov random field assumption that, at first sight,
    might seem an attractive starting point. The subsequent decade has
    seen a flurry of activity in developing these models, fitting them
    to available data via maximum pseudolikelihood estimation and making
    substantive interpretations of the corresponding parameter values.
    Much of this work, in which S. Wasserman and P. Pattison have been
    key players, has been incorrect or of doubtful value. This talk
    will review the modeling assumptions and statistical methods that
    have been used and develop some more rigorous alternatives in a
    modern computing environment. Some of the many remaining issues
    may also be relevant more widely in quantitative social science.

    Evidence from several countries reveals a substantial drop in
    household consumption around the age of retirement that is difficult to
    explain with standard economic models of life-cycle behavior.  Using food
    consumption data from more than 550 households from the Panel Study of
    Income Dynamics for the years 1979 - 1986 & 1989 - 1992, we find that
    married couple households decrease their expenditures on both food consumed
    at home and away from home by about 8 percent following the retirement of
    the male household head.  This result is robust for several alternative
    definitions of retirement.  No significant decrease in consumption is found
    for single households, either in a sample of males or a pooled sample of
    single males and females.  These results are consistent with a model of
    marital bargaining in which wives prefer to save more than their husbands to
    support an expected longer retirement period, and relative control over
    household decisions is affected by control over market income.'

- abstract: 'The standard model of diffusion is based on communication among
    actors.   But members of an organization also share common goals and
    identify with the collective of the organization.  Thus they are more likely
    to support one another and more likely to exert social pressure on one
    another to adopt an innovation. While these processes have been noted, they
    have not been characterized under a general theoretical framework.  Here we
    describe informal support and social pressure as manifestations of social
    capital, and the diffusion of an innovation within an organization as a
    function of the distribution of social capital in the organization.
    Consideration of social capital links the diffusion process to aspects of
    organizational culture such as sense of community. The theoretical image is
    of a spiraling process of social capital. Through a study of ten elementary
    schools we find evidence consistent with our theoretical links between
    diffusion of innovation and social capital.'

    despite the existence of more powerful tests of the same size. In similar,
    equally simple examples, however, the LR and corresponding ML criteria
    provide inappropriate inferences. It is of interest to identify the
    distinguishing features of these two classes of examples, both of which
    involve only well-behaved statistical models, such as families of univariate
    normal distributions with known variances, and are not artifacts of
    irregularity, contamination, or unboundedness. The second class involves

    In this paper we estimate the effects of children and the
    differential effects of sons and daughters on men's labor supply and hourly
    wage rates. The responses to fatherhood of two cohorts of men from the PSID
    sample- men born in and before 1950 and men born after 1950- are examined
    separately, and we use fixed effects estimation to control for unobserved
    heterogeneity. We find that fatherhood significantly increases the hourly
    wage rates and annual hours of work for men from both cohorts, and that it
    is important to allow for heterogeneity and non-linearity in estimating
    these effects. Most notably, men's labor supply and wage rates increase
    significantly more in response to the births of sons than to the births of
    daughters.

    One question dominates methodological debate in macrosociology: In
    explaining large-scale social processes should we seek simple theories that
    apply under a range of conditions, or complex theories that are tailored to
    specific cases?  Complex explanations are justified by their explanatory
    power and theoretical appeal.  Simple explanations are justified by their
    falsifiability and their capacity to sustain strong conclusions.  I weight
    the merits of simple and complex explanations applying some basic ideas from
    Bayesian statistics.  The Bayesian analysis provides support for a
    compromise position that is rigorously grounded in the fundamental rules of
    probability.  These ideas are illustrated in an analysis of labor union
    growth in Sweden.

    Explaining the decline of fertility in developing countries has
    been one of the main foci of demographic research in the past half-century.
    There are several leading explanations. One is traditional demographic
    transition, or "demand" theory, developed by Kingsley Davis in 1945, and
    presented in perhaps its most refined form by Richard Easterlin in the
    1980s. This says that actual fertility is influenced in specific ways by the
    demand for children, the supply of children, and the costs of fertility
    regulation. These factors are in turn influenced by quantities such as the
    schooling of children and infant mortality. A second leading explanation is
    ideation theory, which identifies modern ideas and their diffusion as the
    key determinant. Of course, all these factors may be important, in which
    case identifying their relative contributions becomes the research task.
    It is hard to adjudicate between these theories, because the relevant
    variables all tend to change together. In a previous study using data from
    Iran in 1950-1977, we were able to make this distinction, and found that the
    fertility decline in Iran was better explained by demand factors than by
    ideational ones.

    The goal in this project is to extend these results to other countries, to
    see if they hold up on a wider scale. To that end, we have already collected
    a data set giving fertility rates and posited determinants for each of 35
    countries that participated in the original World Fertility Survey for 1950
    to 1995. A key part of ideation theory is the idea of diffusion of ideas,
    and this should reflect itself in spatial correlation in our data. We also
    intend to take account explicitly of missing data. We will build a Bayesian
    model for the data that incorporates geostatistical ideas from spatial
    statistics, and multiple imputation ideas for missing data, and estimate it
    using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We will compare the competing
    hypotheses by building statistical models corresponding to each of them, and
    comparing them using Bayes factors.

    Regression and structural equation modeling are two techniques
    commonly employed in social scientific analyses. Both methods produce
    equations (often linear) relating a 'response' to a set of 'explanatory'
    variables.  However, it is well-known that these methods often produce quite
    different equations.  This immediately raises a number of questions,

    I will show that many of these questions may be answered by examining the
    path diagrams associated with structural equation models.

    The talk will describe some of my recent work on this topic, but will also
    draw heavily on the existing literature on causation which has developed in
    diverse fields over the last 50 years, including: Econometrics, Statistics,

    From the inception of the proportional representation movement is
    has been an issue whether larger parties are favored at the expense of
    smaller parties in one apportionment of seats as compared to another
    apportionment.  A number of methods have been proposed and are used in
    countries with a proportional representation system.  These methods exhibit
    the regularity of order that captures the preferential treatment of larger
    versus smaller parties.  This order, namely majorization, permits the
    comparison of seat allocation in two apportionments.  For divisor methods,
    we show that one method is majorized by another method if and only if their
    signpost ratios are increasing.  This criterion is satisfied for the divisor
    methods with power-mean rounding, and the divisor methods with stationary
    rounding.  Majorization places the five traditional apportionment methods in
    the order as they are known to favor larger parties over smaller parties:
    Adams, Dean, Hill, Webster, and Jefferson.

    We consider a parametric version of the two-sided matching model
    described in Roth and Sotomayer (1990). We develop the model for
    the analysis of matching data, where the data consist of pairs of
    individuals, with one individual from each of two distinct
    populations (for example employers and employees, or men and
    women). Individuals agree to form pairs based on utilities they
    have for one another, resulting in a stable set of matches between
    the two populations. We assume these utilities are linear
    combinations of observed characteristics of the individuals, plus
    an error term, and our goal is to estimate the coefficients of
    this linear function. We have found estimation of the parameters
    in such a model to be feasible via Markov chain Monte Carlo
    techniques, and we are beginning to use these techniques for
    simulation studies and data analysis.

    Over the past decade, BIC=L2-df*log(n) has become a popular tool
    for choosing models in social mobility tables and in other
    statistical models in social research. BIC is easy to calculate
    and, unlike standard significance testing, provides consistent
    model selection (i.e. it chooses the correct model with high
    probability when the sample is large). It also closely
    approximates a Bayes factor with a unit information prior on the
    model parameters, i.e. a prior that has about as much information
    as a single typical observation. One consequence of this is that,
    if BIC is used as a hypothesis test, it minimizes the total error
    rate (sum of Type I and Type II errors), on average over data sets
    drawn from the model and the prior. Recently, BIC has been
    criticized because the unit information prior on which it is
    implicitly based can be more spread out than seems reasonable.

    Argue that BIC provides a useful reference analysis because if BIC
    favors the presence of a parameter in the model, there will tend
    to be agreement that it should be there. I then show how more
    precise prior information can be used in calculating Bayes
    factors, via the GLIB software
    (www.research.att.com/~volinsky/bma.html). I compare the
    performance of BIC, GLIB, and standard significance testing by
    simulation, and I also reanalyze the Hazelrigg-Garnier set of
    mobility tables, which motivated the use of BIC in the first
    place.

    For this study, geostatistical methods of estimation (kriging)
    were used. These methods have not been applied to demography in
    this form before. The estimation of the regional fertility in
    India was based on the censuses of 1961, 1971, 1981 and 1991. Two
    approaches were considered, which both gave a similar spatial
    distribution of the estimated variable for the four censuses.

      The supposed decline of the U.S. educational system, including
      its causes and solutions, has been a popular topic of debate in
      recent years. Part of the difficulty in resolving this debate is
      the lack of solid empirical evidence regarding the true impact
      of educational initiatives. For example, educational researchers
      rarely are able to engage in controlled, randomized
      experiments. The efficacy of so-called ``school choice''
      programs has been a particularly contentious issue. A current
      multi-million dollar evaluation of the New York School Choice
      Scholarship Program (NYSCSP) endeavors to shed some light on
      this issue. This study can be favorably contrasted with other
      school choice evaluations in terms of the thought that went into
      the randomized experimental design (a completely new design, the
      Propensity Matched Pairs Design, is being implemented) and the
      rigorous data collection and compliance-encouraging efforts. At
      first appearance, it would appear that the evaluation of the
      NYSCSP could proceed without undue statistical
      complexity. Unfortunately, this program evaluation, as is common
      in studies with human subjects, suffers from some complications:

      1. Non-compliance. Approximately 25% of children who were awarded
          scholarships decided not to use them and approximately 10% of
          those not awarded scholarship attended private school anyway.
      2. Missing data. Some parents failed to complete fully survey
          information. Some children were did not take pre-tests. Some
          children failed to show up for post-tests. Levels of missing
          data range approximately from 3 to 50% across variables.

      Work by Frangakis and Rubin (1997) has revealed the severe
      threats to valid estimates of experimental effects that can
      exist in the presence of non-compliance and missing data, even
      for estimation of simple intention-to-treat effects.

      The evaluation of the NY School Choice Scholarship Program is a
      prime example of the bridge between observational studies and
      randomized designs. Non-compliance and missing data force
      researchers to make assumptions similar to those made in good
      observational studies in order to return it to the ideal of
      perfectly controlled randomized experiment template. The
      Bayesian methodology used is an extension of the standard IV
      methodology which also allows for proper treatment of missing
      data (with more reasonable assumptions than those needed for
      naive treatment of missing data).

    This paper examines the linkage between crack market activity and
    gun homicide suggested by Blumstein (1995), who argues that the
    arrival of crack stimulated an increased availability of guns
    among juveniles. This greater availability of guns, the argument
    continues, is responsible for the sharp upswing in juvenile
    homicide experienced in the United States in the mid-1980's. Using
    city-level data on crack arrests and gun-related juvenile
    homicide, we fit a change-point version of the Bass (1969) model
    of innovation diffusion. We find that, in most large American
    cities, the diffusion process for crack cocaine experienced an
    onset of dramatic growth that was followed by similar, slightly
    slower growth in gun homicides committed by juveniles. We further
    use cluster analysis to find that the spatial patterning of the
    two processes is similar, starting on the East and West Coasts and
    working their way toward other regions of the nation. Gun use in
    homicide among slightly older offenders (ages 18-24) also
    experienced a change at roughly the same time as the juveniles,
    but the rate of diffusion was considerably milder than for the
    younger group; offenders ages 25 or older generally show no growth
    in gun-related homicide whatsoever. In addition, there is no
    detectable surge in juvenile non-gun homicide activity. Based on
    these findings, we conclude that the crack cocaine markets-gun
    availability linkage is highly plausible, and we suggest
    directions for future research in clarifying the dynamics of the
    late-1980's surge in juvenile homicide.

    Using the monthly excess returns on the value weighted portfolio
    of NYSE stocks for the period of 1926:1 - 1998:12, we investigate
    a positive relationship between the equity premium and volatility
    over long and short horizons. One possibility is that structural
    shifts in long run or low-frequency volatility are associated with
    shifts in equity premium. Another possibility is that the equity
    premium changes with high-frequency fluctuations in volatility in
    the form of the volatility feedback effect. Assuming one-time,
    permanent endogenous structural break in the sample, we
    investigate the two possibilities within the Bayesian
    framework. We show that once the structural break in the
    volatility-generating process and the volatility feedback effect
    are controlled for, evidence of structural break in the equity
    premium disappears. This confirms the importance of the volatility
    feedback effect in explaining a positive link between equity
    premium and volatility. In addition, we contend that the
    volatility feedback effect is the major source of mean reversion
    reported in the literature.

    Developmental theories of antisocial behavior commonly distinguish
    between early and late onset delinquency. This presentation will
    describe a generalization of my prior work on a group-based,
    semi-parametric method for trajectory estimation that allows for
    the joint estimation of trajectories of distinct but related
    behaviors. The generalized method will be applied to longitudinal
    data on childhood physical aggression as measured by teacher
    reports and adolescent violent delinquency as measured by self-
    reports. The purpose is to test whether and to what extent there
    is late onset violent delinquency.

    Despite the diverse pedigrees of Data Mining methods, the
    underlying algorithms fall into a handful of families, whose
    properties suggest their likely performance on a given
    dataset. One typically selects an algorithm by matching its
    strengths to the properties of one's data. Yet, performance
    surprises, where competing models rank differently than expected,
    are common; model inference, even when semi-automated, seems to
    yet be as much art as science.

    Recently however, researchers in several fields, statistics,
    economics, computational learning theory, and engineering, have
    discovered that a simple technique -- combining competing models
    -- almost always improves classification accuracy. (Such
    "bundling" is a natural outgrowth of Data Mining, since much of
    the model search process is automated, and candidate models
    abound.)

    This talk will describe a collection of powerful model combination
    methods -- including bagging, boosting, and a little bit of
    Bayesian model averaging -- and briefly demonstrate their positive
    effects on scientific, medical, and marketing case studies. Used
    in combination, I show how these methods may easily incorporate
    many desirable properties including prediction accuracy,
    robustness, variance reduction, model interpretability, and
    scalability to massive datasets.

    Popular theories in political science regarding opinion-changing
    behavior postulate existence of one or both of two broad
    categories of people: those who hold their opinions over time; and
    those that hold no solid opinion and, when asked to make a choice,
    do so seemingly at random. This study explores evidence for a
    third category: durable changers. This group of people will change
    their opinion in a rational, informed manner, after being exposed
    to new information. Survey data collected at four time points over
    nearly two years tracks Swiss citizens' readiness to support
    pollution-reduction policies. The data is incomplete in the 3rd
    and 4th years. Finite mixture models allow estimation of the
    percentage in the population of each category for each
    question. Specific behaviors attributable to each of the three
    groups can be explicitly measured. Data Augmentation is
    implemented to fit the models. Posterior predictive checks and
    Bayes factors are used to explore model fit. Results provide
    evidence for existence of the durable-changer group.

    Learning an ensemble of models instead of a single one can be a
    remarkably effective way to reduce predictive error. Ensemble
    methods include bagging, boosting, stacking, error-correcting
    output codes, and others. But how can we explain the amazing
    success of these methods (and hopefully design better ones as a
    result)? Many different explanations have been proposed, using
    concepts like the bias-variance tradeoff, margins, and Bayesian
    model averaging. However, each of these explanations has
    significant shortcomings. In this talk I will survey the current
    state of knowledge and describe a number of experiments testing
    some of the proposed explanations. One of the most striking
    conclusions is that Bayesian model averaging completely fails to
    explain the success of bagging and related methods. I conclude by
    describing what (according to the experimental evidence) is the
    best current explanation of why ensembles work, showing that the
    explanation is still incomplete, and pointing to where further
    research is needed.

    It is well known that when firms grow by amalgamating with other
    firms (particularly with other firms in the same sector) they must
    confront the problem of unifying distinct operating practices. It
    is also relatively well understood (by employees if by no one
    else) that growth through merger may disrupt occupational
    expectations at the individual level.

    What is less obvious (and certainly less well studied) is the
    extent to which particular historical solutions to the problem of
    weaving discrete organizations into a single large firm can have
    distinctive structural implications for broader labor markets and
    systems of careers. It is this linkage, between the
    intra-organizational dynamic triggered by massive amalgamation and
    the production of new understandings of careers and ultimately
    middle class labor markets, that is the analytic focus of this
    paper. I will begin to empirically demonstrate this linkage by
    analyzing over one-hundred years of detailed organizational and
    occupational data, drawn from the archives of Lloyds Bank, one of
    the oldest, and still one of the largest, of England's Banks.

    Ovarian cancer is a rare but very deadly disease: Its prevalence
    is about one eight that of breast cancer, but has much poorer
    overall 5-year survival rate; 38% for of ovarian cancer cases die
    within five years compared to 76% of breast cancer cases.
    However, when found with a comparable stage, women with ovarian
    cancer and breast cancer can expect comparable 5-year survival:
    85% (ovarian) and 90% (breast) when local, and

    18% (ovarian) and 19% (breast) when distant. The worse prognosis for ovarian cancer
    is due to the large proportion of ovarian cancers found in an advanced state;
    25% of ovarian cancers are detected locally, compared to 49% of breast cancers.  This
    gives a compelling case to improve ovarian cancer survival by detecting it earlier
    by screening.

    Screening intends to reduce ovarian cancer mortality, but because it is a rare
    disease, any candidate screening program should also be cost effective to justify
    using it in the general population. Moreover, cancer screening is not a benign
    undertaking, and has its own risks and adverse effects.  A positive screen can
    induce substantial stress on an individual, and so screening policies need to
    minimize the rates of false positives to control

    social burden. This is especially true for ovarian cancer, because a false positive
    test results in an invasive surgery on a woman who is without the disease. Currently,
    nearly twenty ovarian surgeries are performed for every cancer detected.  Candidate
    strategies for ovarian cancer screening can make use of  highly sensitive but
    unspecific imaging technology, either alone or combined with  a specific but only
    marginally sensitive tumor marker (CA125). In the future, other tumor markers
    my also be used. We will use a

    comprehensive microsimulation model to study competing experimental strategies
    for ovarian cancer screening using these technologies.  We will find that no single
    strategy is best on all performance measures; mortality reduction, cost-effectiveness,
    and social burden.  We will also outline our research efforts for finding  highly
    cost effective screening algorithms for ovarian cancer.

    Here are two problems arguably faced by those hoping to generalize
    about the determinants of policy change in Congress and other
    legislatures: First, what is the unit of analysis?  Researchers
    often write of long-term changes in support for a "policy," but
    what Congress actually considers are bills, and bills die at the
    end of each two-year congress.  Second, if we think of Congress
    considering a population of policy proposals, how does the
    researcher draw a sample to study?  These questions have not been
    seriously addressed by social scientists.  Possible answers will
    be suggested, with comments and other proposals welcomed.

    The paper examines the hypothesis that, in  a properly-functioning
    representational system with fully rational actors there should exist no
    relationship at the macro level between representatives' activities and demand
    for policies on the part of voters.  Over time, a measure of the reaction of
    voters to public policy outputs should approximate a random walk in such a
    system. We examine the distributions in changes in election margins for a
    variety of elections to show that the prediction of fully endogenous
    representation does not hold and propose an alternative model based on
    boundedly rational decision-making processes.

    Social psychology has pointed to a number of possible ways
    characteristics of groups may affect individual behavior and how
    individuals may change their behavior within a group.  Recently the
    prevention literature has raised issues regarding the practice of placing
    "high risk" youth together in intervention groups for the
    purposes of preventing high risk outcomes (e.g. drug use) arguing that
    such settings lead to increased delinquency/risk.  In general, the impact
    of group characteristics in such settings has received little attention
    and raises a number of modeling and statistical issues.   This paper
    represents some preliminary work in this direction by exploring how group
    characteristics may influence individual change in desired skills and
    outcomes in an intervention setting.  I present some preliminary
    contextual growth models to explore how individual growth trajectories
    may differ across contexts and, in general, raise some conceptual issues
    in attempting to address this task.

    Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data

    We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens
    to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes,
    cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than
    zeros ("nonevents"). In many literatures, these variables have
    proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to
    have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures,
    such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the
    probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that
    outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute
    and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported
    in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection
    strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear
    of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections
    with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly
    measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict
    data with more than a quarter million dyads, only a few of which
    are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist
    for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events
    (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of non-events (peace). This
    enables scholars to save as much as 99% of their (non-fixed) data
    collection costs, or to collect much more meaningful explanatory
    variables. We provide methods that link these two results,
    enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and
    software that implements the methods developed.

    Inference in Case-Control Studies With Limited Auxilliary Information

    We address a disagreement between epidemiologists and
    econometricians (and also among several camps within the medical,
    epidemiological, and public health literatures) about inference
    from the simplest type of case-control samples. To estimate the
    conditional probability of disease, the relative risk, or the risk
    difference in these data, some assumption about the population
    fraction of "cases" is necessary. This population fraction is
    assumed to be effectively zero by epidemiologists and known
    exactly, but not necessarily zero, by econometricians. Since the
    population fraction is usually not known exactly, more recent
    econometric literature assumes complete ignorance. Methods based
    on this ignorance assumption produce bounds on the quantities of
    interest that, unfortunately, are often wide and always encompass
    a conclusion of no treatment effect (relative risks of one or risk
    differences of zero) no matter how strong the true effect is. We
    simplify the existing bounds for risk differences, making them
    easier to estimate, and then suggest a resolution of the
    disagreement by providing a method that allows researchers to
    include easily available information (e.g., that the fraction of
    cases in the population falls within [.2,.3]); this method avoids
    unrealistic assumptions and considerably narrows the bounds and
    hence confidence intervals on all quantities of interest. We also
    offer public-domain software for all methods introduced, and
    discuss implications for reporting standards in applied research.

    In most observational studies and in some randomized experiments,
    matching or adjusting for selection bias often leads to a more
    relevant summary of the data, particularly where causal hypotheses
    are concerned. For example, in evaluating the effects of drug and
    alcohol exposure in utero using a longitudinal cohort of mothers
    and infants, it would be typical to match exposed and unexposed
    infants on several maternal characteristics believed to effect
    both in utero exposure and the longitudinal outcome of interest,
    eg brain functioning. But what if one also wished to adjust for
    differential post-utero maternal environments? In this and many
    other scenarios, the hypothetical intervention of interest is
    longitudinal and thus so may be the selection bias. The goal of
    this talk is to offer and elicit perspectives on various methods
    in use for summarizing the effect of a longitudinal intervention
    with nonideal data. Additional examples to be considered are:
       
    - the evaluation of psychiatric care for treatment of depression
    - the etiology of cervical cancer
    - the 1997 faculty salary study
    - socio-temporal networks analysis

    The paper examines the hypothesis that, in  a properly-functioning
    representational system with fully rational actors there should exist no
    relationship at the macro level between representatives' activities and demand
    for policies on the part of voters.  Over time, a measure of the reaction of
    voters to public policy outputs should approximate a random walk in such a
    system. We examine the distributions in changes in election margins for a
    variety of elections to show that the prediction of fully endogenous
    representation does not hold and propose an alternative model based on
    boundedly rational decision-making processes.

    The most common way for governments to protect the population from
    environmental insults, such as air or water pollution, is to set a
    standard. Most standards consist of two parts: a cutoff value beyond
    which health risks are deemed unacceptable, and an implementation rule,
    specifying how compliance with the standard will be ascertained. We
    illustrate the concepts with two US environmental standards, one for
    air pollution and one for water pollution. From a statistical point of
    view, the US EPA implementation rules in these examples have poor
    performace characteristics. We present a statistician's first stab at
    improving the implementation. Complications such as spatial and
    temporal dependence, and network design bias, are discussed.'

     In a bloodless uprising against the statistical establishment of then
     1940-1960's, economists have developed a language for causation -- structural
     equation models (SEM).  Today, this language serves as a basic modeling tool
     in econometrics and the social and behavioral sciences, though it is still
     a mystery to statisticians and a semi-mystery to its practitioners.  In this
     talk, I will show how the SEM language, enriched with a few concepts from logic
     and graph theory, offers a powerful conceptual and mathematical framework for
     managing difficult nonlinear problems in causal and counterfactual analysis.
     I will survey three such problems: (1) the identification of policy effects,
     (2) the assessment of causal attributions in specific scenarios, and (3) the
     separation andnassessment of direct and indirect effects.

    One of the major applications of data mining is in helping companies
    determine which potential customers to market to. If the expected profit from
    a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action
    for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only
    the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to
    her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the
    expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the
    customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a
    market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and
    model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach
    using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database.
    Marketing that exploits the network value of customers-also known
    as viral marketing-can be extremely effective, but is still a black art.
    Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation
    for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.

    An important question in the field of political economy is whether a
    country's economic development fosters political democracy. For example,
    using statistical analyses of nations, scholars have concluded that
    development increases democracy by producing a middle class and tolerant
    attitudes, or by increasing the division of labor which creates a demand for
    more complex political institutions. In contrast, comparative historical
    research finds that the effect of economic development on political
    democracy is contingent, varying greatly across countries and historical
    periods. Thus, research in this area yields depending on method used
    (comparative-historical or statistical) divergent findings. Kim and Kim will
    seek to reconcile this devergence using improved measures models for time
    series data.

    Statistics began its emergence 200 years ago to meet needs of
    science and government, and has enjoyed considerable success in
    guiding a wide range of quantitative studies for over 100 years.
    Why, then, is it not considered part of everyone's basic
    education?  Why is it still among the most despised of
    undergraduate college courses?  Why has its use not become
    epidemic in business, industry, and government?  Is progress being
    made to remedy these situations?  The answer to the last question
    is a qualified "yes," but the lessons of the past must be taken to
    heart if statistics is to move to the forefront of quantitative
    education and scientific practice. Opportunities abound, however,
    and the future could be bright!

    While sociologists and economists recognize that employment is fundamentally
    a problem of matching workers with jobs, most empirical research on
    occupations and labor markets has focused on either the structure of supply
    of workers or the structure of demand for workers.  While some have
    recognized job searching as the mechanism by which individual jobs and
    workers find each other, few labor market models formally incorporate
    different recruitment strategies into the matching process. The goal of this
    study is to develop a dynamic two-sided employment model in which the
    information available to workers and employers about each other may be
    constrained by characteristics of workers and of jobs, as well as on network
    ties between workers.  Using simulation, we explore the system-level
    properties (measured in terms such as turnover rates, over- and
    under-qualification of workers, duration of vacancies) resulting from
    various recruitment strategies.

    The standard means for estimating mortality schedules from incomplete
    data is based on relational life table methods attributable to Brass (e.g.,
    1974).  I will discuss the extension of these methods with the application
    of simple conjugate Bayesian models for estimating mortality schedules.  In
    the case of anthropological demography, the very robust features of the
    human life cycle suggest that informative prior distributions can be
    posited, greatly assisting estimation of mortality parameters from
    incomplete data.  I also hope to apply these methods to the case of
    estimating demographic schedules from the hopelessly incomplete data on the
    mortality and reproductive biology of the great apes.  Using estimates
    derived from this approach, I will attempt to quantify the risk of
    extinction faced by these species in the coming century.

    In a recent article on the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy, Berlowitz
    et al (1998) introduced an ad hoc method of adjusting for serial
    confounding assessed via an intensity score, which records cumulative
    differences over time between therapy actually received and therapy
    predicted by prior medical history.  Outcomes are subsequently regressed
    on the intensity score and baseline covariates to determine whether
    intense treatment or exposure predicts a favorable response.  We supply
    sufficient conditions for interpreting results of the Berlowitz approach
    based on a causal model for the effect of a time-varying exposure.  We
    also consider a modified version in which the intensity score records
    cumulative scaled differences over time between therapy actually received
    and therapy predicted by prior medical history.  This leads to a simple,
    two-step implementation of G-estimation if we assume a nonstandard but
    useful structural nested mean model which implies that subjects less
    likely to receive treatment are more likely to be helped by it.  These
    modeling assumptions might apply, for instance, to certain health services
    research contexts in which differential access to care is a primary
    concern.  We also extend the methods to accomodate repeated outcomes and
    time-varying effects of time-varying exposures.

    We develop a latent curve model for longitudinal data which
    captures underlying stochastic variation in an interpretable
    manner. The approach decomposes the variation into data-adaptive
    components, which we call proto-splines. These proto-splines are
    linear combinations of basis functions chosen to reflect important
    features of the process under investigation. Our approach can be
    viewed as a hybrid of principal components analysis and the usual
    basis function approach to functional data analysis. The resulting
    components should be more interpretable than principal components
    and are more flexible than those employed in the basis function
    approach. Our proto-spline model class extends the scope of
    traditional mixed effects models, but still retains their emphasis
    on the estimation of components of variance, which often have
    substantive meaning. We prove the parameter estimates are
    consistent, asymptotically efficient, and Gaussian. An application
    to the analysis of wage inequality based on the National
    Longitudinal Survey of Young Men is presented.

    The role of marriage has undergone profound change in recent decades.
    Divorce and cohabitation have become commonplace, and age at first marriage
    has increased for both men and women. These shifts in marriage patterns have
    been accompanied by changes in assortative mating-that is, the types of
    partners individuals choose when they do form unions. This study will
    contribute to the literature on marriage and assortative mating in four
    ways. First, it will estimate assortative mating based on multiple outcomes.
    Previous research has examined assortative mating on education, testing the
    extent to which mating is homogamous (partners select partners with similar
    education), and examining trends in such patterns. This study will examine
    assortative mating on income and other outcomes. Second, it will develop a
    methodology for estimating the determinants of multiple union types,
    generalizing the binary outcome for marriage to an ordered polychotomous
    outcome for cohabiting, married, or neither. Third, it will allow for
    non-linearity and non-monotonicity in estimating the relationship between
    individual characteristics and union status on the one hand, and degree of
    assortative mating on the other. Fourth, it will compare assortative mating
    patterns for cohabiting and married couples and for early and later cohorts.
    Lam's model predicts that cohabiting couples will be more similar than
    married couples, and that assortative mating has increased over time. Fifth,
    it will estimate a model of partner choice that allows for selection into
    marital or union status. Because married (and cohabiting) couples are not a
    random sample of the population, estimates of one partner's characteristics
    on those of the other is subject to sample selection bias. This can be
    addressed within the selection framework proposed.

    Much, if not most, social network data is derived from informant
    self-reports or participant observation; past research, however, has
    indicated that such reports are in fact highly inaccurate representations of
    social interaction.  Although this problem has been known for over two
    decades, little consensus has developed concerning what might be done about
    it.  Here, I demonstrate a simple family of hierarchical Bayesian models
    which allow for the simultaneous inference of informant accuracy and social
    structure in the presence of measurement error.  Thoughts regarding the
    potential for further development in this area -- and some ruminations on

    Scientists everywhere have been seduced by statistical training
    into interpreting P-values, statistical significance, and
    confidence intervals as if those statistics are "what the data
    say" about associations and effects, and have been encouraged to
    believe that simple statistical methods "let the data speak for
    themselves." Both beliefs are fallacious. Without exception, all
    conventional statistics are computed from a model for data
    probabilities, and so are what a model says about the data. To
    claim otherwise involves two logical errors. One error is the
    confusion of probabilities of data given hypotheses with
    probabilities of hypotheses given data; the latter are computed
    only in Bayesian analyses. This error is equivalent to confusing
    the sensitivity of a diagnostic test with the test's predictive
    value, and is widely discussed. The second error is acknowledged
    only rarely: Any simple method must be based on a simple
    ("parsimonious") model, which imposes more restrictions than a
    complex regression generalization of the model. As a consequence,
    a simple method has more capacity to misrepresent data patterns
    than its generalization; indeed, data misrepresentation is one
    major complaint against statistical hypothesis testing. These
    logical problems may be avoided by integrating data explanation
    into data analysis, provided one learns to distinguish data from
    statistics.

    A fundamental problem in many disciplines, including political
    science, sociology and epidemiology, is to examine the association
    between two binary variables within a series of 2x2 tables, when
    only the margins are observed, and one of the margins is
    fixed. Various approaches to such ecological inference problems
    have been proposed, generating a great deal of controversy.  Much
    of this controversy stems from the assumptions, often not
    explicitly stated, that underlie proposed approaches.  A number of
    these approaches impose a hierarchy in which the pair of
    probabilities that characterize the table are assumed to arise
    from a distribution.  Under a number of assumptions, the
    likelihood is a convolution of binomial distributions and is
    awkward to work with, and so a variety of approximations have been
    utilised.  We work directly with the convolution likelihood and
    provide computational schemes for sampling from the posterior
    corresponding to this likelihood.  A number of approximations that
    are useful for tables with large margins are also described, and
    the convolution likelihood is related to previous
    approximations. We suggest a non-hierarchical baseline model that
    may be applied to each table separately in order to quantify the
    amount of information on the pair of probabilities that is
    provided by the data in each table alone.  This model provides a
    starting point for analysis, and also allows other proposed
    models, such as common probabilities across areas, or the
    imposition of a hierarchy, to be critically assessed.  In
    particular the information that is purely a function of the
    hierarchical prior may be examined.  We also clarify the
    importance of the design, that is, the distribution over areas of
    the numbers in the fixed margin of the table.  Registration/race
    data from 275 US counties are used to illustrate the methods.  A
    number of extensions are outlined including the consideration of
    multi-way tables, spatial dependence and area-specific
    (contextual) variables.'

    Deterministic simulation models are used in many areas, including
    demographic population projections, the investigation of social
    scientific theories, environmental science, engineering, and
    atmospheric science.  They tend to be complex, and to require the
    specification of many inputs. This is often done in an ad-hoc
    manner, and little attention has been given to taking proper
    account of uncertainty and evidence about the inputs and outputs
    to the model. Statisticians have only fairly recently started to
    be involved in the analysis of such models.


    I first got involved in this problem through my work for the
    International Whaling Comission on determining if bowhead whales
    could safely be subjected to aboriginal subsistence hunting by the
    Inuit people of Alaska, and on setting the quota. This has
    traditionally been done using deterministic population dynamics
    models, similar to those that are used by demographers for
    population projections. I will describe our Bayesian melding
    method, which provides a formal framework for estimating and
    taking account of uncertainties and evidence about model inputs
    and outputs, model comparison, model validation, and accounting
    for model uncertainty via Bayesian model averaging.


    I will also briefly describe a new project that is just starting
    on assessing and visualizing uncertainty in mesoscale numerical
    weather prediction. This is a very high-dimensional problem and
    poses big research challenges to the Bayesian melding approach.
    It is an interdisciplinary project involving atmospheric
    scientists and psychologists, as well as statisticians.

    Is the remarkable level of cooperation among unrelated humans
    based in part on the distinctive capacities of humans to construct
    institutional environments which limit competition and reduce
    phenotypic variation within groups, allowing individually-costly
    but ingroup-beneficial behaviors to coevolve with these supporting
    environments through a process of inter-demic group selection? We
    model a deme-structured population in which group differences in
    institutions are culturally transmitted and individual behaviors
    may be genetically or culturally transmitted. We use simulations
    of a standard extended fitness accounting framework to identify
    the parameter space for which this coevolutionary process
    generates high levels of ingroup-beneficial behaviors.

    We show that intergroup conflicts may explain the evolutionary
    success of both: (a) altruistic forms of human sociality towards
    non-kin; and (b) group-level institutional structures such as food
    sharing and monogamy which have emerged and diffused repeatedly in
    a wide variety of ecologies during the course of human
    history. Ingroup-beneficial behaviors may evolve if i) they
    inflict sufficient costs on outgroup individuals and ii)
    group-level institutions limit the individual costs of these
    behaviors and thereby attenuate within-group selection against
    these behaviors.

    Our simulations show that if group-level institutions implementing
    resource sharing or non-random pairing among group members are
    permitted to evolve, group-beneficial individual traits coevolve
    along with these institutions, even where the latter impose
    significant costs on the groups adopting them. In the absence of
    these group-level institutions, however, group-beneficial traits
    evolve only when intergroup conflicts are very frequent, groups
    are small, and migration rates are low. Thus the evolutionary
    success of individually-costly but group-beneficial behaviors in
    the relevant environments during the first 90,000 years of
    anatomically modern human existence may have been a consequence of
    distinctive human capacities in social institution-building.

    Society through its governmental institutions regulates individual and
    collective behavior. A current case is that of EPA's new standards for particulate
    matter and ozone. The history of the setting of these standards is a fascinating
    story of the interplay of science, policy and values in which statistics and statisticians
    have played an unusually large role. In this talk I want to give an overview and
    point to challenges and challengers. The challenges come up because largely statistical
    evidence convinced the regulators that there was a problem. Now the challengers
    are asking us to provide statistical approaches to verifying that the regulations
    are having the desired effect; in other words, provide accountability.   The Health
    Effects Institute (itself a product of the interaction of regulators and those
    regulated) in its strategic plan for 2000-2005 raises three questions regarding
    accountability in the area of regulation of air quality:

    These questions provide a reasonable framework for the statistical questions that
    are being generated.

    The advantages and disadvantages of sample versus population data
    collections point strongly to their being complementary. The advantages of
    population data are that they are without sampling error and may be much
    less subject to biases due to non-response. The advantages of sample surveys
    are in the large amounts of information collected about each sampled,
    responding individual. The present study combines population-level
    information with sample data within a likelihood framework to exploit these
    advantages. The application is to marital fertility and divorce. Maximum
    likelihood estimation is implemented as a constrained optimization problem
    where the population data provide the "constraints." These are year-specific
    divorce rates, and age-, year- and race-specific marital fertility rates.
    The survey data are from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). These
    contribute more detailed information on the length of the marriage, and on
    number and timing of children born within and before the marriage. Separate
    equations are estimated for divorce and marital fertility. Large reductions
    in both variance and bias are obtained by implementing the constrained
    estimation. These equations are then used in a simulation of the formation
    and dissolution of two-parent families. Variance about statistics resulting
    from the simulation (e.g., proportion of marriages that end in divorce
    before the youngest child attains age 18) is estimated by a Monte Carlo
    method.

    At the heart of attitudinal and strategic explanations of judicial
    behavior is the assumption that justices have well-defined policy
    preferences.  To test implications of either explanation,
    researchers need measures of the justices' underlying policy
    preferences. In the literature these preferences have been
    measured in a handful of ways, including looking at past votes in
    a single policy area (Epstein, Walker, and Dixon 1989),
    content-analyzing newspaper editorials at the time of appointment
    to the Court (Segal and Cover 1989), and recording the background
    characteristics of the justices (Tate and Handberg 1991). Scholars
    have used these measures succesfully to explain behavior in some
    policy areas, including civil rights, but have been less
    successful in others, such as economics cases (Epstein and Mershon
    1996).


    In this paper we posit a simple formal-theoretic model of voting
    on the Court that we use to specify a Bayesian measurement model
    of judicial policy preferences.  In so doing, we simultaneously
    estimate a bliss point for each justice in a multidimesional space
    and the cutting hyperplane for each non-unanimous case.  The
    Bayesian approach also allows us to include background information
    about the justices' ideal points in a straightforward manner, and
    allows us to gauge the uncertainty of each estimate by summarizing
    the posterior density.  We employ Bayes factors (Kass and Raftery
    1995) to gauge the dimensionality of the issue space, and to test
    various model specifications.  With our measures in hand, we
    further explore: (1) the reliability and validity of the measures;
    (2) how these estimates compare to extant preference measures; (3)
    the dimensionality of the Supreme Court issue space; and (4) how
    substantive issues, coded by Spaeth (1999), map into this
    multidimensional space.

    Growth in the U.S. penal system over the last 25 years has produced extraordinarily
    high incarceration rates among unskilled men. In 1996 more than 7% of young white
    male high school dropouts and 36% of young black male dropouts were in prison
    or jail (Western and Pettit 2000). High incarceration rates together with the
    poor job prospects of ex-inmates suggest that the prison system has expanded its
    historical role of punishing the most severe criminal offenders to providing an
    institutionalized influence over the life chances of a large proportion of disadvantaged
    men.  This paper examines the extent to which prison time has become a routine
    event in the life course of unskilled and minority men.  We investigate this idea
    by estimating detailed incarceration rates and cumulative risks of imprisonment
    by age, race, ethnicity, and education. Although many researchers try to explain
    the growth in incarceration, few study the changing composition of the inmate
    pool and the incarceration risks of different demographic groups. A detailed picture
    of these risks is central to assessing the impact of prison system growth on broad
    patterns of social inequality.

    For nearly a century, social theorists have recognized that
    behavior is a function of two quite different factors: values -
    that is, individual's relative evaluations of the attractiveness
    of their available courses of action, and the constraints that
    these individuals face in their environment. However, attempts to
    measure values have often come up short. This study will compare
    the predictive reliability of a new measurement strategy, based on
    factorial survey techniques, to the traditional strategy, based on
    surveys in which respondents are directly questioned. Unlike the
    traditional measurement strategy, the factorial approach entails
    substantial statistical modeling.

    The structure of sexual contact networks plays a central role in the
    epidemic behavior of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs).  One specific
    aspect of network structure that has received a great deal of attention is
    the network degree distribution.  Recent work has argued that the
    underlying degree distribution in human sexual contact networks could
    permit the spread and maintenance of an STD regardless of the
    transmissibility of the pathogen, complicating STD eradication. In this
    talk, we will develop several candidate stochastic models for the degree
    distribution of a sexual network. The general categories of stochastic
    model include: (1) Poisson models, (2) preferential attachment models, and
    (3) bi-relationship models.  We present the results of Maximum Likelihood
    fits of the different models using data from three large sexual behavior
    surveys: The Rakai Sexual Network Study, Uganda; The Swedish Survey of
    Sexual Behaviour; and the National Health and Social Life Survey, USA.
    Using a standard degree-based epidemic model, we calculate the epidemic
    thresholds under the different models. We use likelihood-based model
    selection procedures to compare the fits of the different models to the
    three data sets. The results indicate that in all three populations lower
    epidemic thresholds exist, suggesting that public health interventions
    aimed at reducing transmissibility (e.g., promotion of condom use, or
    HAART) could be effective in reducing STD prevalence.  Curiously, the
    results also indicate that upper thresholds do not exist either, implying
    that an STD epidemic would be impossible on the inferred network
    structure, regardless of its transmissibility.  This result in particular
    highlights the weakness of degree-based models for sexual networks and STD
    epidemics thereon.  We conclude the talk with a discussion of
    dependency-model alternatives to the standard degree-based models.

    Although researchers have repeatedly documented the effect of
    workers' sex on their occupational outcomes, we know little about
    how workers' race, ethnicity, and Hispanicity shape their
    distribution across detailed occupations.  Using the 1990 PUMS
    data, we examine occupational segregation across 500 detailed
    occupations on the basis of workers' race, ethnic ancestry, and
    Hispanic origin, as well as their sex.  We begin by computing
    indices of dissimilarity among all employed workers categorized
    into 60 groups defined by their sex, Hispanicity, and detailed
    race and ethnicity.  We then analyze these indices with
    multidimensional scaling to identify the dimensions underlying the
    structure of occupational segregation by sex, race, ethnicity, and
    Hispanicity.  The MDS results provide graphic depictions of the
    patterns of occupational segregation among the 60 groups.
    Finally, we use regression analysis of groups' position on the
    two underlying dimensions both to discern which broad racial
    categories play a role in workers' occupational segregation and
    to interpret the meaning of the dimensions structuring groups'
    occupational segregation.

    The Implicit Association Test (IAT) provides a measure of
    strengths of associations among concepts, such as the association of
    positive or negative valence with stigmatized social categories (racial or
    ethnic groups, elderly, etc.)  The measure of association strength test is
    computed from latencies of responses to a series of instances of the
    concepts.  Virtues of the measure are that the respondent (a) need not be
    aware of the associations, (b) cannot readily control the manifestations of
    association strengths that the test elicits, and (c) is often surprised and
    either enlightened or disturbed (or both) by these manifestations.  Four
    data sets each of about 10,000 respondents X 200 responses were used to
    explore alternative methods of combining the IAT's latency and error data
    into association strength measures, with the objective of maximizing
    construct validity of the measure.

    Strongly recommended (and easy to obtain) background: Doing two
    tests should take max. 15 minutes.  The site has additional

    Endowing cooperative agents with asymmetric power in a set of
    agent-based models based upon a group of repeated (2X2) games
    (Prisoners Dilemma, Chicken, Stag, Assurance, and Deadlock)
    substantially increases the chances that both cooperative agents
    survive and that cooperative worlds evolve.  This was particularly
    the case when agents are endowed with the ability to selectively
    interact with other agents in their world.  These results are
    consistent with the general finding that non-compulsory play
    consistently helps cooperators.  The question addressed in this
    analysis is whether or not asymmetric power also helps exploitive
    agents is such evolutionary game environments.  Contrary to
    expectations, the simulation results reported here suggest that
    exploitive agents do not benefit from asymmetric power.  In effect
    there is an asymmetry in the benefits of asymmetric power.

    In this talk I propose that the task of constructing models for
    social networks is assisted by recognising that the social
    processes underlying network formation are interactive, dynamic,
    and socially-situated.  (They are dynamic and interactive in that
    the formation of a tie between a pair of actors may both depend on
    and, in turn, influence the formation of ties among other pairs of
    actors; they are socially-situated in that network ties depend on,
    and also, in turn, influence, a multi-layered complex of social
    entities that includes not only other social relations, but also
    group affiliations, sociocultural and psychological orientations,
    and social and geographical settings.)  I briefly review how
    exponential random graph models represent networks as the outcome
    of such interactive processes, and I argue that the problem of
    model specification is the problem of specifying plausible
    neighbourhood assumptions for the models from our knowledge of
    these interactive processes.  I then present two extensions of the
    general modelling approach that emphasise, in turn, the
    socially-situated and dynamic nature of the underlying network
    processes.  I conclude with some comments on the modelling
    problems and prospects raised by these developments.

    Degrees (the number of links attached to a given node) play a
    particular and important role in empirical network analysis
    because of their obvious importance for expressing the position of
    nodes. Some recent work might suggest the conclusion that degree
    distributions are expressive also of structural aspects of
    networks and their dynamics, where the term "structure" refers, in
    a loose sense, to phenomena involving sets of three or more nodes
    (such as transitivity, hierarchy, subgroup formation, etc.).  It
    is argued here that there is no general straightforward relation
    between the degree distribution on one hand and structural aspects
    on the other hand, as this relation depends on further
    characteristics of the presumed model for the network. Therefore
    empirical inference from observed network characteristics to the
    processes that could be responsible for network genesis and
    dynamics cannot be based only, or mainly, on the observed degree
    distribution.

    As an elaboration and practical implementation of this point, a
    statistical model for the dynamics of networks (expressed as
    digraphs) is proposed in which the out-degree distribution is
    governed by parameters that are not connected to the parameters
    for the structural dynamics. It could be said that such an
    approach treats the parameters for the degree distribution as
    nuisance parameters and has the purpose to minimize the influence
    of the observed degrees on the conclusions about the structural
    aspects of the network dynamics. The model is a stochastic
    actor-oriented model, extending the model of Snijders
    (Sociological Methodology, 2001). It deals with the degrees in a
    manner resembling Tversky's Elimination by Aspects approach: when
    an actor (node) changes an outgoing tie, the first aspect
    considered is the out-degree, and the second aspect is the
    resulting structure. A statistical procedure for parameter
    estimation in this model is proposed, and some examples illustrate
    the extent to which inference about structural aspects can be
    influenced by assumptions about actor preferences/constraints for
    the out-degree distribution.

    Rational actor-based sociological models (such as two-sided
    logit and probit models) face a fundamental data problem which seems to
    limit their applicability for addressing certain questions about large
    populations. Specifically, outcomes involving voluntary, mutual choice --
    such as the formation of marriage, employment or network connections --
    are generated conditionally on the particular social contexts available
    to actors, that is, on the presence of other actors available as
    potential partners for marriage, employment or networking. While it is
    feasible to enumerate all potential partners in a workgroup or other
    small organization, it seems impossible to obtain data on all the
    potential marriage, employment, or networking partners that a typical
    adult may have had available prior to the formation of observed
    partnerships in a large population. Yet this information is critical to
    understanding which partnerships will actually form.

    This presentation will consider what should be done to apply and validate
    rational actor models in samples from large populations. (Previous
    statistical work on these models has assumed the population is observed.)
    The discussion will be motivated by emphasizing the important questions
    that available data sets seem to call forth, and the interesting and
    plausible answers that rational actor models provide to these questions
    under simplifying assumptions. I will argue that a suitable strategy is
    to begin by assuming that samples from large populations effectively
    represent local social contexts of choices, for reasons that are perhaps
    not obvious and are certainly debatable. How this assumption can be
    tested and refined will be considered. Though a limited set of sampling
    results from simulated populations will be presented, the discussion will
    be largely nontechnical.

    Women earn less money, on average, than men in all industrialized
    countries.   In the past few decades most advanced industrialized nations
    have witnessed a decline in the gender wage gap, although the size of the
    gap and the rate of decline varies cross nationally.  In this research, we
    examine how public policies and institutional arrangements influence labor
    force participation, and the extent to which labor market selectivity
    affects cross-national estimates of gender equity in earnings.  Although
    there is substantial concern that labor market selectivity may vary
    systematically across countries, previous research has not constructed
    reasonable estimates of the effects of selection.   Using data from the
    Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), we estimate the effect of selectivity into
    the labor force on measures of gender equity in earnings using Bayesian
    methods developed for non-ignorable non-response.  We estimate earnings
    equations for women and men employed in the paid labor force.  We then
    adjust the earnings gap by estimating expected earnings for women and men
    not employed in the labor force.   The imputed wage can be understood as
    an effort to monetize the economic status of women who are often ignored
    in studies of economic inequality. The adjusted wage differential provides
    a compendium measure of the relative economic status of women as a whole,
    including those who are not working.

    Over the last two decades, the persistence and slight decline of the
    population-level black-white earnings gap of men belies important
    heterogeneity found within.  Using a mixture of traditional regression
    modeling and non-parametric weighting estimators, we adopt a consistent
    social class schema for March CPS data and analyze trends in the
    black-white earnings gap of men between 1982 and 2000.  We show that the
    steady decline in the gap among full-time, full-year workers is
    concentrated among semi-skilled and unskilled workers (classes VI and
    VIIa)  and is particularly pronounced among supervisors of manual workers
    (a large proportion of class V).  Three explanations combine to produce
    this pattern.  First, in the context of growing wage inequality in
    general, white men at the bottom of the class distribution have been
    unable to maintain their wage advantages over their black counterparts to
    the same degree that white men at the top of the class distribution have.
    Second, rates of labor market nonparticipation among low-skilled black men
    increased in the 1980s and 1990s (though not as much as they increased in
    the 1960s and 1970s), and this selection out of the labor force has
    accentuated the decline in the relative earnings gaps observed for classes
    V, VI, VIIa.  Third, the tight labor market of the 1990s has
    disproportionately helped the same low-skilled black men.  The relative
    weighting of these three explanations cannot be determined definitively
    with any available data, but the first explanation deserves as much
    attention as the latter two, has not been sufficiently developed in the
    literature on the black-white gap, and is consistent with Sorensen's rent
    destruction explanation for increases in inequality.

    In recent years the Higher Education Funding Council for England
    (HEFCE) and the corresponding bodies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern
    Ireland have become increasingly interested in monitoring the quality with
    which universities carry out their public mandate. In December 2000 HEFCE
    published results on a number of performance indicators for 1996-97 and
    97-98, including drop-out rates after the first year of undergraduate study,
    comparing observed and expected outcomes for all 175 government-funded
    higher education institutions in the UK (this publicly available report
    makes interesting reading; data for 1997-98 have also been published).

    Interpreting the performance indicators effort using the language of causal
    inference, with a binary outcome such as dropout at the student level, (a)
    the process of students choosing and attending universities gives rise to an
    observational study (rather than a controlled experiment), meaning that
    measuring and controlling for potential confounding factors (PCFs) is
    crucial; (b) the supposedly causal factor at the university level is the
    underlying -- and *unobserved* -- quality of the university; and (c) there
    are many student-level PCFs (including age, entry qualifications, and
    subject of study). HEFCE's method of computing expected outcomes given the
    PCFs turns out to be a form of indirect standardization, which we have shown
    is almost equivalent to a version of hierarchical model-based inference in
    which the university effects are treated as fixed and the link function is
    linear.

    In consulting work on behalf of HEFCE we have developed a method of
    shrinkage variance estimation that properly calibrates the HEFCE approach
    and have shown that the numbers of unusually under- and over-achieving
    universities, as far as dropout rates were concerned, in 1996-97 were both
    surprisingly high. In this talk I will describe our calibration work,
    compare fixed-effects and random-effects formulations of the model-based
    version of standardization on their ability to correctly identify "good" and
    "bad" universities, and explore the effects of unobserved student-level PCFs
    on the  results.

    Although the percentage of youngsters graduating from high school
    has increased since the 1970s, a significant proportion of America's high
    school youth continue to drop out of school. Numerous studies have
    identified important individual- and school-level factors associated with
    dropping out. But the models used to identify at youth at risk of school
    failure have largely proved inadequate. This study applies the method of
    "boosting"-a new class of learning algorithms more precisely known as
    "gradient machines"-to improve the accuracy of classification models
    predicting the likelihood of high school failure. While relatively new to
    the field of statistics, boosting has become a popular tool in the machine
    learning community and shows promise in the area of applied problems. This
    study will apply boosting algorithms to data from the National Education and
    Longitudinal Study of 1988, a nationally representative sample of
    adolescents within schools currently in its fourth wave. NELS provides data
    on students' attitudes and behaviors as well as data on family background,
    and other demographics. By applying boosting to the problem of school
    dropout, this study seeks to help teachers and administrators identify
    students most susceptible to school failure, and enable them to direct
    resources for dropout prevention to students in greatest need.

    Survey data in the social and health sciences contain answers to a
    number of yes/no or multiple choice questions (items) for each sampled
    person. The resulting data form a multidimensional contingency table
    where each cell entry is the number of observed responses
    corresponding to a particular discrete response pattern. When the
    items represent a broad underlying concept, such as disability, it is
    often useful to consider the use of statistical methods that capture
    that concept. Latent structure models allow for statistical inference
    about subject or item parameters, or both.

    A relatively new latent structure model, Grade of Membership (GoM),
    deals with individual heterogeneity by introducing a set of extreme
    profiles and a vector of individual membership scores for each extreme
    profile for each individual. We show that the GoM model can
    simultaneously be thought of as being a multivariate latent trait model
    and a constrained latent class model. We treat the membership scores
    as coming from a known distribution and estimate the extreme profiles
    by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm.

    Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of
    Daily Living (IADLs) have a long tradition as powerful predictors
    of future disability and service needs for the elderly. ADLs and
    IADLs are a set of measures of functional disability that are
    considered normal and necessary for everyday living. ADLs include
    basic activities of hygiene and personal care, such as bathing,
    dressing, getting around inside. IADLs include basic activities
    necessary to reside in the community, such as managing money,
    using the telephone, doing grocery shopping. Most of the research
    on changes in functional status over time has been limited to a
    discussion of the total number of ADL/IADL difficulties, without
    regard to the difficulty of the items (ADLs and IADLs). However,
    further questions, e.g., how to measure individual disability more
    precisely, or why disability rates experience changes, require a
    more complex micro-level measure of disability. Latent structure
    models that allow for statistical inference about subject or item
    parameters, or both, can be useful in analyzing functional
    disability data.

    A relatively new latent structure model, Grade of Membership
    (GoM), deals with individual heterogeneity by introducing a set of
    extreme profiles and a vector of individual membership scores for
    each extreme profile for each individual. We show that the GoM
    model can simultaneously be thought of as being a multivariate
    latent trait model and a constrained latent class model. We treat
    the membership scores as coming from a known distribution and
    estimate the extreme profiles by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm.

    We illustrate these concepts and methodology using an extract of 6
    ADL and 10 IADL measures from the National Long Term Care Survey
    data, pooled across four survey waves. The findings demonstrate
    that functional disability among elderly clearly has a
    multidimensional structure which could potentially be successfully
    described by the GoM model. Estimation of the parameters of the
    membership scores distribution and incorporation of the
    longitudinal data structure may be helpful to understand recent
    controversial findings about sharp decline in disability among
    older Americans.

    The virology of HIV creates a strong transmission differential between
    insertive and receptive roles in all forms of sexual contact, with
    transmission being much more likely from an insertive HIV+ partner to a
    receptive HIV- partner than vice versa.  This suggests that among
    populations of men who have sex with men (MSM), the degree of
    individual sexual role segregation should be an important determinant
    of HIV prevalence.  However, this phenomenon has received little
    mathematical exploration, despite the fact that ethnographic research
    has long shown a segregation of sexual roles among MSMs in Latin
    American that now appears to be weakening.  I present a simple
    deterministic model for HIV spread among MSMs that incorporates role
    segregation.  I then use data from a survey of MSMs in Peru to explore
    the effect of reduced role segregation on HIV prevalence.  Implications
    for public health interventions are discussed, as well as future
    refinements to the model. The latter include Bayesian melding to tune
    the model in the face of information about both inputs and outputs, as
    well as stochastic microsimulation to better incorporate heterogeneity
    and dependence among actor's behaviors.

    Network data describe social, physical, and other relations
    between experimental units.  Analysis of such data is complicated by the
    possibility of non-independence of these relations.  We take a latent
    variable approach to analyzing network data, in which the relations between
    two units are conditionally independent of relations with other individuals,
    given an unobserved set of latent positions in an underlying "social
    space". We use such a modeling approach to analyze datasets on a monastery,
    a fourth-grade classroom, and a set of Florentine families. For these
    datasets, the latent variable approach outperforms several existing methods
    of analysis, and also provides a graphical, model-based representation of
    the network data.

    Open-ended (i.e. constructed response) test items have become a
    stock component of standardized educational assessments. Responses
    to open-ended items are usually evaluated by human "raters," often
    with multiple raters judging each response. A pragmatic model of
    an assessment system using rated responses must be able to
    accurately capture the additional variability imposed on the
    system by the raters and address the performance of the raters,
    both as a group and individually. I will contrast the FACETS model
    (Linacre, 1989), a mixed-effects multivariate logistic regression
    model that has been a popular tool for modeling data from rated
    test items, with a fully hierarchical Bayesian model for rating
    data (the Hierarchical Rater Model, HRM, of Patz, Junker, Johnson
    and Mariano, 2002). The HRM makes more realistic assumptions about
    the dependence between multiple ratings of the same student work,
    and thus provides a more realistic view of the uncertainty of
    inferences on parameters and latent variables from rated test
    items. A rigorous treatment of the approach to dependence and
    uncertainty in each model will be presented, followed by an
    exploration the accumulation of information under the HRM, under
    various scenarios of rater performance (especially poor
    performance). The HRM will be explored as a flexible tool in the
    diagnosis of both between and within rater effects by
    incorporating covariates of rater behavior into the hierarchy of
    the model. The effect of modality on the design for distributing
    items among raters on the severity and consistency of individual
    raters performance will be used as an illustration. Both the
    accurate capture of rater variability and the inclusion/exclusion
    of rater covariates create model selection problems where
    parameters easily number in the tens-of-thousands. The adaptation
    of computational methods for the Bayes factor via a Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo processes in this high dimensional setting will be
    discussed.

    The growing nationwide interest in educational assessment and
    accountability emphasizes the importance of accuracy in educational
    measurement.  The use of open-ended (i.e. constructed response) test
    items has become commonplace in standardized educational assessments,
    including national and state-level tests that influence educational
    policy.  Responses to open-ended items are usually evaluated by human
    "raters", often with multiple raters judging each response.  A pragmatic
    model of an assessment system using rated open-ended items must be able to
    accurately capture the variability and dependence among the raters as well
    as address the performance of the raters, both as a group and
    individually.  There is a lack of consensus in the measurement community
    as to an optimal modeling choice, with demonstrably inferior models often
    used in practice.  In this talk, I will compare several models for rating
    data.  One particular choice (the Hierarchical Rater Model, HRM, of Patz,
    Junker, Johnson and Mariano, 2002) provides a more realistic view of the
    uncertainty of inferences on parameters and latent variables from rated
    test items by appropriately accounting for dependence between ratings.  I
    will use the HRM to demonstrate how various levels of rater performance
    affect accuracy in estimates of examinee proficiency.  To illustrate the
    value of the HRM in understanding and improving rater performance, I
    will summarize the results of a study of rating modality---the design
    for distributing items among raters---in a state-level assessment
    program and discuss the potential of the model for incorporating other
    important covariates of rater behavior.

    Adaptive preventive interventions and treatments are a new and
    promising approach involving the individualized tailoring of the
    planned intervention to meet participants' needs. These types of
    treatments constitute an enhancement of the classical randomized
    control trial. In adaptive preventive interventions, treatment
    dosage and/or type of treatment is assigned according to
    prespecified rules, based on each participant's values on key
    characteristics, called dosage moderators. An adaptive
    intervention consists not only of the treatment itself, but the
    treatment inextricably coupled with the dosage moderators,
    measures of dosage moderators, dosage assignment rules, and
    implementation of dosage assignment rules. A properly conducted
    adaptive intervention has the potential to reduce negative
    effects, reduce waste, increase compliance, and enhance
    intervention potency. We discuss fundamental design principles
    aimed at maximizing the strength and replicability of adaptive
    interventions. These principles include: selecting appropriate
    dosage moderators; obtaining valid and reliable measurements of
    these variables; specifying dosage assignment rules that are
    objective, comprehensive, and based on an accurate model of the
    relationship among moderators, treatment dosage, and outcome; and
    optimally implementing these dosage rules. We also discuss the
    role of clinical staff judgment in adaptive interventions. It is
    noted that despite the differences between adaptive preventive
    interventions and fixed preventive interventions, the approach to
    conducting a scientific evaluation of adaptive interventions is
    essentially the same as the approach required for fixed preventive
    interventions. This work is supported by the National Institute on
    Drug Abuse grant P50 DA10075 to the Center for Prevention

    It has long been known that stratifying on variables affected by the
    study exposure can create selection bias. More recently it has been shown
    that stratifying on pre-exposure variables can induce confounding, even
    if no confounder is present to begin with. The present paper examines the
    relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models, in
    which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider
    (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the
    graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables
    affected by exposure and disease may ordinarily be expected to be
    comparable to bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to
    stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases
    from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.

    In previous talks, I have described reasons for rejecting standard
    analytic methods as inadequate for inference from observational data.
    Briefly, those reasons are the failure of standard methods to reflect any
    source of uncertainty other than "random error", and the failure of
    accompanying discussions to adequately capture other sources of
    uncertainty and their interactions. Methods for multiple-bias modeling
    provide alternatives that can capture and integrate major sources of
    uncertainty, thus providing better input to research planning and policy
    analysis. I have concluded that multiple-bias modeling should be
    integrated into the core training of anyone who will be entrusted with
    the analysis of observational data. This presentation reviews these
    arguments, and illustrates some mechanics of multiple-bias modeling in a
    pooled analysis of case-control studies of residential magnetic-field

    Panel data has important advantages over purely cross-sectional or
    time-series data in studying many economic problems, because it contains
    information about both the intertemporal dynamics and the individuality
    of the entities being investigated. A commonly used class of models for
    panel studies identifies the parameters of interest through an
    overdetermined system of estimating equations. Two important problems
    that arise in such models are the following: (1) It may not be clear
    a priori whether certain estimating equations are valid. (2) Some
    of the estimating equations may only "weakly" identify the parameters of
    interest, providing little information about these parameters and making
    inference based on conventional asymptotic theory misleading. A procedure
    based on empirical likelihood for choosing among possible estimators and
    selecting variables in this setting is developed. The advantages of the
    procedure over other approaches in the econometric literature are
    demonstrated through theoretical analysis and simulation studies. Related
    results on empirical likelihood, the generalized method of moments and
    generalized estimating equations are also presented.

    A fundamental problems in many disciplines including sociology,
    political science and epidemiology, is to examine the association
    between two binary variables, a response and a predictor, across a
    set of geographical areas, when only the marginal counts are
    observed.  It is well-known that the marginal data alone are
    consistent with a number of scenarios, and consequently additional
    assumptions are required for non-identifiability to be avoided. In
    this talk a number of proposed approaches will be briefly
    critiqued, and the use of hierarchical models will be discussed in
    detail.  The latter are popular but it will be demonstrated that
    their use requires great care, in particular with respect to the
    choice of hyperparameters, the distribution of the predictor
    variable across areas, and the total number of areas.  A baseline
    model will be described that can be used in exploratory analyses
    to determine the amount of data in the marginal data alone.  We
    motivate the use of a convolution likelihood and relate this to
    previous ad hoc choices.  The explicit specification of a
    likelihood function allows survey and aggregate data to be
    combined, and we provide empirical evidence that efficient
    estimation can arise from a small subsample from a single
    population. The ideas of the talk will be illustrated using data
    on voter registration and race from Louisiana in 1990.

    When using multiple regression to estimate the causal influence of one
    variable (X) on another variable (Y) there is a common belief that the
    inclusion of "irrelevant" covariate(s) (Z) in a multiple regression can
    never introduce bias in the estimate of the effect of X on Y, so long as Z
    is temporally prior to X and Y. In this talk I will first demonstrate that
    this belief is false, and then examine how this confusion has arisen.
    I will then describe sets of additional assumptions under which this
    heuristic is correct, and under which it is approximately correct.
    Finally I will describe practical consequences for the use of multiple
    regression in analyzing observational data.

    The material in this talk is an application of a general theory of causal
    modelling that has been developed by researchers, predominantly in
    Computer Science, within the last 10 years, though it owes its origins to
    earlier work in many disciplines.

    Political scientists make extensive use of "roll call" data (the
    recorded votes of deliberative bodies such as legislatures and courts).  Via
    various data reduction techniques, roll call data generate estimates of (1)
    legislators' preferred positions in a low-dimensional ideological space; (2)
    the ideological content of the proposals considered (and passed into law) by
    the deliberative body. Since roll call data sets are large (either in the
    number of legislators, the number of votes, or both), roll call analysis
    often involves estimating thousands of parameters (the analysis of data from
    standardized tests with Rasch models gives rise to a similar problem).

    Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have emerged as an attractive computing
    strategy for the analysis or roll call data. Moreover, an explicitly
    Bayesian approach provides an elegant way to improve identifiability (via
    proper priors), and to make the statistical analysis of roll call data more
    substantively interesting.  In particular, hierarchical models let us bring
    auxiliary or "expert" information about legislators and proposals to bear
    on the analysis, integrating measurement and tests of structural models of
    legislative behavior.  I will also dwell on issues concerning
    identifiability and Bayesian computation in the high-dimensional context of
    roll call analysis.  The applications are drawn from recent U.S.~congresses,
    past U.S.  congresses (the passage of the civil rights legislation in the
    1960s) and the Supreme Court.

    Establishment of lactation has important biological consequences
    for the health and development of the newborn.  Substantial variation within
    cultures and among different cultures is seen in the onset of breastfeeding.
    We used a series of parametric mixture models to explore this variation and
    to uncover general human patterns for the initiation of breastfeeding.  The
    model components reflect two hypothesized patterns of behavior.  The first
    is a "natural" pattern of breastfeeding that has a rapid onset, and
    reflects, to some extent, a general mammalian behavior. The second behavior
    arises through culturally mediated delays in the initiation of
    breastfeeding.  Candidate models were fit to observation from 25 previously
    published studies of breastfeeding behavior, resulting in interval- or
    right-censored observations of early breastfeeding behavior on 26,220
    mother-infant pairs.  Maximum likelihood estimation revealed that
    two-component models are clearly identified, and cultural and geographic
    covariates were found to have significant effects in the model, including
    the first component.  Although there is clear evidence for two distinct
    behaviors associated with the initiation of breastfeeding, learned behaviors
    play an important role in mediating even the "early onset" behavior.  We
    conclude that the increased reliance on learned rather than preprogrammed
    behaviors characterize the evolution of early maternal behaviors that must
    have accompanied the re-emergence of atricial infants over the course of
    human evolution.

    One of the major applications of data mining is in helping companies
    determine which potential customers to market to. If the expected
    profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her,
    the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in
    this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer
    (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also
    the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other
    customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence,
    and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of
    independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a
    Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using
    social networks mined from a collaborative filtering database and a
    knowledge-sharing Web site. Marketing that exploits the network value of
    customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely
    effective, but is still a black art.  Our work can be viewed as a step
    towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of
    the availability of large relevant databases.

    The spatial model of voting has its roots in work by Hotelling (1929),
    Black (1958) and Downs (1957). In the time since these early works,
    spatial models of voting have proven to be extremely useful in
    understanding a wide variety of social phenomena, including legislative
    behavior, mass voting, judicial behavior, popular referenda, and
    inter-institutional bargaining, among others. It has been known for some
    time that stable outcomes to a voting procedure generally cease to exist
    when dimension of the issue space is greater than or equal to 2 and the
    number of voters is 3 or more (Plott 1967, McKelvey 1976, McKelvey 1979,
    McKelvey and Schofield 1979). The fact that such instabilities do not
    appear frequently in most deliberative bodies has lead several groups of
    scholars to reexamine the assumptions underlying the chaos results. Of
    particular interest to us in this paper is the work on structure induced
    equilibrium (SIE) (Shepsle 1979, Shepsle and Weingast 1981). The key
    insight behind this line of research is that instabilities result from
    the ability of an agenda setter to propose an alternative that shifts
    policy on several dimensions simultaneously. If, on the other hand,
    changes to the status quo must be decided one dimension at a time, then
    a stable outcome will generally exist.

    We propose a statistical measurement model that can be used to estimate
    voter ideal points when (probabilistic) voting is occuring on 1
    dimension at a time in a multidimensional issue space. The model we
    employ turns out to be a finite mixture of item response models in which
    the mixing probabilities depend on a vector of observed covariates. We
    illustrate the model with data from U.S. Supreme Court.

    Considerable research confirms that at-risk youth evidence clusters of
    problem behaviors.  For intervention studies with adolescents, the
    assessment of suicide-risk is often critical and challenging.  Suicide
    risk behaviors often emerge in the research setting because they are
    linked to other problems including substance use, depression, and
    delinquency.  Sorting through the relevance of putative risk and
    protective factors, as well as determining the future likelihood of
    involvement in a given risk behavior remains a challenge for prevention
    scientists.  In this presentation we evaluate the application of CART
    (Classification And Regression Tree) models for depicting the role of
    protective and risk factors on suicide risk.  Data are from a
    stratified random sample of over 1000 high school youth, over-sampling
    high-risk youth (potential school dropouts).  Youth completed a
    questionnaire capturing a range of behaviors/attitudes related to
    school, substance use, mood, family, peers, and self.  In addition,
    each youth received a brief face-to-face interview assessment (Screen
    for Youth Suicide Risk) measuring suicide risk behaviors. CART is used
    to establish best predictors of suicide behaviors (e.g.
    attempts, ideation, threats) by searching through sets of known risk
    and protective factors through a sequence of exploring all bivariate
    associations.  Each sequence generates a set of more and more
    homogenous branches, with greater ability to identify individuals who
    are at greater risk than others within a given branch.  Comparisons are
    made with alternative predictive approaches including multiple
    regression, logistic regression and discriminant analysis.   The
    analyses provides insight into the role of specific protective and
    related risk factors, as well as, identifies clinically interesting
    subtypes of at-risk individuals.

    The idea that living in  bad neighborhoods intensifies the adverse
    consequences of poverty is an old one.  Recently, it has witnessed a
    resurgence of interest and  over the last 15 years social scientists have
    generated a large literature on neighborhood effect using observational
    studies.  Dissatisfaction with such studies as well as the evidence from
    quasi-experimental studies such as the Gatreaux program led to a greater
    interest in using randomized studies of residential mobility to estimate
    neighborhood effects.  This paper looks at the MTO demonstrations which have
    been generating a great deal of interest and many analyses, and examines in
    greater detail what we do and do not learn from these studies, and what
    policy implications these studies might or might not have.

    A central issue in the debate over the inequality of wage outcomes for
    young workers has been the source of the increasing cross-sectional
    polarization over
    time.  At one extreme, wages have simply become more volatile over time
    and, at the other, individual wage trajectories have diverged.  In the
    latter case, inequality persists over the life course.  We address this
    question by developing a class of latent curve models for longitudinal data
    that capture the underlying stochastic variation in a substantively
    interpretable manner.  The approach decomposes the variation into a small
    number of data-adaptive latent curves, which we call proto-splines. These
    curves represent the population-average features of the responses and allow
    individual-specific differences to be expressed via random coefficients of
    the population-average features.  By incorporating both types of features
    in a single modeling framework, we can make more definitive statements
    about the components of   wage inequality than can be obtained using
    traditional models.  Using these new models, we evaluate wage inequality in
    the context of the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men from 1979-94.

    Studies of development and change in partisan fortunes in
    the US emphasize epochs of partisan stability, separated by critical
    events or turning points. Yet to date we have no estimates of
    legislative regimes as they relate to electoral realignments. In this
    paper we study partisan balances in the US Congress using the method
    of Markov switching. Our estimates for the House of Representatives
    are based on election changes from 1854, roughly the date of the
    establishment of the modern incarnation of the two-party system, to
    the present. For the Senate, we estimate partisan balance from 1914,
    the date of popular election of Senators.

    We use this method to estimate an underlying unobserved state
    parameter, C+partisan regimeC-. Basically a partisan regime denotes a
    built-in congressional electoral advantage that persists through time,
    and that changes in a disjoint and episodic fashion. The method allows
    the direct estimation of critical transition points between Republican
    and Democratic partisan coalitions. Republican regimes characterized
    House elections during three periods: 1860 through 1872, 1894 through
    1906, and 1918 through 1928. A three-state estimate for the House
    suggested the emergence of a third state in 1994. For the Senate, the
    two-state model does not fit adequately. We estimate a three-state
    model in which a Republican regime dominated from 1914 through 1928; a
    Democratic regime characterized the period 1930-1934, and a
    Democratic-leaning regime characterized the period 1938 to the present
    (1936 is a transition year). Combined with existing historical
    evidence, our analysis isolates four critical congressional elections:
    1874; 1894; and 1930, and 1994.

    The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is one of the
    world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific journals.  PNAS
    publishes research reports in the Physical, Biological, and Social
    Sciences. The journal's official classification structure is reflected
    in topic labels submitted by the authors of manuscripts, largely
    related to traditionally established disciplines within the Physical,
    Biological, and Social Sciences.  Focusing on articles in the
    Biological Sciences, we explore their internal soft classification
    structure based only on semantic decompositions of abstracts and
    bibliographies, and compare it with the formal discipline
    classifications.Our hierarchical model assumes that there is a fixed
    number of internal categories, each characterized by multinomial
    distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in
    bibliographies). Soft classification for each article is based on
    proportions of the article's content coming from each category. Using
    eight internal categories in the model, we find that most traditional
    disciplines have major soft classification components in more than one
    internal category.

    Many of the recent statistical models for the analysis of dependence
    in social networks build on the general class of exponential random
    graphs, including Markov random graphs, "p-star" models, and
    actor-oriented models.b  In this talk we will examine how this class
    of models is related to the log-linear modeling framework used in
    earlier work to analyze mixing patterns in local network data.b  Both
    approaches are based on the exponential family; random graphs model
    the probability that two actors form a partnership given their
    attributes and the rest of the data, while log-linear approaches model
    the probability that two actors have specific attributes given that
    they form a partnership. Under saturated tie independence models the
    two probabilities are related via Bayes rule, and parameter values may
    be explicitly related. For unsaturated models, the two frameworks do
    not contain equivalent models, and the underlying differences reveal
    assumptions about social behavior within the two frameworks.b  It can
    be shown, however, that the two are expected to yield approximately
    equal fitted values in most practical applications.b  Understanding
    the relationship between the two modeling classes sheds light on the
    relationship between local and complete network data, and the role
    that models can play in bridging the traditional gap between them.

    challenges such as non-nested sources of clustering and endogenous
    covariates. Hierarchical models may not model contrasts of interest
    and may be difficult to fit or make unreasonable
    assumptions. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) require a large
    number of clusters, assume data are missing completely at random, and
    may be inefficient. We propose and compare two approaches for
    regression analysis of multilevel binary data when clusters are non
    necessarily nested: a GEE method that relies on a working independence
    assumption coupled with a three-step method for obtaining empirical
    standard errors and a likelihood-based method implemented using
    Bayesian computational techniques. Implications of covariate
    endogeneity are addressed. The methods are illustrated using data from
    the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium to estimate mammography
    accuracy from a repeatedly screened population.

    At least since the passage of the Voting Rights Act, an important
    component in evaluating any new legislative districting plan
    requires examining its likely impact on racial and ethnic
    minorities to fully participate in the electoral process.b The
    prevailing standard enshrined both in legal precedent and the
    statistical methods used to evaluate redistricting plans is
    outcome based: we ask is the minority group electorally cohesive
    and if so can they elect candidates of their choice under a give
    plan? We propose an alternative standard and statistical
    methodology that is opportunity based. That is, we ask does a
    redistricting plan treat voters of political relevant groups
    equally in terms of their ability to affect the electoral outcome?
    The metric of political influence we use is the probability that a
    voter is decisive in an election. We develop an estimator of this
    probability for voters of each of the relevant groups for a given
    plan from (aggregate) historical election data. We, then, provide
    some examples from actual redistricting cases.

    Interviewer effects, or variations in interviewee responses associated
    with interviewers, are not uncommon in survey research. Such effects
    tend to be more likely when interview questions are
    open-ended. Indeed, recent research showed moderate interviewer
    effects in the number of personal network members elicited, with
    intra-class correlations ranging between .13 and .15 after adjustment
    for numerous respondent and interviewer characteristics (Marsden,
    2003; van Tilburg, 1998). It is crucial that network elicitation be as
    complete as possible, because most network measures are very sensitive
    to missing data.Sexual and drug injection networks shape the
    transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, and other
    infections. The elicitation of sexual and drug injection partners
    involves open-ended questions that are of a sensitive nature, which
    may increase the likelihood of interviewer effects. Thus, in this
    project I am assessing the extent to which interviewer effects exist
    in the elicitation of such partners.The analyses are ongoing and
    involve multiple data sets from research studies and disease control
    activities. The results from the first two data sets suggest no
    interviewer effect on the number of partners elicited (intra-class

    In this article we evaluate the statistical evidence that a population
    of students learn about the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the
    centipede game via repeated play of the game. This is done by
    formulating a model in which a player's error in assessing the utility
    of game decisions changes as they gain experience with the game. We
    first estimate parameters in a statistical model where the
    probabilities of choices of the players are given by a Quantal
    Response Equilibrium (QRE) (McKelvey and Palfrey (1995, 1996, 1998)),
    but are allowed to change with repeated play. This model gives a
    better fit to the data than similar models previously considered.
    However, substantial correlation of outcomes of games having a common
    player suggests that a statistical model that captures within-subject
    correlation is more appropriate.  We estimate parameters in a model
    which allows for within-player correlation of decisions, and
    population-specific rates of learning.

    What is the impact of fiscal decentralization on the tax decisions of
    Russian regional authorities?  Russian federalism means, in practice,
    that central and regional officials co-occupy the same tax base.  Such
    shared tax bases create a common pool problem, with the tax levies of
    each level of government inducing responses by private producers that
    will impact the tax base of both. We present a study of the
    determinants of tax effort in Russia's regions, asking whether a
    rising federal tax rate is associated with a "crowding out" or a
    "crowding in" of regional tax effort.

    We first report results of estimating the tax effort model on a panel
    data set of Russia's regions, using pooled OLS, and then fixed
    effects, to deal with unobserved effects.  These results consistently
    show that a rising federal tax share is associated with increasing tax
    effort by regional officials.  However, with large geographical
    regions, the random sampling assumption in the cross section dimension
    of our panel is flawed.  We test for spatial autocorrelation and
    augment the previous economic model with spatial statistical methods.
    By combining economic and GIS data, we are able to add an intrinsic
    autoregressive error term  (Besag and Kooperberg, 1995) to our
    economic model and to estimate model coefficients via Bayesian methods
    and MCMC. The economic portion of the model identifies variables
    impacting tax effort, while the spatial component allows us to
    identify and account for regional heterogeneity and interaction among
    regions linked by proximity, trade links, and resource flows.
    Identification of spatial commonalities is an interesting outcome of
    the methodology, which suggests future research questions

    Central bankers' careers are shown to influence inflation
    outcomes.  I present two theories in which careers explain central
    bank behavior, develop them in a game theoretic model, and test
    them using a comprehensive new data set of central bankers'
    career backgrounds which spans twenty rich democracies and half a
    century.  Career experiences vary considerably over this sample,
    and not only mould beliefs about appropriate policy (the
    socialization hypothesis), but also shape career concerns for
    central bankers who seek career advancement in either the
    financial sector or government (the career incentives
    hypothesis). Accordingly, time series cross-section analysis of
    inflation shows central bankers with financial sector backgrounds
    preside over lower inflation, while central bankers with
    bureaucratic experience produce higher inflation.  The magnitude
    of career effects on inflation is on par with standard measures of
    central bank independence, and interactive models suggest both
    socialization and incentives contribute to these career effects.
    The study of central banks in particular and bureaucracy in
    general should pay greater attention to individual preferences and
    their interaction with organizations; institutions alone are not
    enough.

    account of the sense in which the laws and their logical consequences (but
    no accidents) possess a kind of "necessity." An analogous account applies
    to the logical necessities as well. I shall also examine in some detail
    how this account might apply to laws of a "special science." Were there
    such laws, they would possess a distinctive kind of necessity, and
    therefore figure in explanations that are irreducible to explanations of
    the same facts in terms of the fundamental laws of physics.

    Recent theoretical and empirical work in criminology supports the
    classification of individuals into groups, where the groups differ in
    trajectories of offending over time. Over the last
    three years we have employed growth-mixture modeling (semiparametric
    group-based modeling; Nagin, 1999) to identify and examine naturally
    occurring offense trajectories from childhood through adolescence and young
    adulthood (e.g., Chung, et al. 2002). In this presentation, I provide
    several illustrations of applications of this procedure in prevention
    research including: (1) static predictors of violence trajectories; (2) gang
    membership as a time-varying predictor of violence trajectories; and (3)
    trajectory-to-trajectory analysis: trajectories as predictors and outcomes.
    The sample is from the Seattle Social Development Project (J. David Hawkins,
    PI), a longitudinal panel study of 808 youth interviewed annually from 1985
    (age 10) to 1991 (age 16), and again in 1993 (age 18), 1996 (age 21), and
    1999 (age 24). The sample, which was selected to over-represent students
    from schools serving high crime neighborhoods, is gender-balanced,
    ethnically diverse, with high retention rates (95% of the still-living
    sample were interviewed at age 24). Analysis methods include semi-parametric
    group-based modeling for estimating developmental trajectories, examining
    the impact of a time-varying predictor, and examining transition
    probabilities between sets of trajectories, and multinomial logistic
    regression for examining the impact of static predictors on violence
    trajectory membership.

    Conversational social cyberspaces are repositories of messages organized
    into chains of turns and replies. These spaces are among the most
    popular aspects of online usage. Online conversation spaces like email
    lists, newsgroups, and web boards, are rich social environments that are
    increasingly important spaces for civic discourse. Most conversational
    social cyberspaces suffer from the problem of "too much" and are
    vulnerable to disruption by a small minority. Sociological studies of
    these spaces are hampered by the limits of existing tools and
    interfaces. Social cyberspaces are in their early development and still
    lack many elements of the infrastructure of physical interaction spaces.

    Information about basic social properties of online environments, their
    size, activity, and composition of their populations, for example, are
    entirely missing or difficult to construct with existing tools. Mutual
    awareness is a necessary component of most social institutions. In its
    absence many social cyberspaces become noisy conflictual spaces of
    limited value. Tools for navigating and evaluating the content found in
    social cyberspaces that are based on the analysis of social history can
    help support social institutions by encouraging accountability and
    highlighting the future value of identity and reputation. Built on
    mutual awareness, the resulting institutions may be more resistant to
    invasion and disruption. These tools serve the additional function of
    providing analysts with empirical data that covers a broad scope of
    social cyberspaces, allowing the formation of maps and measures that can
    answer basic questions about the dynamics, structure and variation of
    these novel interaction environments.

    In this paper we consider the analysis of semiparametric models for binary
    panel data with state dependence. A hierarchical modeling approach is used
    for dealing with the initial conditions problem, for addressing
    heterogeneity, and for incorporating correlation between the covariates and
    the random effects. We consider a semiparametric model in which a Markov
    process prior is used to model an unknown regression function. Estimation is
    done by computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that
    exploit the underlying latent structure of binary data models, following
    Albert and Chib (1993). Simulation results suggest that the method performs
    well. In addition to estimation, we address the problem of model selection
    which is a key concern when dealing with a multitude of possible
    specifications. Moreover, we present a framework for calculating the average
    covariate effects, which deals with the nonlinearity and dynamic structure
    of the model. The techniques of this paper are applied to modeling of the
    intertemporal labor force participation decisions of a panel of 1545 married
    women. In this application, the data support a semiparametric model with
    multiple sources of heterogeneity and multi-lag state dependence.

    A class of statistical models is proposed which aims at estimating latent
    transitive structures in networks. Such structures can be used e.g. to
    identify close-knit subsets of actors in large social networks (with up to
    several hundred actors). The measurement model can be sketched as follows.
    Given one observed network, it is assumed that this observed network was
    generated by latent transitive structures. The latent transitive
    structures are expressed by ultrametrics. It is assumed that the
    probability of observing an edge increases with decreasing ultrametric
    distance. To make statistical inference, the Maximum Likelihood principle
    as well as Bayesian methods are applied. The Maximum Likelihood principle
    is implemented using some non-greedy optimization algorithm, while
    Bayesian inference is implemented using a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo
    algorithm. Applications will be presented.

    Goodness-of-fit tests are useful as an exploratory tool in identifying
    parsimonious statistical descriptions of datasets. Ordinary Monte Carlo
    tests produce exact p-values for any choice of test statistics in any
    non-parametric formulation from which random samples can be generated;
    and parametric formulations can often be transformed into non-parametric
    ones by appropriate conditioning. When direct simulation is not feasible,
    it can be replaced by Markov chain Monte Carlo and, surprisingly, the
    exactness of the p-value can be maintained. The talk will describe both
    types of procedure, illustrated by applications in the social sciences.
    Examples will include sparse contingency tables in two or more dimensions,
    for which standard chi-squared theory is no longer appropriate, the Rasch
    model in educational testing and in the struggle for existence (Darwin's

    Most inference for models for social networks assumes that the
    presence or absence of all links in the network are completely
    observed, that the information is completely reliable and there
    are no measurement (e.g.  recording) errors. This is clearly not
    true in practice, as the majority of network data is collected
    though sample surveys. In addition even if a census of a
    population is attempted, individuals and links between individuals
    are missed (i.e., do not appear in the recorded data).

    In this talk we develop the conceptual and computational theory for inference
    based on sampled network information. We first review forms of network sampling
    designs used in practice and consider the various forms of out-of-design
    missing data. We consider inference from the likelihood framework, and develop
    a typology of network data that reflects their treatment within this frame.  We
    then develop inference for social network models based on information from
    adaptive network mechanisms.

    An implementation and evaluation is presented of Andrews (1999)
    method for statistical inference for models with restricted
    parameters.  This method produces confidence limits by
    encapsulating the distorted acceptance region with a regular
    hyper-ellipsoid and simulating a distribution of the
    parameters within it.

    From 1969 when quasi-Newton methods were first implemented for
    maximum likelihood estimation restricted parameter spaces
    presented difficulties for both the optimization and
    statistical inference. Nonlinear programming methods introduce
    in the 90's solved the optimization problem and now the Andrews
    method purports to solve the inference problem.

    The presentation will include an overview of optimization and
    maximum likelihood methods from 1969 through the present time
    and will conclude with results of simulations of the different
    methods commonly used for statistical inference in addition to
    the Andrews method.

    Ecological regression studies in which an aggregate level response is
    regressed upon an aggregate level predictor, are a dangerous enterprise
    since relationships at the level of the group only agree with
    relationships at the level of the individual under very strict
    circumstances. This can lead to the possibility of the so-called
    ecological fallacy which occurs because of within-group variability in
    exposures and confounders. Usual biases in individual observational
    studies are far more complicated in an ecological setting, and there are
    additional biases that are unique to ecological studies. In this talk I
    will describe the various types of bias and characterize the direction and
    magnitude in a number of situations. Examples from spatial epidemiology
    will be presented, in particular the association between cancer incidence
    and socio-economic variables.

    I am interested in knowing how key aspects of sexual partnerships
    influence risk of acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted
    diseases (STD). There are a number of approaches to this question, ranging
    from standard epidemiologic models of risk in which partnership
    characteristics are included in a regression model as covariates, to
    complex, nonlinear epidemic models of disease in which sexual partnerships
    must somehow be parameterized. In this talk I will discuss some of the key
    characteristics of sexual partnerships (such as duration and intensity),
    describe some of the difficult issues one faces in trying to estimate
    these characteristics from real(istic) data and suggest some possible
    approaches to modeling sexual partnerships that might be useful to those
    creating epidemic models of STD. This talk represents work in progress. I

    Intonation is the meaningful melody of spoken language. Consider, for
    example, the contrasting melodies in the following two sentences: "What
    do you want?" and, "Do you want tea?" In English, intonation marks
    phrase and clause boundaries; sentence types, e.g., yes-no questions
    vs. statements; topic focus; and new vs. old information. In spite of
    how important intonation is for conveying meaning and its apparent
    universality in language, there is no generally accepted approach for
    investigating the intonational structure of a language.

    The recent development of computerized instruments now allows
    researchers to measure the acoustic properties of recorded speech,
    including the fundamental pitch (f0), which is the number of vocal cord
    vibrations per second. Many variables affect f0 that are neither
    syntactic nor semantic, including individual speaker variation and the
    physical limitations of the human vocal system. To avoid these effects,
    many researchers, relying on expert judgment, select individual f0
    measurements on which to base their analyses. In contrast we use all
    the f0 measurements. Our goal is to explicitly model and adjust for
    these nuisance variables, teasing out the intonational signal.

    We approach intonation as a relationship between f0 and a set of
    explanatory variables related to syntax and semantics. Our task is to
    measure the syntactic and semantic effects on f0 in the presence of the
    other variables affecting f0. Our data consist of recordings from 16
    speakers of two dialects of Unungam Tunuu (Aleut), an endangered
    Alaskan language and member of the Eskimo/Aleut language family. It is
    predicted that within one generation, 50% of the world's 6000+
    languages will be gone. Thus, at this time it is crucial to gain a
    deeper understanding of these languages--both for linguists, who study
    the scope and parameters of the human language faculty, and for small
    language communities, who want to preserve knowledge for future
    language learning.

    Our work has appeared in the Journal of Phonetics (2001) and at
    conferences of the Linguistic Society of America and the Acoustical
    Society of America.

    Theoretical and empirical models often ignore the
    interdependencies among the actors and actions that comprise world
    politics at the same time they seek to understand it. As a result
    Virtually all extant, empirical work proceeds by assuming the
    absence of any interdependencies among the actors and
    interactions. Yet, absent dependencies, these data would not
    interesting from a world politics perspective. As a way of
    addressing some of these important dependencies in the network of
    interactions world politics, we use a latent space approach
    (Hoff, Raftery, Handcock, 2002).

    Specifically, we estimate the number of political interactions
    among a wide range of Central Asian political actors using a
    latent space approach applied to a large sample of 36,000 event
    data. We show that this approach captures important dynamics among
    the data and extends well beyond propinquity explanations
    (Tobler's Law) of the sources interaction by constructing latent
    positions of each actor in an unmeasured social "space." We also
    show that this approach provides a  framework within which missing
    network data may be usefully and accurately imputed.

    Current thinking in medical decision making and health policy
    analysis is strongly influenced by the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY)
    utility model.  This model can be used to assign subjective values to
    health outcomes for purposes of evaluating the overall worth (expected
    utility) of alternative risky decisions or policies.  More recently, a
    fundamentally different approach has been proposed that attempts to
    quantify the relative worth of health outcomes in terms of hypothetical
    social impacts.  This approach, called Person Tradeoff (PTO) measurement,
    is based on the following PTO judgment task.  Suppose we wish to compare
    the worth of an intervention that potentially saves lives to one that
    potentially improves hearing.  In particular, suppose that Intervention A
    could save the lives of 100 people chosen at random from our society;
    suppose that Intervention B could completely restore the hearing of X
    people also chosen at random who would otherwise be deaf.  The PTO
    judgment task asks:  How large would X have to be in order for
    Interventions A and B to be equally desirable?  If the average response in
    a large sample of subjects is that restoring X = 6,000 deafnesses to full
    hearing is equally desirable as 100 deaths averted, one might infer that
    restoration of hearing is worth 100/6000 = .017 the worth of saving a
    life.  I will refer to this number, .017, as the PTO ratio for restoration
    of hearing on a scale that spans "death" to "full health."  (Of course,
    the questions have to be explained more carefully in order to be
    meaningful.)  By pursuing similar questions for a variety of health state
    changes, one could determine PTO ratios for many different health state
    changes.  The Norwegian health economist, Eric Nord, has argued that PTO
    ratios should be used as a measure of health state utility because PTO
    ratios take into account preferences for fairness and equitable
    distributions as well as personal preferences for health.

    In this talk, I will report work in collaboration with Jason Doctor
    (UW Department of Medical Education) on an axiomatic foundations for PTO
    measurement, and work with Michael Perry (UW Psychology) on testing PTO
    axioms.  Although the specific assumptions differ from those of the QALY
    model, the axiomatic analysis plays an analogous role in theory
    construction and testing.  An axiomatic analysis of PTO measurement
    identifies behavioral assumptions that are jointly sufficient for the PTO
    representation.  It is theoretically desirable that one should formulate
    assumptions that are necessary for the representation, to the extent that
    this is possible.  Although this talk will have mathematical aspects to
    it, it will not focus on the mathematical problem of axiomatization and
    proof of a PTO representation theorem.  Rather the talk will focus on (a)
    the role of axiomatic behavioral theories in social science theory
    construction; (b) the problem of testing critical assumptions of the PTO
    representation in behavioral experiments; (c) some preliminary data on
    tests of axioms will be discussed.

    It is now well known that standard asymptotic inference techniques
    for instrumental variable estimation perform very poorly in the
    presence of weak instruments. Specifically, standard asymptotic
    techniques give spuriously small standard errors, leading
    investigators to apparently tight confidence regions which may be
    very far from the true parameter of interest. While much research
    has been done on inference in models with one right-hand-side
    endogenous variable, not much is known about inference on
    individual coefficients in models with multiple right-hand-side
    endogenous variables.  In this paper we systematically investigate
    inference on individual structural coefficients in instrumental
    variables regression models with multiple right-hand-side
    endogenous variables. We focus on the cases where instruments may
    be weak for all coefficients or only for a subset of
    coefficients. We evaluate existing techniques for performing
    inference on individual coefficients using Staiger and Stock's
    weak instrument asymptotics, and perform extensive finite sample
    analyses using Monte Carlo simulations.

    Fearon and Laitin (2003) have published an important recent
    article challenging the conventional wisdom that the root cause of
    most civil wars lies in ethnic and religious diversity. Instead,
    they argue that state strength is the primary predictor of civil
    war onset. There are two reasons to believe that measurement error
    might complicate Fearon and Laitin's findings. First, the
    theoretical story that Fearon and Laitin tell revolves around a
    latent -that is, unmeasured - variable we term "state strength."
    In their story, the risk of insurgency increases as the capacity
    of the state decreases. Despite the centrality of this latent
    variable to their analysis, Fearon and Laitin do not posit a
    rigorous model relating the observed indicators to the underlying
    concept of state capacity. Second, as much past literature
    suggests, the indicators of ethnic and religious diversity used in
    the analysis are all measured with considerable error. From a
    statistical perspective, these two issues both pose the problem of
    measurement error. In general, it is both possible (and
    empirically common) for measurement error in multiple predictor
    variables to bias coefficients in unknown directions (possibly
    changing the signs of coefficients). Furthermore, maximum
    likelihood estimators are no longer consistent in the presence of
    covariate measurement error. We use the same data as Fearon and
    Laitin to estimate models of the determinants of civil war onset
    with one principal difference: our models take into account
    measurement error in the independent variables.

    Many job markets can be characterized as two-sided matching markets,
    where hiring outcomes result from the intersection of two "quality sorts"
    between applicants and hiring organizations.  While economists have
    detailed how these markets clear with respect to individual preferences,
    sociologists have tended to focus on the non-market features that
    stratify organizations or bias employment.  This paper uses a simulation
    model of academic job markets to bridge these two literatures by asking
    (a) whether stable quality rankings emerge naturally within such markets,
    (b) how variation in agreement on applicant/organizational quality shapes
    market outcomes, and (c) whether (and under what conditions) an
    organizational caste system (Burris ASR 2004) might emerge.  While this
    project is in the early working stages, preliminary results suggest that
    net of simple supply and demand features that shape market size, the
    extent to which organizations agree on applicant quality is a primary
    determinant of market outcomes.  Resulting quality rankings tend to be
    very stable under most conditions, but employment exchange structures
    consistent with an organizational caste system emerge most frequently
    when there is a strong correlation between student and department
    quality.

    Digraph panel data (directed edges between vertices observed at two or
    more time points) arise in the social sciences and other fields of

    The talk discusses a general framework for the analysis of survey
    data with missing observations. The approach presented here
    considers missing data an unavoidable feature of any survey of the
    human population and aims at taking the unobserved part of the
    data into account when assessing model fit. To handle coverage
    error and unit nonresponse, the true distribution is modeled as a
    mixture of an observable and of an unobservable component. To
    assess model fit in this context, the mixture index of fit is
    used. The mixture index of fit does not postulate that the model
    of interest may account for the entire population, rather it
    considers the true distribution as a mixture of a component where
    the model fits and of another one where the model does not
    fit. The fit of the model with missing data taken into account is
    assessed by equating these two mixtures, one describing the
    observational process and the other one representing model fit,
    and asking, for different rates of missing observations, what is
    the largest fraction of the population where the model may hold
    true. In this framework the talk proposes a diagnostic procedure
    and illustrates its application to survey data.

    Using the April 2001 Cincinnati riot as a natural experiment, this
    paper examines police officers' response to a sudden change in
    their evaluation mechanism, i.e., the sharply increased media
    attention and the ensuing federal investigation. This heightened
    police officers' fear of being accused of "racial profiling". I
    find that during the remaining months of 2001, (i)
    arrests for crimes and citations for traffic violations decreased
    substantially, (ii) the decrease was more significant for offenses
    where police officers had more discretion, and (iii) the decrease in
    misdemeanor arrests was greater in communities with a higher
    percentage of African Americans. Monthly felonies (violent crimes and
    property crimes) surged during the same period. This evidence suggests
    that police officers responded through less aggressive policing when
    the evaluation mechanism tilted toward "consumer complaints",
    lending support to predictions of Prendergast (2003).

    This paper develops a general framework for conducting local
    robustness analysis.  By local robustness, we refer to the calculation
    of control solutions that are determined by the least
    favorable model within a set of possible models that are, along a
    certain metric, close to an initial core model.  We provide Nash and
    Stackelberg equilibrium characterizations of the choice of control in
    such contexts. We then apply this abstract formulation to the analysis
    of how a desire for robustness influences the choice of control for
    discrete time control problems of the type often found in
    macroeconomics.  This analysis is conducted using frequency domain
    methods and is shown to involve certain fundamental limits to the
    efficacy of controls in such environments.  Finally, we use these
    methods to identify some implications for the robust design of
    monetary policy. This work is joint with William A. Brock, University of Wisconsin.

    Tens of thousands of individuals undergo polygraph security

    suitable alternatives to the polygraph for security screening?

    This analysis considers how racial segregation affects mixed-race
    household residential choice.  We focus on the mixed-race household
    because such households constitute a scale at which mixed-race contact
    takes place and a site for identity construction of individuals,
    partners, and the surrounding neighborhood.  We find that a) race, in
    tandem with status markers like income, and b) nativity, provide some
    of the best understandings of these neighborhood geographies. In
    addition, the study finds that instead of fitting into and thus
    reinforcing the existing racialized spatial structure of the city,
    some mixed-race households live in spaces that defy easy
    categorization.

    This paper uses the concept of correlated equilibrium to make
    statistical predictions directly from a standard strategic form game.
    This paper finds a simple technique for placing bounds on the
    covariance of people's actions in all correlated equilibria of a game.
    In a "generic" $2\times 2$ game, for example, one can predict the
    sign of the covariance of people's actions.  This paper also considers
    the question of identification: given observations, what games are
    consistent with these observations.  For $2\times 2$ games, for
    example, a signed covariance in people's actions is sufficient to
    identify pure strategy Nash equilibria of the game.  An application to
    spatial data analysis is also discussed.'

    As one of 11 Teachers for a New Era (TNE) sites around the country
    funded by the Carnegie Foundation in collaboration with other
    foundations, the UW will need to draw on its best thinking to
    establish a system for evaluating the performance of graduates who
    teach in P-12 schools. The system must include evidence of P- 12
    student learning.

    The TNE project is in part a response to a long-standing
    controversy about the contribution of university-based teacher
    education to teachers' effectiveness, as measured by students'
    standardized achievement test scores. Creating a data system on
    teacher-graduates' performance is also critical to inform UW
    programs on how to improve the preparation of teachers. This talk
    will explore some of the issues, concerns, and models for
    determining the effects of university-based preparation on teacher
    performance and solicit ideas for how to build such a data system.

    For over half a century biologists have investigated departures from
    perfect symmetry in organisms as a means to explore the nature of
    biological development and effects of stresses on developmental stability.
    More recently (and more contentiously), morphological symmetry has been
    hypothesized to be an important signal of quality used in social
    interactions such as mate selection.  Current approaches for quantifying
    asymmetries depend almost entirely on "fluctuating asymmetry" (FA),
    defined as the distribution of differences between bilateral traits.  FA
    has a number of well-known problems, however.  We propose a new approach
    based on estimating (1) a latent distribution for the underlying trait,
    and (2) a distribution of developmental noise that is superimposed on the
    trait in the expression of each side.  The method yields maximum
    likelihood estimates for the parameters of both distributions.
    Extensions of the method allow for simultaneous estimation of other types
    of anymmetries (directional asymmetry and antisymmetry), as well as the
    means to quantify covariate effects on different components of the model.
    The new method is explored using morphological and chronometric traits.

    In traditional educational and intelligence tests examinees'
    answers are either right or wrong. The same is true in many other
    rating systems. For example, various political activist groups
    will rate legislators as voting for the "hawk" vs. "dove"
    position, or pro-environmentalist vs. pro-business. We are
    investigating an alternative technique, in which multiple
    responses to the same item can be rated as being associated with
    various positions, or underlying ideas called facets, without a
    necessary implication that ideas are right or wrong. Although this
    scoring system has several educational advantages, it does not
    lend itself to conventional psychometric applications. We will
    describe a newly developed psychometric approach. The application
    will be illustrated with examples in which high school and middle
    school students respond to material taught in the physical science
    curriculum. We discuss the relation of our approach to the
    conventional and to another alternative.

    This paper uses social network and spatial data from the National
    Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and data on school
    district segregation from the National Center for Educational Statistics
    (NCES) to estimate the effect of racial residential segregation on school
    friendship segregation in the U.S.  Within school residential segregation
    is measured by the spatial distance between potential friends in the Add
    Health data, and levels of across-school segregation are calculated from
    the NCES data.  The use of hierarchical linear models (HLM) allows us to
    simultaneously estimate the effect of race, within-school spatial
    segregation, and school-level racial heterogeneity on friendship choice
    using the Add Health data.  We use these results to predict the decline in
    friendship segregation that would occur if across- and within-school
    residential segregation were eliminated in U.S. metropolitan areas using
    the NCES data.  The results suggest that about a third of the level of
    racial friendship segregation in schools is attributable to residential
    segregation.  Importantly, however, we find that almost all of this effect
    is due to geographic segregation across schools rather than spatial
    segregation within schools.

    It is well known that the shape of the distribution of age at first
    marriage shows strong regularities across many countries and recent
    historical periods. We account for these patterns by developing
    agent-based models that simulate the aggregate behavior of individuals
    searching for marriage partners. Past models assumed fully rational
    agents with complete knowledge of the marriage market; our simulated
    agents use psychologically plausible simple heuristic search rules
    that adjust aspiration levels on the basis of a sequence of encounters
    with potential partners. Substantial individual variation must be
    included in the models to account for the demographically observed
    age-at-marriage patterns.

    Using the 1990 PUMS data, we examine segregation across 500
    detailed occupations on the basis of workers' race, ethnic
    ancestry, and Hispanic origin, as well as their sex. Our previous
    work on this topic used multidimensional scaling to analyze
    indices of dissimilarity among all employed workers categorized
    into 60 sex-race-ethnic-Hispanicity groups. That work adjusted for
    non-zero floor effects on the index of dissimilarity due to small
    sample sizes, but treated all of the resulting adjusted index
    values as equally reliable, even though there is substantial
    variation in the sizes of the 60 groups. In this paper we assess
    the uncertainty in groups' positions in latent space models of
    occupational segregation. We use two general approaches to do
    this: (1) simulation of variation in group positions based on a
    probabilistic model that conditions on group size and (2) a mixed
    effects model developed by Hoff (2003) that captures dependence
    patterns in dyadic data sets. The latter model also allows us to
    determine the extent to which group-level covariates influence
    groups' positions in the latent space representing occupational
    segregation.

    Health status at the turn of the century varies widely across nations.
    To elucidate policies that can have a real impact on improving health
    outcomes such as life expectancy and child mortality is of particular
    interest to many researchers and decision makers.  Our study builds on
    and extends beyond existing literature in the range of conditions
    considered as well as in the statistical procedures used to derive
    explanatory models. In fact we address the problem from a health
    ecology perspective, since many factors, such as demographics,
    economics, politics, education, and culture, are believed to influence
    health. Our study includes 161 countries representing all possible
    economical and demographical conditions in the world, and thus is not
    limited to only affluent nations as most previous studies are.

    We gathered data from several reliable sources, and encountered large
    amounts of missing data. We dealt with this problem using multiple
    imputation techniques. Each imputed data set was derived through
    hierarchical multivariate means models. These models appear adequate
    since countries are naturally grouped by economic and
    geographical-cultural conditions.

    Three country groups were derived in the health outcome (life
    expectancy/child mortality) space. At the two extremes of health
    outcomes are a group consisting of mostly sub-Saharan African
    countries, and a group of mostly affluent countries. The three groups
    are reflected and also detected in demographics (death rate/population
    dependency) space. This finding hints a tight relationship between
    health outcomes and demographics conditions. The extend of this
    relation, as well as the strength of the relationship between other
    factors such as economics, education, and health performance, and
    health outcomes, was confirmed through Bayesian hierarchical multiple
    linear regression models.

    I will give an overview of the interdisciplinary project "Integration
    and
    visualization of multisource information for mesoscale meteorology: Statistical
    and cognitive approaches to visualizing uncertainty," which brings together
    atmospheric scientists, psychologists and statisticians at the University of
    Washington. The goals of the project are the development of statistical methods
    for probabilistic weather forecasting, ways of visualizing and communicating
    such probabilistic statements, and tools for users to implement the methods.

    The state of the atmosphere is very complex, and is often represented by 10
    million numbers or so. We are interested in a further degree of complexity:
    statements of uncertainty about future values of this very high-dimensional
    quantity. How to present and communicate such uncertainty is only partly a
    statistical problem; it is also, and perhaps mainly, a cognitive problem. It is
    complicated by the fact that users such as weather forecasters for the media,
    shipping or aviation work under intense time pressure with many interruptions,
    and already suffer from information overload; if the information is not well
    presented, they simply won't use it. Led by the psychologists, our group is
    addressing this by ethnographic field study of how forecasters actually use
    information and of the social structure of forecasting operations, and by
    cognitive experiments assessing the use of probabilistic information and
    different ways of displaying it. Results about effective ways to display
    complex probabilistic information could be useful for quantitative researchers
    more generally. I will outline some experiments that are currently
    under way to assess various ways of communicating uncertainty.

    In this talk, I will consider in more detail the first goal of the project: the
    problem of calibrated and sharp probabilistic forecasting of a future
    meteorological quantity. By calibrated, we mean that if we define a predictive
    interval, such as a 90% probability interval, then on average in the long run,
    90% of such intervals contain the true value. By "sharp," we mean that the
    distribution is more concentrated than forecast distributions from climatology
    (i.e. the marginal distribution) alone. UW Atmospheric Science Professor Cliff
    Mass and his group have developed an ensemble forecasting system for the
    Pacific Northwest based on a set of weather forecasting deterministic
    simulation models. He has established a clear relationship between
    between-model variability and forecast errors, but his forecast intervals are
    generally not calibrated; they are too narrow. This seems contradictory at
    first sight. We apply Bayesian model averaging to develop probability forecasts
    using Mass's ensemble. The theory of Bayesian model averaging explains both of
    Mass's main empirical findings: the spread-error relationship, and the fact
    that the intervals from the Mass ensemble are too narrow on average. We develop
    Bayesian model averaging forecasts and apply them to forecasts of sea-level
    pressure in the Pacific Northwest. The resulting forecasts are calibrated and
    sharp.

    Despite the increased visibility of Latino and Asian Americans across

    Specification tests are designed to assess the validity of
    the assumptions underlying the model being estimated before the model
    can be considered as adequate. Common examples of specification tests
    include White's IM test, Ramsey's RESET test, and the Hausman-McFadden
    test of IIA for multinomial logit. In practice, it is tempting for a
    data analyst to use such tests as part of a specification search. If
    the hypothesis being tested is not rejected, estimates of the current
    specification are used; if the hypothesis is rejected, the model is
    re-specified to address the failing suggested by the test. In the
    paper, I present a series of Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the
    broad limitations of specification tests. These include: 1) results
    that are highly sensitive to what are essentially arbitrary decisions
    in constructing the test; 2) sensitivity of tests to violations of
    assumptions other than those explicitly being tested; 3) poor size
    properties even in large samples; 4) size properties that are highly
    dependent upon characteristics of the data rather than violations of
    the assumptions being tested; and 5) poor properties when tests are
    used for screening, with the final model modified based on the prior
    screening. Overall, the results suggest that using specification tests
    to select a final model often lead to more problems than solutions.

    The author introduces and argues for a new standard for justifiable
    paternalism, the Most Reliable Judgment Standard.  According to the
    Most Reliable Judgment Standard, a person's hypothetical future
    judgments about paternalistic intervention can be used to justify
    paternalistic intervention in that person's present choices.  Often,
    people's current judgments are the most reliable predictor of their
    future judgments; but not always.  In some cases statistical data on
    how people's judgments have changed over time provide a more reliable
    predictor of an individual's future judgments.  The author considers
    how statistical evidence on attitudes toward suicide intervention,
    drug prohibitions, and forced medical care could be used to determine
    which can be justified on paternalistic grounds.  Because relevant
    statistical evidence is lacking in many cases, the author concludes
    with suggestions for further research.

    Building on work of McKPal 95, McKPal 96, McKPal 98 and Sig 99 on
    quantal response equilibrium models and  NewCzaCha 96, IshZar 00,
    IshJam 01and IshZar 02, on semiparametric Bayesian methods, we develop
    Bayesian inference for a particular class of semiparametric strategic
    choice models. Unlike previous approaches that have assumed the
    disturbances entering into actors' random utility functions follow a
    particular, known distribution such as a Gaussian distribution or a
    type I extreme value distribution, we instead assume only that the
    differenced disturbances have a right-continuous distribution function
    with fixed median and interquartile range. We model such a random
    distribution function using an approximation to the centrally
    standardized Dirichlet process prior of NewCzaCha 96. Model fitting is
    accomplished via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We present results from
    Monte Carlo experiments and a simulated data example. Our Monte Carlo
    results show that incorrectly specifying the distribution of the
    actors' utility disturbances within a parametric model can
    dramatrically bias quantities of interest such as the conditional
    expectation function and fitted probabilities. Our simulated data
    example demonstrates that our semiparametric approach works well on a
    difficult example in which the underlying true distribution function
    of the differenced disturbances is highly skewed.

- abstract: >-

    In a predictive model, what is the expected change in the outcome
    associated with a unit change in one of the inputs? In a linear
    regression model without interactions, this "average predictive
    effect" is simply a regression coefficient (with associated
    uncertainty). In a model with nonlinearity or interactions, however,
    the average predictive effect in general depends on the values of the
    predictors. We consider various definitions based on averages over a
    population distribution of the predictors, and we compute standard
    errors based on uncertainty in model parameters. We illustrate with a
    study of criminal justice data for urban counties in the United
    States.  The outcome of interest measures whether a convicted felon
    received a prison sentence rather than a jail or non-custodial
    sentence, with predictors available at both individual and county
    levels. We fit three models: a hierarchical logistic regression with
    varying coefficients for the within-county intercepts as well as for
    each individual predictor; a hierarchical model with varying
    intercepts only; and a non-hierarchical model that ignores the
    multilevel nature of the data. The regression coefficients have
    different interpretations for the different models; in contrast, the
    models can be compared directly using predictive effects.
    Furthermore, predictive effects clarify the interplay between the
    individual and county predictors for the hierarchical models, as well
    as illustrating the relative size of varying county effects.

    A plausible representation of the relational information among entities
    in dynamic systems such as a social community or a living cell is a stochastic
    network that is topologically rewiring and semantically evolving over time. While
    there is a rich literature in modeling static or temporally invariant networks,
    until recently, little has been done toward modeling the dynamic processes underlying
    rewiring networks, and on recovering such networks when they are not observable.
    In this talk, I will present a new formalism for modeling network evolution over
    time based on temporal exponential random graphs, and several new algorithms for
    estimating the structure of time evolving probabilistic graphical models underlying
    nonstationary time-series of nodal attributes. I will show some promising results
    on recovering the latent sequence of evolving social networks in the US Senate
    based it voting history, and the gene networks over more than 4000 genes during
    the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster from microarray time course, at a time
    resolution only limited by sample frequency. I will also sketch some theoretical
    results on the asymptotic sparsistency of the proposed methods, which differ significantly
    from traditional sparsistency analysis of static structure estimation based on
    iid samples because of the temporal relatedness of samples. If time permits, I
    will also report a hierarchical Bayesian model for estimating and visualizing
    the trajectories of latent mixed-membership nodal states in the recovered evolving
    networks.

    Joint work with Victor Shih (Department of Political Science, Northwestern
    University) and Mingzing Liu (China Institute for Educational Finance Research,
    Peking University)

    Are authoritarian leaders mainly preoccupied with promoting regime-wide interests
    or with maintaining power vis-a-vis other leaders? In this paper, we show that
    even a relatively institutionalized and homogeneous regime like China is simultaneously
    preoccupied with meritocratic and clientelistic considerations. We make use of
    a new biographical database of Central Committee (CC) members and a previously
    overlooked feature of CCP reporting to test hypotheses about how Communist Party
    elite were ranked throughout the reform period. We analyze these data with a novel
    multi-level Bayesian model of ranks that can estimate individual-level correlates
    of ranks that are only partially observed. We find that educational qualifications
    and provincial revenue collection played substantial roles in elite ranking in
    the reform era, while provincial economic growth did not. Factional ties with
    various top leaders and princeling status helped officials climb higher in the
    CCP elite throughout the reform period. Going beyond simple labels of the CCP
    regime as ?meritocratic? or ?clientelistic,? our findings suggest that both regime
    strengthening tendencies and elite rivalries drove political advancement.

    This talk is sponsored in part by the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS). 

    The study of the influence of environmental and socio-economic
    risk factors on health often requires the use of multiple data
    sources, such as small-area aggregated data, routinely collected
    administrative data as well as data coming from surveys and cohort
    studies. Some data sources will contain detailed information on a
    small sample of individuals; in contrast, others will have a
    limited number of variables for the whole population. Building
    models that can link various sources of data presents a number of
    challenges, for example dealing with model mis-specification and
    ecological bias, or having to impute missing confounders.

    Bayesian graphical models provide a coherent way to connect a
    series of local sub-models based on different datasets into a
    global unified analysis. In particular, hierarchically related
    regression (HRR) models can be built to carry out simultaneous
    regression on aggregated and individual level data, control
    ecological bias and study the relative contribution of contextual
    and individual level risk factors. In a similar manner, Bayesian
    graphical models can be used to fit a common regression model to a
    combination of data sets with different sets of covariates,
    correctly propagating information between the model components.

    We will discuss the application of Bayesian graphical models in
    different contexts. In the first one, the aim is to use these to
    help separate the effects of place of residence and personal
    circumstances on two contrasting health outcomes: perceived
    "limiting long-term illness" and hospitalization for
    cardiovascular disease. The second example is concerned with a
    case study on the effect of water disinfection by-products on low
    birth weight in the U.K, where the analysis uses a combination of
    register, survey and small area data.

    Propensity score matching aims to gain for an observational study various
    benefits characteristic of experiments, only some of which can be directly observed.
    If it is successful in those of its aims that are observable, this suggests it
    has succeeded in the remaining ones: we cite visible successes as evidence of
    likely success elsewhere. Yet existing theory pertinent to matching supports such
    connections only vaguely. It seems to require exact matching on the true propensity
    score, even in the absence of hidden bias. In practice, the best one can do is
    to match approximately, and on estimated scores.

    There are at least two problems with this state of affairs. First, there is confusion
    about how best to match: Must one match as closely as is possible on the best
    estimate of the propensity score? What precisely is the role of balance, and how
    much of it does one need? Second, we are without a basis for inference with propensity-matched
    data that requires neither the addition of a model of the data generating process
    nor the pretense of exact propensity score matching.

    This paper develops a novel large sample account of permutation-type causal inferences
    with propensity-matched data. Rather than relying on a specific estimation or
    matching technique, it puts the more nearly verifiable of propensity matching's
    aims in a central role, thus clarifying their contributions to the integrity of
    inferences about treatment effects.

    The challenges of conducting cohort analysis are well known. Whether
    any observed time-related differences from data are related to aging or cohort
    variation or historical time is a question usually deemed conceptually important
    but empirically intractable. What should one do to model these effects to understand
    the social and biological mechanisms generating the data? I aim to provide some
    useful guidelines on how to conduct cohort analysis. I first summarize the state
    of knowledge on cohort analysis in sociology, demography, and epidemiology. I
    then provide a synthesis of new developments, including models, methods, and substantive
    applications, for three commonly used research designs: 1) age-by-period tables
    of rates; 2) repeated cross-sectional surveys; and 3) accelerated longitudinal

    Moving into adulthood is associated with the adoption of new roles and
    statuses. Completing school, moving into full-time employment, getting
    married, and becoming a parent are key transitions in young adulthood. Young
    people differ in the sequencing, timing, and completion of these
    transitions, resulting in different configurations of roles. Over time,
    these configurations form distinct pathways. It is difficult to analyze
    pathways in their complex developmental nature and take into account that
    transitions in different domains are interdependent across time. Using a
    longitudinal extension of latent class analysis we analyzed configurations
    of statuses and adult roles (including student status, employment, marriage,
    and parenthood) from ages 18 to 30 in a panel of 808 contemporary young
    adults from the Seattle Social Development Project. Results suggest that
    three latent pathways describe the transition to adulthood for both men and
    women but that the nature of these pathways differed by gender. Furthermore,
    little is known about the implications of different pathways to adulthood
    for later adult functioning. If pathways to adulthood are uniquely related
    to later adult functioning, including substance abuse and dependence, they
    may represent new foci for prevention. This presentation shows how latent
    pathways can be linked to distal outcomes to examine whether pathways to
    adulthood have unique implications for adult alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana
    abuse and dependence above and beyond substance use in adolescence.

    One of the major changes that have taken place in India over the last
    two decades is a significant shift in the sex ratio at birth, as techniques for
    prenatal sex determination have become more widely available. There has, however,
    been little analysis of which factors influence the decision to abort female fetuses
    at the individual level. Furthermore, the sparse literature does not address the
    relationship between fertility, spacing and the demand for sex selective abortions,
    which may lead to biased estimates. Using data from the three rounds of the National
    Family and Health Survey this paper relies on the observed spacing between births
    to examine the determinants of the demand for sex selective abortions. By employing
    a discrete hazard model it is possible to simultaneously control for the fertility
    and abortion decisions, while taking account of censoring and unobservable characteristics
    that might affect either.

    Previous studies of ethnic residential segregation within urban environments
    have suggested several factors as potential determinants of the phenomenon. Physical
    characteristics of the urban environment, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics,
    preferences for neighborhood composition, and discrimination have all been identified
    as playing a major role in determining the spatial distribution of ethnic groups
    within modern cities. However, few studies have attempted to explicitly identify
    the manner in which residential patterns emerge from the interaction of these
    factors in field settings. Recently, important strides have been made in this
    direction by researchers using agent-based and cellular automata models; unfortunately,
    these efforts  have been hampered by a lack of inferential tools to connect theoretical
    models with extant data.

    Using a recently developed statistical framework based on discrete exponential
    family models that bridges this "inferential gap," this project addresses the
    following questions: 1. What are, in general, the conditions under which residential
    systems become segregated? 2. Given information on the current  configuration
    of a residential system, how can we plausibly identify the mechanisms that could
    have led to that particular configuration? 3. How do metropolitan areas across
    the United States differ in terms of the mechanisms that drive residential settlement?

    I first explore the circumstances in which settlement processes lead to segregation
    through simulations of an artificial residential system with two racial/ethnic
    groups, focusing in particular on in-group preference (homophily) and outgroup
    avoidance (xenophobia). I then turn to a sample of metropolitan areas and seek
    to identify the types of processes that could have led to their present residential
    system configuration, as captured by the 2000 U.S. census. I discuss the contribution
    of the project to our understanding of residential settlement and segregation
    and suggest some directions for future work.'

    Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is an innovative sampling technique that
    has recently gained considerable popularity as a method for studying ?hidden?
    and "hard-to-reach" populations with particular attention to populations at high
    risk of HIV infection. RDS can be very successful as a survey recruitment strategy
    for populations that are otherwise intractable to study, and has been used in
    at least 128 studies around the world. Yet despite the widespread use of RDS,
    there remain serious questions about the statistical validity of the methodology.
    In particular it is unclear whether or not samples collected using RDS can be
    used to infer population-level characteristics. This talk will give an introduction
    to the RDS methodology and the scientific issues that the method raises. In particular
    we will examine whether or not the RDS methodology can produce unbiased estimates
    of population characteristics. This talk will be of particular interest to researchers
    considering using RDS to recruit study participants. No special background in
    survey sampling will be required.

- abstract: 'The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has developed
    the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) for making national estimates and
    short term projections of HIV prevalence in countries with generalized epidemics.
    This combines a mechanistic epidemiological model with prevalence data from antenatal
    clinics and from household surveys.


    Understanding uncertainty in its estimates and projections is important for policy,
    and UNAIDS now uses Bayesian melding as the basis for its probabilistic projections
    of HIV prevalence. Initially, the posterior distribution was approximated by sampling-importance-resampling,
    which is simple to implement, easy to interpret, transparent to users and gave
    acceptable results for most countries. For some countries, however, this is not
    computationally efficient because the posterior distribution tends to be concentrated
    around nonlinear ridges and can also be multimodal. We propose instead Incremental
    Mixture Importance Sampling (IMIS), which iteratively builds up a better importance
    sampling function. This retains the simplicity and transparency of sampling importance
    resampling, but is much more efficient computationally. It also leads to a simple
    estimator of the integrated likelihood that is the basis for Bayesian model comparison
    and model averaging. In simulation experiments and on real data it outperformed
    both sampling importance resampling and generic MCMC algorithms.

- abstract: 'I first review the potential outcome (Neyman-Rubin) causal model in the
    context of a simple randomized experiment with a binary treatment (X) and binary
    outcome (Y). I then consider the situation in which experimental subjects do not
    comply, so that the treatment to which subjects are randomized (Z) may differ
    from that which they receive (X).


    The latter situation is an instance of the binary instrumental variable model.
    It is well known that this model is not identified by the observed joint distribution
    p(x,y,z). Consequently many statistical analyses impose additional assumptions,
    or change the causal estimand of interest in order to achieve identification.


    Here we take a different approach, directly characterizing and graphically displaying
    the set of distributions over potential outcomes that correspond to a given population
    distribution p(x,y,z). This provides insights into the variation dependence between
    average causal effects for various compliance groups, that are partially identified.
    The analysis also leads directly to re-parameterizations that may be used for
    Bayesian inference and the development of models that incorporate baseline covariates.

    This talk addresses some statistical challenges in a study of the relationship
    between prenatal alcohol exposure and neurocognitive functioning in a sample of
    419 Seattle-area 21-year-olds who had been examined systematically in respect
    of alcohol behavioral teratology since midway through their mothers' pregnancies
    in 1974-75.  A five-hour laboratory examination of 17 neurocognitive tests administered
    at a mean age of 21.5 years yielded a total of 164 outcome scores. Prenatal alcohol
    exposure was quantified by a previously published combination of thirteen measures
    of self- reported maternal alcohol use optimally predicting offspring deficits
    at earlier ages.

    A concern for possible effects of loss-to-follow-up in this longitudinal study
    let to our study of outcomes in terms of their joint prediction by prenatal alcohol
    and occupational status of the household (mid-pregnancy). It has been convincingly
    argued that analyses of neuropsychological outcomes in a context like this should
    adjust for parental IQ.  In the absence of measures of parental IQ we chose to
    adjust all outcomes for offspring IQ in accord with a path analytic argument.  Patterns
    of relationship of IQ-adjusted outcomes with prenatal alcohol and occupational
    status were analyzed by principal components analysis and summarization in terms
    of odds ratios of extreme outcomes.  Our results identify one nonlinear bivariate
    prediction function that represents certain neurocoginitive deficits only at lower
    occupational levels and only at the highest levels of exposure.  A Spatial-Visual
    Reasoning Task

    (SVRT) demonstrated the clearest alcohol-related deficits in this context and
    the result of this multivariate analysis is well- summarized by an odds ratio
    of deficit on one single speed-accuracy tradeoff score.

    The confounding of socioeconomic factors with the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure
    on neurocognitive functioning in this sample of adults cannot be resolved by the
    usual methods of multiple regression.  Models must consider the effects of alcohol
    and occupational status jointly, rather than "adjusting" the effect of either
    for the other. The surprisingly focused finding of an effect of prenatal alcohol
    exposure on spatial-visual reasoning, a test not in standard neuropsychological
    assess, emt batteries, suggests further study of this task as a teratogenic outcome.

    A major aim of longitudinal analyses of life course data is to describe
    the within- and between-individual variability in a behavioral outcome such as
    crime. Methods for life course data typically draw on mixed-effects growth and
    mixture models. For example, group-based trajectory modeling assumes a mixture
    of groups where each group is defined by a distinct polynomial relationship between
    age and behavior.

    Here we take a different approach, assuming a common age-crime curve and allowing
    individual crime trajectories to differ by latent patterns of temporal misalignment
    and amplitudes. We analyze self- reported counts of yearly marijuana use from
    the Denver Youth Survey, assuming a unimodal age-crime curve. We employ a non-
    parametric Bayesian hierarchical curve registration approach to estimate the age-crime
    curve and individual amplitudes and time- transformation functions. Our approach
    captures individual heterogeneity in meaningful terms by allowing differences
    in the level of offending and in the timing of features such as age at desistance.
    We compare our results with those from a group-based trajectory analysis graphically
    and numerically with a cross- validation study. (Joint work with Donatello Telesca,

    Consider an object with arbitrary mass density. Its gravitational
    field can be computed exactly and uniquely via Newton's
    equations. Now, suppose measurements are taken on the
    gravitational field. Can we infer the mass density of the object?
    This problem is generally known as the inverse problem, and arises
    in a wide range of fields. In this talk, a statistical approach is
    taken to solving that problem. Specifically, instead of inferring
    mass density itself, the problem is cast into a classification
    framework, and it is shown that a number of linear and nonlinear
    classifiers can be employed to provide a conditional probability
    of class membership.  The performance of the classifiers is gauged

    consisting of relationships between actors and sometimes represented by

    graphs,

    have been widely modeled by Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMs).

    An important practical stumbling block for modeling observed data by ERGMs

    is the so-called near-degeneracy problem:

    ERGMs tend to place most probability mass on a small number of graphs;

    the graphs with non-negligible probability mass do not resemble observed

    data;

    and ERGMs are unstable in the sense that small changes in parameter values

    are associated with large changes in the probability mass function.

    The near-degeneracy problem of ERGMs has important consequences for

    simulating data from ERGMs and inferring from observed data to ERGMs.

    Some proposed solutions (e.g.\ curved exponential-family models) have

    alleviated, but not solved, the near-degeneracy problem.

    We propose hierarchical, non-parametric Bayesian extensions of ERGMs with a

    view to solving the near-degeneracy problem.

    The proposed modeling framework is simple, general, and has an appealing

    interpretation in social science terms.

    Current estimation focuses on estimating population averages in the hard-to-reach

    We demonstrate the sensitivity of the current estimator to violations of these
    assumptions.  We then introduce two new estimators which allow for the without-replacement
    structure of the sample, and demonstrate their superior performance, particularly
    in cases where the sample fraction is large.'

- abstract: We propose a novel way of statistically post-processing forecast ensembles
    using heteroskedastic censored (Tobit) regression, where location and spread derive
    from the ensemble forecast. The resulting ensemble model output statistics (EMOS)
    method is applied to wind speed forecasts over the Pacific Northwest using the
    University of Washington Mesoscale Ensemble and to inflation forecasts from the
    Survey of Professional Forecasters. The statistically post-processed EMOS density
    forecasts turn out to be calibrated and sharp, and result in substantial improvement
    over the unprocessed ensembles.

- abstract: In October 2006, Netflix released 100 million movie ratings as part of
    a $1M prize for any team that could improve their movie recommendation system
    by more than 10%. This landmark data set generated intense interest from the statistics
    and machine learning communities, and attracted entries from over 3000 teams from
    academia and industry. In this talk, I will review AT&T's experience analyzing
    this data using collaborative filtering techniques, leading to our winning two
    $50,000 progress prizes, as well as a subsequent project applying the methodology
    to television viewing data.

    Cause-specific mortality data is critical information for public health
    decision-making, but in many areas of the world it is not routinely recorded.  In
    the past several decades, Verbal Autopsy (VA) has emerged as an interview-based
    approach to fill this gap. Until recently, however, the methods for implementation
    and analysis of VA were costly, time-consuming, and not validated. I will present
    an overview of a recently completed multisite validation study where researchers
    meticulously collected over 10,000 VA interviews for which the underlying cause
    of death was known with near certainty.

    It was when the preliminary data from this validation study
    arrived at IHME that I learned about this quantitative challenge,
    and I knew that I had to get involved.  Many, many work hours
    later, we have now wrapped up an analysis, which was recently
    published in a special issue of Population Health Metrics
    (http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/series/verbal_autopsy).  In this
    work, we realized that even measuring how well a VA analysis
    method performs is non-trivial. I will tell you about our new
    metrics that quantify the quality of VA analysis methods and I
    will also tell you about the results of the "horserace" of
    analytic methods that we ran. We reached the conclusion that a
    variant of the Random Forest classifier yields the highest quality
    results, better even than human experts.

- abstract: 'Civil registration and vital statistics systems are of critical importance
    in providing necessary information to assess the general health conditions of
    a population. Yet, in most developing countries, these systems are either inexistent
    or incomplete. Demographers and researchers in other fields have long been using
    different techniques to indirectly estimate either summary mortality indices such
    as probability of dying from birth to age 5 (5q0), or a full life table that contains
    various indices describing the dying out of a hypothetical population cohort.


    In this paper, we propose a new model life table system that satisfies the following
    desirable attributes. First, it is parsimonious and requires only a few entry
    parameters to generate a full life table. Second, it could adequately capture
    the range of age patterns of mortality observed in real populations and yield
    high predictive validity, not just measured by summary indices such as life expectancy
    at birth, but more importantly by age specific mortality rates. Third, it provides
    satisfactory estimates of age specific mortality for countries with high levels
    of mortality, especially those plagued by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, it could
    generate age specific mortality with a plausible time trend, and the partial derivative
    of entry parameters such as 5q0 and 45q15 should be positive with respect to age
    specific mortality.


    Our new model life table system is built upon a database with 7,294 empirical
    life tables, among which 1,174 (16.4%) are from populations with over 0.1% HIV
    seroprevalence among adults with ages 15 to 59. Preliminary results show that
    this new model exhibits both greater versatility and high predictive validity
    in estimating age specific mortality than various life table systems. In addition,
    our model's ability to estimate age specific mortality rates in the presence
    of significant HIV/AIDS epidemic is likely to be of considerable value in providing
    mortality estimates for countries plagued by the epidemic.

- abstract: 'With the increasing availability of network and behavioral data---from
    what we buy,

    to where we travel, to whom we know---we are now able to observe and quantify
    social

    processes to a degree that would have seemed impossible just a decade ago. These
    new

    microscopes into human activity not only have substantive implications for the

    social sciences, including economics, sociology, and psychology, but also raise

    challenging computational questions in large-scale data analysis.


    Leveraging these new data sources and computational tools, in this talk I will

    discuss the diffusion patterns that arise in six online domains, which in aggregate

    involve millions of adoption events and billions of individual-level interactions.

    Though the relationship between interpersonal networks and diffusion is important
    to

    a wide range of social and economic problems, including new product adoption,

    changes in social norms, and success in cultural markets, until recently it has
    been

    prohibitively difficult to accurately measure the structure of these networks.
    In

    all six cases we study---and in contrast to prevailing theories of diffusion---we

    find that multi-step cascades are relatively rare, with almost all adoptions

    occurring within one generation of the seed. Correspondingly, we find that the

    average size of diffusion events is surprisingly small, with each seed typically

    leading to less than one additional adopter.'

    Built environment (BE) and health research has focused on
    characteristics of home neighborhoods, whereas overall
    environmental exposures occur over larger spatial ranges. In this
    talk we introduce SmartMaps which provide measures of local BE
    characteristics for a large set of GPS locations. Empirically we
    found that for most subjects, home and non-home BE exposures
    differed significantly. Our results suggest that considering the
    full range of individuals’ environmental exposures may improve the
    understanding of effects of BE on behavior and health outcomes.

- abstract: There are several challenges to testing the effectiveness of group therapy-based
    interventions in alcohol and other drug use (AOD) treatment settings. Enrollment
    into AOD therapy groups typically occurs on an open (or rolling) basis. As the
    therapy group's membership changes over the course of any single client's tenure,
    this induces a complex correlation structure among client outcomes. The difficulties
    involved with modeling this correlation are exacerbated by having relatively small
    numbers of clients attending each therapy group session. Another challenge is
    that primary outcomes are measured after group therapy ends, so that each post-treatment
    datum reflects the effect of all sessions attended by a client. Since such data
    are relatively sparse for estimating the effect of any one session of an open-enrollment
    therapy group on client outcomes, it is important to model post-treatment outcomes
    data as parsimoniously as possible. However, the number of post-treatment outcomes
    assessments is typically very limited, which imposes constraints on how realistically
    longitudinal changes in client outcomes can be modeled. Our modeling strategy
    combines two novel applications of Bayesian hierarchical modeling to improve inference
    and model fit given the constraints imposed by data from AOD group therapy studies.
    First, we relax the assumption of independent random effects in the standard multiple
    membership model by employing conditional autoregression (CAR) to model correlation
    in random therapy group session effects associated with clients' attendance of
    common group therapy sessions. Second, we specify a longitudinal growth model
    under which the posterior distribution of client-specific random effects, or growth
    parameters, is modeled non-parametrically. The Dirichlet process prior helps us
    overcome parameter identification limitations of standard parametric growth models
    given limited numbers of longitudinal assessments. We motivate and illustrate
    our approach with a data set from a study of group cognitive behavioral therapy
    to reduce depressive symptoms among residential AOD treatment clients.

- abstract: Current methods for reconstructing human population structures of the
    past are deterministic or do not formally account for measurement error. We propose
    a method for simultaneously estimating age-specific population counts, fertility
    rates, mortality rates and net international migration flows from fragmentary
    data, that incorporates measurement error. Inference is based on joint posterior
    probability distributions which yield fully probabilistic interval estimates.
    It is designed for the kind of data commonly collected in modern demographic surveys
    and censuses. Population dynamics over the period of reconstruction are modeled
    by embedding formal demographic accounting relationships in a Bayesian hierarchical
    model. Informative priors are specified for vital rates, migration rates, population
    counts at baseline, and the accuracies of their respective measurements. We demonstrate
    the method with real data.

    Potential outcomes (aka counterfactuals) are extensively used
    within Statistics, Political Science, Economics, and Epidemiology for reasoning
    about causation. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are another formalism used to
    represent causal systems also extensively used in Computer Science, Bioinformatics,
    Sociology and Epidemiology. Given the utility of both approaches -- as demonstrated
    by many applications -- it is natural to to wish to unify them.

    I will present a simple approach to this synthesis based on an intuitive graphical
    transformation:  by "splitting" treatment nodes in a causal DAG over the actual
    variables, we form a new graph, the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The
    SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences associated with a specific hypothetical
    intervention on the set of treatment variables.

    I will contrast this new approach to previous attempts at unification such as
    the Non-Parametric Structural Equation Models with independent errors, proposed
    by Pearl (2000, 2009).

     Background: The public health importance of the U.S. obesity
     epidemic has been questioned by studies that have sought to link
     obesity with mortality. But properly estimating such a link
     requires careful consideration of age variation in obesity’s
     effect on mortality risk, as well as cohort variation in obesity
     prevalence. I estimate the percent of deaths for black and white
     men and women in the U.S. population between 1986 and 2006 that
     were associated with overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25.0 to <
     30.0), grade 1 obesity (BMI 30.0 to < 35.0), and grade 2/3
     obesity (BMI ≥ 35.0) by examining the combined effects of age
     variation in the obesity-mortality relationship and cohort
     variation in age-specific obesity prevalence.

     Methods: Nineteen cross-sectional, nationally representative
     waves of the National Health Interview Survey (1986-2004) were
     linked to individual mortality records at the National Death
     Index (NDI) through 2006, and examined for age and cohort
     patterns in obesity’s effect on U.S. mortality. Age, period, and
     cohort patterns of obesity prevalence were estimated using
     hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) cross classified random
     effects models (CCREM), and age patterns of the obesity-mortality
     association were estimated using Cox and Royston-Parmar survival
     models. Population Attributable Fractions (PAF) of overweight and
     obese body-mass as a cause of U.S. mortality between ages 40 and
     84 during the time period 1986-2006 were estimated by combining
     the age-specific effect of overweight and obesity on mortality
     risk with cohorts’ age-specific overweight and obesity prevalence
     rates.

     Findings: The percent of U.S. adult deaths between 1986 and 2006
     associated with overweight and obesity was 5.4 and 15.9 percent
     for black and white men, respectively, and 27.8 and 22.5 percent
     for black and white women, respectively. Key findings were
     significantly stronger associations between obesity and mortality
     at older ages, and higher percentages of mortality attributable
     to elevated BMI among younger birth cohorts.

     Interpretation: Previous research that did not properly account
     for age variation in obesity’s effect on mortality and/or cohort
     variation in the prevalence of obesity have underestimated the
     impact of the obesity epidemic on U.S. mortality. Methods that
     appropriately account for these factors estimate obesity to play
     a much larger role, placing it at the forefront of concern for
     public health action.

    This paper builds on the methods of local instrumental
    variables developed by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005) to
    estimate person-centered treatment (PeT) effects that are
    conditioned on the person’s observed characteristics and averaged
    over the potential conditional distribution of unobserved
    characteristics that lead them to their observed treatment
    choices. PeT effects are more individualized than conditional
    treatment effects from a randomized setting with the same observed
    characteristics. PeT effects can be easily aggregated to construct
    any of the mean treatment effect parameters and, more importantly,
    are well-suited to comprehend individual-level treatment effect
    heterogeneity. The paper presents the theory behind PeT effects,
    studies their finite-sample properties using simulations and
    presents a novel analysis of treatment evaluation in health care.

    I argue that the use of repressive policy tools appears
    to have remained flat over time because of a changing standard of
    accountability that reporting agencies use to hold states
    responsible for abuse. The standard of accountability is a set of
    expectations or norms that state behaviors are measured against.
    Though scholars have discussed the possibility of a changing
    standard of accountability at length, this concept has not been
    systematically incorporated into measurement models of
    repression. The quality of inferences made about repression levels
    in different countries and over time depends on choosing a
    theoretically informed model that best approximates reality. This
    paper is the first to test for a changing standard of
    accountability in a model of repressive outcomes by extending a
    dynamic Bayesian measurement model to incorporate multiple sources
    of events-based and standards-based information on repression. The
    measurement model extends existing latent variable models by (1)
    accounting for the fact that human rights indicators can be more
    or less informative about the latent level of repression, (2)
    providing a theoretical motivation for the modeling of temporal
    dependence in human rights levels within countries over time, and
    (3) and providing a theoretical motivation for the changing
    baseline probability of being coded at a given level of repression
    on the repression data included in the model. I also present
    several techniques that each demonstrate that the model
    outperforms alternatives. The analysis finds substantial evidence
    for an increasing standard of accountability, especially for the
    violation of the right not to be tortured.  By allowing this
    standard to vary with time, a new picture emerges of improving
    conditions over the period of study (1949-2010).

    Political opinion forms in the torrent of language surrounding all
    of us, but despite the recent proliferation of speech and social
    network data, existing models of political persuasion and
    communication remain rooted in simplistic frameworks of
    low-dimensional ideological spaces and basic expressive or
    information-transmitting speech. This work instead develops new
    techniques in automated text analysis and large-scale causal
    inference to model the complex interplay between speech, belief,
    and political behaviors.  It begins with the simple case of
    expressive speech in legislatures, where new Bayesian and spatial
    text scaling methods allow us to accurately predict both the
    ideology and voting behavior of individual legislators.  In the
    more complex case of persuasive speech, ensembles of simple
    regression models allow us to measure the effects of hundreds of
    different TV ads, and new text methods allow us to predict the
    effects of ads based only on their text, and to infer a dense
    interplay of persuasive strategies not captured by existing
    approaches.  The work finishes with the most complex and common
    case of persuasive speech, interpersonal conversation. Employing a
    new dataset of millions of online political discussions, a new
    semi-supervised application of a Bayesian topic model is used to
    reveal the conceptual network of ideas and issues at work in the
    minds of discussants; to predict the topics of conversational
    replies based on what was said before; and to infer the long-term
    effects of this speech via a panel vector autoregression model.
    This approach to modeling persuasive speech should also be broadly
    applicable to many other political domains: the media, the
    judiciary, Congressional bills and committees, and the burgeoning
    world of social networks.

    An ideal democratic legislature is both decisive and accountable
    to voters, but these two goals are often at odds. In fact,
    politicians commonly have an incentive to obscure the messy
    details of legislative compromise from their constituents. Floor
    voting records provide information that citizens can use to hold
    their representatives accountable. Yet, most parliaments call roll
    only when the membership requests a recorded vote. Thus,
    legislators' strategic incentives can interfere with parliamentary
    transparency and accountability. Moreover, this strategic
    selection process undermines the inferences that social scientists
    draw from roll call vote analyses. I show how to apply techniques
    from statistical natural language processing to the text of
    legislative debates to predict recorded vote requests in the
    European Parliament. In turn, I use measures derived from the
    predictive model to explore when, and why, party leaders choose to
    publicize the voting record. I find that European parties request
    roll on especially controversial issues and use public votes to
    highlight disagreements within the legislature. Notably, party
    leaders call roll to lay blame on other parties for policies that
    their own rank and file oppose.

    This project explains why some Muslim clerics adopt the ideology
    of militant Jihad while most do not. I show that clerics are far
    more likely to become producers of Jihadist ideology when they
    lack a dense, well-connected educational network. These poorly
    connected clerics face severe disadvantages on the cleric job
    market, which push them toward outsider career paths and
    ideological extremism. I provide evidence of these dynamics by
    collecting and analyzing 29,430 fatwas, articles, and books
    written by 91 contemporary clerics. Using statistical natural
    language processing --- a modified Naïve Bayes classifier --- I
    measure the extent to which each cleric adopts Jihadi ideology in
    their writing. I combine this with biographical and network
    information about each cleric make descriptive and causal
    inference about the process by which poorly-connected clerics
    become more likely to adopt Jihadi ideology.

    This talk concerns the development of Bayesian methods for
    two-phase   studies. Two-phase designs are appealing from an efficiency perspective   since
    they allow sampling to be concentrated in informative cells. A   number of likelihood-based
    methods have been developed for the analysis   of two-phase data, but we describe
    a Bayesian approach that has   previously been unavailable. We extend the methodology
    to include random   effects terms in the model to perform different kinds of smoothing.
    In   particular, we are interested in the use of two-phase studies in a   spatial
    epidemiological context where one may wish to acknowledge   confounding by location
    via the introduction of spatial random effects,   however random effects can also
    be included to smooth the cell   probabilities in large contingency tables, particularly
    in the case of   sparse data. The Bayesian two-phase approach is illustrated using
    data   collected on Wilms tumour, as well as infant mortality in North Carolina.

    In comparative effectiveness studies, we are interested in
    estimating the causal effect of a new treatment relative to a
    standard one on patient’s outcomes, such as the health related
    quality of life (HRQOL), after a certain time period of taking the
    treatment.  In these studies, some patients may die before their
    outcomes can be measured, and hence, their measures are not well
    defined.

    For example, in a randomized trial comparing a new drug with a
    traditional drug, we are interested in estimating the causal
    effect of the new drug relative to the old drug on the health
    related quality of life (HRQOL) after a certain time period of
    taking the treatment.  But some of the patients in the study may
    die before their outcomes are measured. One main issue with
    estimation of such the causal effect is parameter identifiability.
    We first show that the causal effect of interest is not
    identifiable non-parametrically under the commonly made regularity
    conditions in the causal inference literature. We then introduce a
    concept of using one additional baseline covariate associated with
    principal strata to make the causal effect identifiable. After we
    derive the sufficient conditions for identifiability of the causal
    effect, we then propose a non-parametric method for estimating the
    causal effect of interest. Our simulation studies show the
    proposed estimation methods work well in finite-sample sizes.
    Finally, we apply our approach to a data set from Southwest
    Oncology Group (SWOG) clinical trial on the effectiveness of the
    treatment of docetaxel and estramustine (DE) with mitoxantrone and
    prednisone (MP) in patients with metastatic, androgen-independent
    prostate cancer.  This is a joint with Peng Din, Zhi Geng, and Wei

    Some patterns of association that  naturally appear in, for
    example, market basket analysis, text recognition,  multistage capture-recapture
    procedures, and others seem irregular if  considered from the point of view of
    conventional log-linear models. Such  patterns of association cannot be described
    using partitions in a contingency  table, and thus are lacking the so-called overall
    effect. The lack of the  overall effect is an intrinsic property of a model, and
    cannot be fixed by a re-parameterization. Models without the overall  effect are
    illustrated using a model of independence between two morphological  structures
    in the Hungarian language. Traditional iterative scaling procedures,  used for
    computing the expected cell counts in contingency tables, do not work  for such
    a model. The algorithm described in this presentation can be used for  models
    with or without the overall effect.

    Drawing on a series of studies that closely examine how education
    is associated with mortality over time and across groups, this
    lecture showcases the ways in which the underlying association
    between education and the risk of death has changed since the mid
    20th century. The first part of the talk highlights changes in the
    underlying functional form of the association. The second part of
    the talk introduces Age-Period-Cohort models that document the
    growing importance of education in establishing a cohort's
    morbidity phenotype and the receding influence of early childhood
    factors -- for some but not all population subgroups in the United
    States. The results highlight not only the importance of the
    shifts in educational composition of the population but also a
    fundamental shift in the importance of more and more education in
    garnering health advantages.

    Climate models are used to understand the current state of the climate
    and to predict its future behavior. In this talk I will describe a
    statistical approach for improving climate model projections of the
    North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The AMOC is
    part of the global ocean conveyor belt circulation and transfers heat
    between low and high latitudes in the Atlantic basin. The AMOC might
    collapse in a "tipping point" response to anthropogenic climate
    forcings. One key source of uncertainty in AMOC projections from a
    climate model is uncertainty about a climate model parameter called
    background ocean vertical diffusivity, Kv. Kv cannot be directly
    measured but can be inferred from two sources of information: (1)
    physical observations from the oceans (so called tracers) that are
    related to Kv, and (2) climate model output at various Kv settings. I
    will describe a Gaussian process-based emulation and calibration
    approach for Kv inference. This approach accounts for non-linear
    relationships between the tracers, data-model discrepancies, and
    various sources of uncertainties and dependence. This approach also
    uses sparse matrix techniques to overcome the considerable
    computational obstacles posed by the size of the data.

    Laboratories), Roman Olson (Geosciences, Penn State University), Klaus

    A primary tool for the experimental psychologist is the use of
    ''psychophysics'', which is the quantitative measurement sensory experience as
    measured with behavioral responses.  A common psychophysical measure is the
    ''threshold'', which is the weakest stimulus needed to be reliably detected.
    Psychophysicists have standard methods for measuring thresholds which
    involves concepts and procedures including signal detection theory, maximum
    likelihood model fitting and bootstrapping.  I will provide a general
    overview of the psychophysical methods for threshold measurement, hopefully
    in a context that a statistician might find interesting.

    The model-based clustering latent space network model represents
    relational data visually and takes account of several basic network
    properties. Due to the structure of its likelihood function, the
    computational cost is of order O(N^2), where N is the number of nodes. This
    makes it infeasible for large networks. We propose an approximation of the
    log likelihood function. We adapt the case-control idea from epidemiology
    and construct an approximate case-control log likelihood which is an
    unbiased estimator of the full log likelihood. Replacing the full likelihood
    by the case-control likelihood in the MCMC estimation of the latent space
    model reduces the computational time from O(N^2) to O(N), making it feasible
    for large networks. We evaluate its performance using simulated and real
    data. We fit the model to a large protein-protein interaction data using the
    case-control likelihood and use the model fitted link probabilities to
    identify false positive links.  This is joint with with Xiaoyue Niu, Peter
    Hoff and Ka Yee Yeung.

    Many analyses of health care costs involve use of data with
    varying periods of observation and right censoring of cases before
    death or the end of the episode of illness. The prominence of
    observations with no expenditure for some short periods of
    observation and the extreme skewness typical of these data raise
    concerns about the robustness of estimators based on inverse
    probability weighting (IPW) with the survival from censoring
    probabilities. These estimators also cannot distinguish between
    the effects of covariates on survival and intensity of
    utilization, which jointly determine costs. In this paper, we
    propose a new estimator that extends the class of two-part models
    to deal with random right censoring and for continuous death and
    censoring times. Our model also addresses issues about the time to
    death in these analyses and separates the survival effects from
    the intensity effects. Using simulations, we compare our proposed
    estimator to the inverse probability estimator, which shows bias
    when censoring is large and covariates affect survival. We find
    our estimator to be unbiased and also more efficient for these
    designs. We apply our method and compare it to the IPW method
    using data from the Medicare-SEER files on prostate cancer.

    This paper presents a generalized autoregressive distributed lag
    (GADL) model for conducting regression estimations that involve
    mixed-frequency data. As an example, we show that daily asset market
    information - currency and equity market movements - can produce
    forecasts of quarterly commodity price changes that are superior to
    those in the previous research. Following the traditional ADL
    literature, our estimation strategy relies on a Vandermonde matrix to
    parameterize the weighting functions for higher-frequency
    observations. Accordingly, inferences can be obtained using ordinary
    least squares principles without Kalman filtering, non-linear
    optimizations, or additional restrictions on the parameters. Our
    findings provide an easy-to-use method for conducting mixed
    data-sampling analysis as well as for forecasting world commodity
    Price movements.

    The basal ganglia are a set of interconnected nuclei located in
    the middle of the brain. There is much evidence that the basal
    ganglia they play a crucial role in many cognitive functions
    (including language, attention, learning, and working
    memory). However, their particular physiology and their widespread
    involvement makes it is difficult to investigate the role of basal
    ganglia using typical neuroimaging methods.

    In this talk I will show that a modeling approach can be used to
    circumvent these obstacles. In particular, I will discuss a set of
    neurocomputational models that account for various properties of
    the basal ganglia circuit in a mechanistic way. According to these
    models, the basal ganglia control the routing of signals between
    cortical regions, making it possible to quickly and flexibly adapt
    the flow of information processing in the brain.

    These models’ predictions cannot be verified directly with typical
    neuroimaging methods. However, they can be tested with a more
    sophisticated approach called Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), which
    allows estimating the effective connectivity within a network of
    predefined brain regions. As an example, I will present some
    preliminary results of the application of DCM to understanding the
    role of the basal ganglia in autism.

    In the US Census Classification (1970) jobs are pairs of 3-digit
    (Industry x Occupation) codes. Any analysis of career data and
    dynamics of employment has to cope with the inherent high
    dimensionality of this representation. We work under the
    assumption that "job" is actually a continuous variable, and infer
    the continuity from the transitions people take between jobs, as
    recorded by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
    (NLSY). Thus, proximity between jobs will mean that they are
    “close” to each other in a non-negligible subset of career
    paths. The embedding we obtain allows one to visualize the job
    landscape. Moreover, one can map individual or groups of career
    paths to this space, extract features of their collective
    structure, and construct statistical tests comparing groups by
    means of this mapping.

    On the theoretical side, we show that this work is an instance of
    fitting a particular generative model for asymmetric relational
    data. We provide theorems that ground and motivate our algorithms,
    and that ensure asymptotic consistency of the results.

    In recent years some archaeologists have analysed artefacts using phylogenetic
    methods to understand the history of changes in human culture. Phylogenetics
    provides a coherent method for quantitatively comparing variation between
    objects, systematically representing this variation over time, and generating
    novel hypotheses about historical relationships. The use of these methods is
    especially compelling in areas traditionally dominated by qualitative analysis,
    such as art-history.  I evaluate the necessary conditions for a cladistic
    analysis of material culture and examine a case study of bronze Buddha statues
    from Thailand. I use a suite of statistical methods to test for the presence of
    a phylogenetic signal amongst the sample of statues. Using cladistic analyses
    I propose new hypotheses about the history of Buddhism in Thailand.

    To date, most network modeling has been descriptive, but
    a mature science requires predictive models whose predictions are
    empirically verified. It also requires a mathematical language
    in which these models are easily and compactly defined, and an
    efficient computational implementation of it. Markov logic is a
    language for network science, based on combining Markov networks
    and first-order logic. Here we extend Markov logic to handle
    decision-theoretic problems, and apply it to viral marketing.
    This has two components: learning a model of the social network
    from data, and using it to design a marketing plan that maximizes
    utility (profits minus marketing costs). Applied to the Epinions
    Web of Trust, our approach greatly outperforms previous ones. Our
    learning and inference algorithms are available in the open-source
    Alchemy system (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/).

    Researchers in political science generally enjoy substantial
    latitude in selecting measures and models for hypothesis testing.
    Coupled with publication and related biases, this latitude raises
    the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally
    select models that yield positive findings, leading to an
    unreliable body of published research.  To combat this problem of
    "data fishing" in medical studies, leading journals now require
    preregistration of designs that emphasize the prior identification
    of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate
    here that even with this level of advanced specification, the
    scope for fishing is considerable when there is latitude over
    selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an
    analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use
    of a form of "comprehensive registration." We experiment with such
    an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for
    which we drafted a complete "mock report" of findings using fake
    data on treatment assignment. We describe the advantages and
    disadvantages of this form of comprehensive registration and
    propose that a comprehensive but non-binding approach be adopted
    as a first step in registration in political science. Likely eff
    ects of a comprehensive but non-binding registration are
    discussed, the principle advantage being communication rather than
    commitment, in particular that it generates a clear distinction
    between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.

    The talk uses the marginal modeling approach to graphical models
    to define path models for categorical data. Advantages of this
    approach include the applicability of standard procedures to test
    model fit and the availability of a complete parameterization of
    the joint distributions under the model. The marginal log-linear
    parameters involved measure the strengths of all relevant
    effects. This approach is in sharp contrast with estimating and
    interpreting ad hoc parameters, without paying attention to
    overall model fit and to other effects which also influence the
    joint distribution of the variables.

    The method is applied to the social status attainment process,
    that is to the analysis of effects influencing the social status
    an individual achieves. Two examples are presented. One compares
    the status attainment processes in the USA, Hungary and
    Czechoslovakia at the end of the last century, and shows that
    policies in the former socialist countries to prevent status
    inheritance had no success. The other example compares groups of
    countries with conservative and liberal welfare systems and
    reveals the differences in the effects of the fathers' positions
    on their sons' positions.

    Prediction of health outcomes lies at the heart of medical practice.
    The emergence of massive patient-level medical data opens up the
    possibility of dramatically improved predictive models that can
    profoundly alter medical practice.  This talk presents two such models
    and demonstrates their applicability using increasingly available
    large-scale medical data.  The first approach provides patients with
    interpretable predictions for which symptoms they may be likely to
    experience next, given a list of previous symptoms.  Specifically we
    propose the Hierarchical Association Rule Model (HARM) that generates
    a set of association rules such as "dyspepsia and epigastric pain"
    imply "heartburn," indicating that dyspepsia and epigastric pain are
    commonly followed by heartburn.  Next, we present a dynamic modeling
    framework which makes nearly real-time predictions using streaming,
    rapidly changing data.  This model accounts for uncertainty in the
    underlying data-generating mechanism through Dynamic Model Averaging,
    an extension of Bayesian Model Averaging that allows posterior model
    probabilities to change with time.  We apply our method to data from
    children with appendicitis who receive either a traditional (open)
    appendectomy or a laparoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that
    the factors associated with which children receive a particular type
    of procedure changed significantly over the seven years of data
    collection, a feature that is not captured using standard regression
    modeling.

    Social scientists have generated a large and inconclusive litera-
    ture on the effect(s) of marriage on men's wages. Researchers have
    hypothesized that the wage premium enjoyed by married men may
    reflect both a tendency for more productive men to marry and an
    effect of marriage on productivity. To sort out these
    explanations, researchers have used fixed effects regression
    models for panel data to adjust for selection on unobserved time
    invariant confounders, interpreting coefficients for the time
    varying marriage variables as effects. However, they did not
    define these effects or give conditions under which the regression
    coefficients would warrant a causal interpretation. Consequently,
    they failed to appropriately adjust for important time varying
    confounders and misinterpreted their results. Regression models
    for panel data with unobserved time invariant confounders are also
    widely used in many other policy relevant contexts and the same
    problems arise there. This paper draws on recent statistical work
    on causal inference with longitudinal data to clarify these
    problems and help researchers use appropriate methods to model
    their data. A basis set of treatment effects is defined and used
    to define derived effects. Causal models for panel data with
    unobserved time invariant confounders are defined and the
    treatment effects are reexpressed in terms of these
    models. Ignorability conditions under which the parameters of the
    causal models are identified from the regression models are
    given. Even when these hold, a number of interesting and important
    treatment effects are typically not identified.

    This paper helps gain purchase on the political instability that
    buffeted the MENA during the Arab Spring. The region's monarchies
    have largely elided turmoil and violence. The "republics" have
    not. This paper shows that this has also been the case
    historically. Furthermore, the association between political
    stability and monarchy is not driven by oil wealth; nor does oil
    explain why monarchies have higher quality institutions, provide
    more public goods, and have higher levels of educational
    attainment and faster economic growth. To help understand why
    there is a correlation between monarchy and these outcomes in the
    MENA, this paper introduces a theory about how an invented, yet
    historically rooted, political culture can solve a ruler's
    credible commitment problem. By securing elites' rights and
    interests, it bolsters their support of the regime. This paper
    also illustrates the evolution of monarchic political cultures
    over the history of the MENA. We document the geographic and
    biogeographic underpinnings of monarchy, arguing that extreme
    aridity and pastoral nomadism centered on camel herding sustained
    a tribal social structure. This unique equilibrium held despite
    millennia of imperialism, the spread of Islam, and European
    colonialism. A case study of Qatar’s history also corroborates
    this theory.

    This study was motivated by a debate in the Czech Republic on the
    requirement to report Cronbach’s alpha, a measure of reliability,
    for all higher education admissions tests. Cronbach’s alpha is a
    widely used estimator for assessing reliability
    (i.e. reproducibility under replicate conditions) of multi-item
    scales. One of its limitations is that it assumes a single
    underlying construct behind all items. Cronbach’s alpha also
    assumes that the item responses are continuous and therefore using
    it with scales of binary items is questionable.

    In this talk, I present work on the development of a new estimator
    of reliability appropriate for scales of binary items. I present a
    simulation study to compare the new estimator, *logistic alpha*,
    with Cronbach’s alpha and other existing estimators of
    reliability. I discuss the findings in the context of the real
    data from admission tests used in the Czech Republic.

    Passively generated mobile phone dataset is emerging as a new data
    source for research in human mobility patterns. Information on
    people’s trajectories is not directly available from such dataset;
    they must be inferred. Many questions remain in terms how well we
    can capture human mobility patterns from such dataset. Only one
    study has compared the results from a mobile phone dataset to
    those from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), though the
    comparison is on two different populations and samples. This study
    constitutes one of the first, if not the first, study that
    systematically validates the results from a mobile phone dataset
    against the ground truth. Clearly, more studies of the same type
    are needed. The findings reported are promising. The distribution
    of the activity locations identified from the simulation dataset
    resembles the true distribution quite well and the majority of the
    home and work places are correctly identified, within a relatively
    short distance from the true ones. These results point to the
    tremendous potential that these passively generated mobile phone

    We consider the historical development of a characteristic crucial for
    the functioning and normative appeal of Westminster systems: cohesive legislative
    parties. To do this, we gather the universe of the twenty thousand parliamentary
    divisions that took place between 1836 and 1910 in the British House of Commons,
    construct a voting record for every Member of Parliament serving during this time,
    and carry out analysis that aims to both describe and explain the development
    of cohesive party voting. In line with previous work, we show that -- with the
    exception of a chaotic period in the 1840s and 1850s -- median discipline was
    always high and increased throughout the century, with an obvious uptick around
    1868. We use novel methods to show that much of the rise in cohesion results from
    the elimination of a rebellious "left tail" from the 1860s onwards, rather than
    central tendency shifts. In explaining the aggregate trends, we use panel data
    techniques to show that there is scant evidence for "replacement" explanations
    that involve new intakes of members behaving in more disciplined ways than those
    leaving the chamber. We offer evidence that more loyal MPs were more likely to
    obtain ministerial posts, and speculate that this and other "inducement"-based
    accounts offer more promising explanations of increasingly cohesive parties.

    Matching and weighting estimators are often used to adjust for
    differences between treated and control groups on observed
    characteristics. These methods require the user to choose what functions
    of the covariates to include in balancing procedures, and do not ensure
    equal multivariate densities of the treated and control groups. As a
    result, functions of the covariates that influence the outcome may
    remain imbalanced, biasing treatment effect estimates. This talk
    introduces kernel balancing, a method designed to reduce or eliminate
    such bias, without relying on specification searches or balance tests.
    The weights derived by kernel balancing (1) achieve approximate mean
    balance on a large set of smooth functions of the covariates, and (2)
    approximately equalize the multivariate densities of the treated and
    controls. In an empirical application, I reanalyze a widely cited study
    finding that democracies are as likely as non-democracies to
    successfully defeat insurgencies, contrary to prior theoretical and
    empirical evidence. Kernel balancing shows that this result is likely
    due to insufficient balance achieved by matching estimates. When
    democracies and non-democracies are compared on more similar cases,
    democracies are substantively and statistically less likely to defeat
    insurgencies.

    Chinese government censorship of social media constitutes
    the largest selective suppression of human communication in the history
    of the world. Three approaches are taken to learn about this system.
    First is an observational study where millions of social media posts are
    downloaded before the Chinese government can read and censor those they
    deem objectionable. Second, to make causal inferences, a large scale
    randomized experimental study is conducted. And finally, for descriptive
    inferences, the current approach of conducting confidential interviews
    is supplemented by setting up a own social media site in China,
    contracting with Chinese firms to install the same censoring
    technologies as existing sites, and reverse engineering how it all
    works. Results offer unambiguous support for, and clarification of, the
    view that criticism of the state, its leaders, and their policies are
    routinely published whereas posts with collective action potential are
    much more likely to be censored. This approach also clarifies the
    internal mechanisms of the Chinese censorship apparatus and show that
    local social media sites have far more flexibility than was previously
    understood in how (but not what) they censor. This talk is based on two
    papers, available at http://bit.ly/CensorObsn and http://bit.ly/CensorExpt.

    How do events within war affect financial market assessments of
    how the war will end? This question is both intrinsically
    interesting and provides a method for researchers of war to assess
    how battles influence war termination in an environment where
    there is little quality quantitative intra-war data. Since bond
    prices are a function of expected future payments and war results
    can have a large influence on the probability of receiving those
    payments, sovereign bonds can act like a pseudo-prediction market
    of the war result. Due to their high frequency, financial markets
    can be used to assess which events affected the expected war
    result, and the magnitude of those effects.

    This paper focuses on the American Civil War, and estimates the
    effects of major battles in the American Civil War on the price of
    bonds issued by the Union. To do so, it introduces two datasets:
    one of the battles of the American Civil War and another of the
    financial market prices of issued by the state and federal
    governments during that era. The effect of battles on prices is
    estimated within the Bayesian dynamic linear model framework. This
    paper shows how Bayesian dynamic linear models can easily and
    efficiently be estimated with the software package, Stan.  This is
    done by combining Stan''s Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with
    Forward Filter-Backwards Sampling on the latent states.

    Some patterns of association that naturally appear in, for
    example, market basket analysis, text recognition, multistage
    capture-recapture procedures, and others seem irregular if
    considered from the point of view of conventional log-linear
    models. Such patterns of association cannot be described using
    partitions in a contingency table, and thus are lacking the
    so-called overall effect. The lack of the overall effect is an
    intrinsic property of a model, and cannot be fixed by a
    re-parameterization. Models without the overall effect are
    illustrated using a model of independence between two
    morphological structures in the Hungarian language. Traditional
    iterative scaling procedures, used for computing the expected cell
    counts in contingency tables, do not work for such a model. The
    algorithm described in this presentation can be used for models
    with or without the overall effect.

    Tooth decay is the most common disease among U.S.  children,
    including children with chronic conditions. When untreated, tooth  decay can lead
    to pain, infection, hospitalization, and in rare cases death. Children  with chronic
    conditions are at increased risk for unmet dental care needs.  While studies have
    examined the extent to which having a chronic condition  affects use of office-based
    dental care, no studies have examined whether  children with chronic conditions
    are greater risk for being hospitalized for  non-traumatic dental conditions.
    In this talk, I will present findings from a  study that examines U.S. pediatric
    inpatient hospitalization trends for  non-traumatic dental conditions (NTDCs)
    with the goal of identifying the role  of complex chronic condition (CCCs) on
    the odds of being hospitalized for  NTDCs.

    The two fundamental models in the theory of incentives address
    problems due to hidden information, and problems due to hidden
    action.  This introduction will mainly focus on models of hidden
    information.  For example, a regulated firm may want to overstate
    cost to obtain a higher regulated price, while a buyer may be keen
    to under-report willingness to pay to obtain a lower price.
    Addressing these concerns may lead to quantity and quality
    distortions (e.g., restrictions in airline travel).  A goal is to
    illustrate the similarity in the mathematical structure of several
    prominent incentive problems, e.g., Firm Regulation, Price
    Discrimination, and Income Taxation.  I will also outline briefly

    In randomized studies evaluating treatments for tuberculosis (TB),
    individuals are scheduled to be routinely evaluated for the
    presence of TB using sputum cultures. One important endpoint in
    such stud- ies is the time of culture conversion, which is the
    first visit at which a patient’s sputum culture is negative and
    remains negative. This paper address how to draw inference about
    treatment effects when sputum cultures are intermittently missing
    on some patients. We discuss inference under a novel benchmark
    assumption and under a class of assumptions indexed by a
    treatment-specific sensitivity parameter that quantify departures
    from the benchmark assumption. We motivate and illustrate our
    approach using data from a randomized trial comparing the
    effectiveness of two treatments for adult TB patients in Brazil.

    nInterviews and focus groups with University of Washington
    researchers revealed a need across disciplines for simple and
    scalable data management. In response, the UW eScience Institute
    has developed SQLShare, a software-as-a-service platform for
    lightweight data manipulation, query, and sharing. SQLShare is
    designed to significantly reduce the effort required to build,
    maintain, and exploit a database management system by reducing
    operation to a simple Upload-Query-Share workflow: researchers
    upload data directly through a browser, then write queries to
    clean and process their data, link it with other sources, and
    analyze the results process, restructure, and analyze the results,
    then share their queries with other users for collaboration and
    publication purposes. Even researchers with zero programming
    experience are able to self-train in using SQL and SQLShare with
    only a few examples to get them started. The architecture is
    entirely cloud-based to ease dministration, with components
    running on both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. SQLShare
    supports hundreds of users on and off the UW campus, and is
    available for public use. SQLShare is also positioned as an
    exemplar in technology transfer: it was conceived and funded as a
    research project, co-developed by central IT and Computer Science
    researchers, and support is in the process of being incorporated
    into UW's suite of permanent campus services.

    In this talk, I'll present our work on SQLShare and describe our
    roadmap for the future.

    With modern "Big Data" settings, off-the-shelf statistical machine
    learning methods are frequently proving insufficient. A key
    challenge posed by these modern settings is that the data might
    have a large number of features, in what we will call "Big-p"
    data, to denote the fact that the dimension "p" of the data is
    large, potentially even larger than the number of samples. It is
    now well understood that estimation with strong statistical
    guarantees is still possible under such high-dimensional settings
    provided we impose suitable structure on the model
    space. Accordingly, a strong and large body of work over the last
    decade on high-dimensional statistical inference has studied
    models with various types of structure (e.g. sparse vectors;
    block-structured matrices; low-rank matrices; and Markov
    assumptions). A general approach to estimation under such settings
    is to use a regularized M-estimator which combines a loss
    function, measuring goodness-of-fit of the models to the data,
    with some regularization function that encourages the assumed
    structure. In this talk, we discuss a unified framework for
    estimation of general structurally constrained high-dimensional
    models, where we establish consistency and convergence rates for
    any regularized M-estimation procedure under high-dimensional
    scaling given any underlying model structure.  We state one main
    theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive several existing
    results, and also to obtain several new results on consistency and
    convergence rates. Finally, we will discuss an even further
    generalization of our analysis for the estimation of statistical
    models with general "heterogeneous" structures that are
    superpositions of homogeneous structures such as sparse,
    block-sparse and so on: thus providing a very broadly applicable
    toolkit for structured high-dimensional statistical estimation.

    Social science datasets are often in the form of matrices or
    arrays, potentially having correlations along each set of data
    indices. For example, data involving repeated measurements of
    several variables over time may exhibit temporal correlation as
    well as correlation among the variables. Social networks and other
    relational datasets may exhibit correlation among the senders and
    receivers of relationships. In this talk I will discuss a class of
    statistical models for the analysis of such array-valued
    data. Specifically, I will extend the matrix normal model for
    matrix-valued data to a class of array normal distributions having
    separable covariance structure. We relate this model to the
    higher-order SVD for analysis of array data, and show how the
    model can be motivated in terms of a latent variable
    representation. Model fitting and parameter estimation for
    array-normal distributions will be illustrated in the analysis of
    several examples, including international trade networks,
    imputation for nation specific life-tables, and estimation of
    high-order interactions in ANOVA models.

    Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) are useful for modelling how
    decision-makers should act in order to achieve their goals. To
    estimate an optimal DTR for a particular task, one typically makes
    the simplifying assumption that the goal of the decision-maker is
    to optimize the expectation of a scalar-valued outcome, for
    example symptom level or side-effect burden or some fixed
    combination of these that reflects the decision-maker's
    preferences. Furthermore, one also assumes when estimating the
    optimal action for a given time-point that the decision-maker will
    act optimally in the future. We will discuss how these two
    assumptions are related and describe a practical algorithm for
    weakening the assumptions in order to produce a decision support
    system that is more realistic. Our motivating application is
    clinical decision support, where the presence of different
    competing objectives can make both assumptions unreasonable.

    Over the past four decades, the prevalence of autism has risen

    A recent study using Heckman-type selection models to adjust for
    non-response in the Zambia 2007 Demographic and Health Survey
    (DHS) found a large correction in HIV prevalence for males. We aim
    to validate this finding, replicate the adjustment approach in
    other DHSs, apply the adjustment approach in an external empirical
    context, and assess the robustness of the technique to different
    adjustment approaches. We used 5 DHSs, and an HIV prevalence study
    from rural South Africa to validate and replicate the adjustment
    approach. We also developed an alternative, systematic model of
    selection processes and applied it to all surveys. We decomposed
    corrections from both approaches into rate change and
    age-structure change components. We are able to reproduce the
    adjustment approach for the 2007 Zambia DHS and derive results
    comparable with the original findings. We are able to replicate
    applying the approach in several other DHSs . The approach also
    yields reasonable adjustments for a survey in rural South
    Africa. The technique is relatively robust to how the adjustment
    approach is specified.

    Humans are superlative when it comes to obtaining information,
    both socially and asocially. Evolutionary theory concerning human
    culture predicts innate heuristic rules to help optimize the
    transmission and intake of correct information. These rules
    include learning from individuals perceived as prestigious,
    successful, or similar to you. Most research in this field is
    theoretical; with few studies empirically testing the hypotheses
    that arise from evolutionary models. In this talk, I will present
    ongoing research applying exponential random graph models to
    empirically test these theories of cultural transmission in large
    undergraduate classrooms. The use of longitudinal social network
    data to test these theories is a novel approach, and the
    collection from a large undergraduate classroom has proven to be a
    fruitful method. The methods are demonstrated on a study of 200
    undergraduate biology students. Additionally, a larger follow-up
    study that included the collection of social learning biomarkers

    For more than 50 years, researchers have rated legislators' effectiveness
    by whether the bills they sponsor make it out of committee   or into law. The
    goal of this project is to study the progress of   legislators' policy ideas
    rather than bills, based upon the common   observations that very few bills become
    law (only about 4%) and that the   substance of bills evolves as they move through
    the lawmaking process.   To identify policy ideas, we use text reuse methods from
    computer   science to compare the similarity of bill sections. Sections that exceed   a
    threshold of similarity are assumed to be the same idea. We then   trace the progress
    of ideas, as opposed to bills, through the process to   investigate important
    questions about lawmaking.

    Recent discoveries have led to renewed hope for making major
    inroads into HIV epidemics, including pre-exposure prophylaxis,
    early treatment as prevention, and more sensitive HIV tests. The
    relative cost-effectiveness of these interventions will depend on
    the contexts in which transmission events are currently occurring,
    a topic currently subject to strong debate. In this work, my
    colleagues and I sought to estimate the proportions of
    transmissions occurring in main vs. casual partnerships, and by
    the sexual role, infection stage, and testing and treatment
    history of the infected partner, for men who have sex with men
    (MSM) in the US and Peru. To represent observed sexual networks,
    we use a pair of linked exponential random graph models (ERGMs),
    one cross-sectional and one temporal, each parametrized by
    multiple large-scale MSM surveys. This approach reveals a number
    of novel statistical and computational issues for ERGMs, which we
    discuss. We interpret our results in the context of existing
    estimates, and their implications for prevention strategies.

    Westminster systems feature a strong government and a weak
    opposition, but the origins of this arrangement--the tacit
    acquiesence to reduced minority rights by non-government parties
    in the late 19th Century House of Commons--present a profound
    puzzle to researchers. We argue that oppositions voluntarily
    surrendered initiation and amendment rights, making parliamentary
    business more efficient for governments, in exchange for more
    certain opportunities to hold cabinet ministers to account. We
    gather a new data set comprising half-a-million parliamentary
    speeches and biographical information on over 8000 MPs to
    investigate our claims. We estimate the parameters of a novel

    Research about social behavioral adaptation to climate change
    struggles with assessing covariation because the empirical
    requirements of matching social and environmental evidence
    necessitates both temporal depth and spatial variability. Most
    assessments are limited in terms of environment measures, social
    measures, and temporal depth that might capture the long term
    shifts in climate-related weather patterns. Our study employs
    longitudinal data from Thailand about migration over a 16-year
    period and matches it with remote sensing satellite information
    about vegetative health, to capture exposure to drought stress. We
    measure the environmental variability across the landscape and
    across time using Fraley and Raftery's (2002) clustering
    approach. Our initial results are very promising and we are
    seeking insights about how best to improve our measures of climate
    variability, especially after having just completed some ground
    truthing fieldwork in March 013.

    Why do some visual stimuli look random and others more like a
    pattern? Conventional wisdom suggests that repeating, alternating,
    or symmetrical arrangements of features play a role in the
    perception of a pattern, but this evidence is often subjective and
    anecdotal. We aimed to more precisely characterize the factors
    that lead to the perception of randomness and pattern-ness
    starting with a simple set of visual stimuli: five-element
    sequences of horizontal and vertical Gabor patches arranged in a
    vertical column.

    In our main experiment, we administered a two-alternative
    forced-choice task to subjects via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
    platform. On each trial, subjects chose which of two presented
    sequences appeared most random. Subjects made over 10,000
    behavioral responses across all 496 possible pairings of the 32
    possible sequences. We then fit the results with a simple
    quantitative model that projects each sequence onto a single
    dimension that ranges from perceived randomness to perceived
    pattern-ness. We found that by using only a few objective,
    calculable descriptions of the stimuli, we could predict the
    subjects’ choice data with extremely high accuracy and
    reliability. Specifically, we found that (1) low entropy, (2) a
    low probability of alternation, and (3) a lack of symmetry all
    contribute systematically to the likelihood that one stimulus will
    appear more like a pattern than another.

    We then show that the model generalizes very well to both longer
    and more abstractly represented stimulus sequences. Since our
    model can predict the perceived randomness or pattern-ness of any
    binary sequence, we also demonstrate an interesting application:
    given a binary sequence with a subset of pre-specified elements,
    we can fill in the remaining elements to produce a sequence that
    will appear either maximally random or maximally patterned to a
    typical human observer.

    There are signs that fertility in rich countries may have stopped
    declining, but this depends critically on whether women currently
    in reproductive ages are postponing or reducing lifetime
    fertility. Analysis of average completed family sizes requires
    forecasts of remaining fertility for women born 1970-1995. We
    propose a Bayesian model for fertility that incorporates a priori
    information about patterns over age and time. We use data for 35
    countries to construct improper priors that give high weight to
    historically plausible rate surfaces. In the age dimension, cohort
    schedules should be well approximated by principal components of
    historical schedules. In the time dimension, series should be
    smooth and approximately linear over short spans. We calibrate
    priors so that approximation residuals have theoretical
    distributions similar to historical data. Our priors use quadratic
    penalties and imply a high-dimensional normal posterior
    distribution for each country’s fertility surface. Forecasts for
    cohorts currently 15-44 show consistent patterns. In the US,
    Northern Europe, and Western Europe, slight rebounds in completed
    fertility are likely. In East Asia and Central and Southern Europe
    there is little evidence for a rebound. Our methods could be
    applied to other forecasting and missing-data problems with only
    minor modifications.

    Analysis of incomplete data requires assumptions about the
    mechanism that divides the complete sample into its observed and
    missing parts. When two different types of missing values occur in
    the same data set, one should also consider the process that
    partitions the missing data into the two groups. In this
    presentation, I extend Rubin's (1976) concept of missing at
    random to two sets of missing values, describing conditions under
    which the missing-data processes may be completely or partially
    ignored. Multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987) may be carried out in
    two stages, allowing us to measure rates of missing information
    due to each type of missing value.  For illustration, I apply
    these concepts and techniques to several data Examples.

    The usefulness of generative models for complex networks is felt
    in many different disciplines, including psychology, biology,
    education and business, as a means of capturing important
    considerations in how individual units interact. Choosing the
    appropriate model family for such a network, or a series of
    networks, is a more difficult task, particularly as the complexity
    of these models increases. To make this task both theoretically
    clear and practical to execute, I expand the existing family of
    network models into a single family that allows for both the
    specification of multiple networks, the combination of multiple
    types of dependence structure, and clean model selection using in-
    and out-sample methods. I demonstrate these methods on several
    network data sets using our software in development.

    This paper makes two main contributions to inference for
    conditional quantiles. First, we construct a generic confidence interval
    for a conditional quantile from any given estimator of the conditional
    quantile via the direct approach. Our generic confidence interval makes
    use of two estimates of the conditional quantile function evaluated at
    two appropriately chosen quantile levels. In contrast to the standard
    Wald type confidence interval, ours circumvents the need to estimate the
    conditional density function of the dependent variable given the
    covariate. We show that our new confidence interval is asymptotically
    valid for any quantile function (parametric, nonparametric, or
    semiparametric), any conditional quantile estimator (standard kernel,
    local polynomial or sieve estimates), and any data structure (random
    samples, time series, or censored data), provided that certain weak
    convergence of the conditional quantile process holds for the
    preliminary quantile estimator. In the same spirit, we also construct a
    generic confidence band for the conditional quantile function across a
    range of covariate values. Second, we use a specific estimator, the
    Yang-Stute (also known as the symmetrized k-NN) estimator for a
    nonparametric quantile function, and two popular semiparametric quantile
    functions to demonstrate that oftentimes by a judicious choice of the
    quantile estimator combined with the specific model structure, one may
    further take advantage of the flexibility and simplicity of the direct
    approach. For instance, by using the Yang-Stute estimator, we construct
    confidence intervals and bands for a nonparametric and two
    semiparametric quantile functions that are free from additional
    bandwidth choices involved in estimating not only the conditional but
    also the marginal density functions and that are very easy to implement.
    The advantages of our new confidence intervals are borne out in a
    simulation study.

    In this talk we show how the limiting behavior of large
    networks can be exploited for nonparametric statistical inference. We
    introduce the notion of a network histogram, obtained by fitting a
    stochastic blockmodel to a single observation of a network dataset.
    Blocks of edges play the role of histogram bins, and community sizes
    that of histogram bandwidths or bin sizes. Working within the framework
    of exchangeable arrays subject to bond percolation, we prove consistency
    of network histogram estimation under general conditions, giving rates
    of convergence which include the important practical setting of sparse
    networks. Joint work with David Choi (http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4093)

    Fraud and irregularities plague elections in developing
    democracies. Over the past twenty-five years, the international
    community has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on election
    observation missions, but little robust evidence exists that they
    consistently increase electoral integrity. We conducted a randomized
    controlled trial to detect and deter electoral irregularities employing
    a nation-wide sample of polling stations in Uganda and using scalable
    information and communications technology (ICT). In treatment stations,
    researchers delivered letters to polling center managers stating that
    their tallies would be photographed using smartphones and compared
    against official results. Compared to control stations with no letters,
    the letters (i) increased the frequency of posted tallies by polling
    center manager in compliance with the electoral law; (ii) decreased the
    number of sequential digits found on tallies -- a fraud indicator; and
    (iii) decreased the vote share for incumbent President Museveni, the
    incumbent candidate most likely to benefit from rigging. Our results
    demonstrate the possibility that a cost-effective citizen and ICT-based
    intervention can improve electoral integrity in emerging democracies.

    Growing research agendas that examine insurgent alliance formation
    and
    fragmentation build on a bargaining model framework and emphasize the
    importance of credible commitments. While some scholars have started to
    identify some of the limitations of this model, few studies have
    evaluated the importance of ideas and identities in explaining insurgent
    group behavior during armed conflict. In this study we use insurgent
    rhetoric to generate quantitative measures for group conflict frames and
    targeting policies and examine how they relate to inter-group
    cooperation. Conflict frames serve as a gauge of insurgent social
    identities in terms of their in/out-group classifications and targeting
    policies reflect their declared attitudes concerning the legitimate
    targets of violence. We use these variables to investigate tie formation
    processes in two distinct networks obtained from insurgent rhetoric --
    joint operations and joint statements -- across three time periods in
    the Iraqi insurgency. We predict cooperative ties between Sunni
    insurgent groups using an exponential random graph model (ERGM) where
    tie values indicate the number of interactions between groups and
    conflict frames and targeting policies are nodal attributes. ERGMs offer
    the advantage of capturing both endogenous structural effects of the
    networks and exogenous actor attributes. We find that the strength of
    homophily effects varies over time and by network type and interpret
    these results in relation to the circumstances of the Iraqi insurgency.

    In this paper we investigate the contemporaneous and lead-lag
    relationship between two types of U.S. business cycle asymmetry pointed
    out in the literature: Infrequent large negative shocks that have
    permanent effects, modeled as shifts in the growth rate of trend from
    boom to recession and infrequent large negative shocks having only
    transitory effects, modeled as peak-reverting deviations from trend. We
    incorporate both types of asymmetry into a model of real GNP and
    consumption in which consumption anchors the trend. We find that a model
    that allows for the trend and transitory type asymmetry to be correlated
    is preferred to a model that assumes independence. In particular, the
    parameter estimates suggest a specific pattern of recessions: Shifts in
    trend growth rate lead both the appearance of large negative shocks to
    the transitory component when entering recessions and their disappearance
    when leaving recessions.

    Do good jobs or occupations result in better physical and
    mental health? Having a particular occupation - such as dishwasher, legal
    secretary, X-ray technician, or high school teacher - determines a host
    of conditions that in turn could affect one's health. Such conditions
    include stress, exposure to hazardous materials, physical exertion,
    wages, prestige, and intellectual engagement. Thus, a crucial question
    concerns how to develop measures of occupations that capture the complex
    conditions that are relevant to health. For example, does a simple
    classification of occupations into "white collar" and "blue collar" jobs
    capture the relevant dimensions of occupations that affect health
    outcomes? This project asks how conclusions about the impact of
    occupation on health are affected by the way in which occupation is
    measured and operationalized in empirical analyses.

    Networks are a form of  "relational data".  Relational
    data arise in many social science fields and graph
    models are a natural approach to representing the
    structure of these relations.  This framework has many
    applications including, for example, the structure
    of social networks, the behavior of epidemics, the
    interconnectedness of the WWW, and long-distance
    telephone calling patterns.

    We review stochastic models for such graphs, with
    particular focus on sexual and drug use networks.
    Commonly used Markov models were introduced by Frank
    and Strauss (1986) and were derived from developments
    in spatial statistics (Besag 1974). These models
    recognize the complex dependencies within relational
    data structures.

    To date, the use of graph models for networks
    has been limited by three interrelated factors:
    the complexity of realistic models, lack of use of
    simulation studies, and a poor understanding of the
    properties of inferential methods.  In this talk we
    discuss these factors and the degeneracy of commonly
    promoted models. We also review the role of Markov
    Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for simulation
    and likelihood-based inference.

    These ideas are applied to a sexual relations and
    IV drug networks from Colorado Springs with the
    objective of understanding the social determinants
    of HIV spread.

    Two phase or double sampling was introduced by Neyman as a
    technique for drawing efficient stratified samples. We consider such
    designs primarily for the case of a binary outcome variable. When strata
    and phase two sampling fractions depend both on outcome and covariates,
    care must be taken with the analysis of data from the resulting biased
    sample. The standard survey sampling (Horvitz-Thompson) approach involves
    weighting the log-likelihood contributions by the inverse sampling
    fractions. Only recently have "nonparametric maximum likelihood" (NPMLE)
    procedures become available (Scott and Wild 1997, Breslow and Holubkov
    1997). Large sample theory for the NPMLE procedures confirms that they
    have a semiparametric efficient influence function and achieve the
    information bounds derived by Robins, Hsieh and Newey (1995).

    Using data from the National Wilms Tumor Study, and simulations based on
    these data, we demonstrate the advantages of careful selection of the
    phase two sample and use of an efficient analysis method. The basic
    principles include: (i) fine stratification of the phase one sample using
    outcome and available covariates; (ii) selection of a ``balanced'' rather
    than a simple case-control sample at phase two; and (iii) estimation via
    non-parametric maximum likelihood. Double sampling in the context of
    survival analysis leads to the exposure stratified case-cohort design
    considered by Borgan, Langholz, Samuelsen and Goldstein (2000). See also
    Lin (2000). Simulations based on the Wilms tumor data confirm that
    strategies (i) and (ii) are advantageous also in this context.

    In many two-sided matching markets,
    an actor's available choices are limited by both
    the preferences of other actors in the system and
    information about the possible choices.
    In a job market, for example, the jobs available
    to a particular worker may be constrained by the
    preferences of the jobs for certain types of workers,
    by other workers occupying desired jobs, and knowledge
    about the availability of jobs.

    We discuss the analysis of matching data coming from such markets,
    in which the data consist of characteristics of pairs of
    individuals, with one individual from each of two distinct
    populations (for example workers and jobs, or men and women in a
    marriage market).  Our model for such data is based on Logan,
    Hoff, and Newton's (1999) parametric version of the two-sided
    matching model described in Roth and Sotomayer (1990), although we
    allow for the possibility that not all actors have information
    about one another. This extension may be useful when modeling
    markets in which the choices available to an individual are
    limited by geographic location or other constraints.

    Why do nations go to war? The study of war in both national and
    temporal contexts occurs at the intersection of two important scholarly
    concerns. The first is the broader question of how geography is a
    component of world politics. The second is the question of how to model
    political processes that vary both across nations and across time. Little
    research has capitalized on recent advances in statistical modeling of
    spatial processes developed by statisticians. Ward, Heagerty, and
    Gleditsch will analyze data on all international conflicts since 1800 and
    on the type of governing institutions in each country during this period.
    They will use novel statistical methods to model temporal context.

    Species inventories that list of all species present in a given area
    are
    an important tool for both the study of bio-diversity and conservation
    biology. These lists are typically obtained from fields studies in which
    biologists record all the species they can observed over a finite time
    period.  Because of the possible presence of rare, and thus hard to
    observe species, completeness of such lists can never be guaranteed,
    regardless of the amount of time and energy spent in compiling them.  A
    natural question hence is:  How much longer do I need to search until I
    observe a species I have not yet seen.

    For conservation biologists, these predictions provide a measure of the
    quality of an inventory by quantifying the diminishing return of continued
    sampling to increase the completeness of the list.  For software engineer,
    they serve as a measure of quality of the software under development by
    quantifying the time that given software may run before encountering an
    unforeseen new bug.  Bounds on the time to the next discovery are also
    important in the context of sequential inventorying, for which they help
    determine reasonable stopping rules.

    In my talk, I will present a methodology for obtaining lower bounds for
    the time of the next discovery without specification of the distribution
    of the capture probabilities.  For this, I will need to look at the
    statistical properties of estimates of estimates for the expected value of
    the last observation of a sequence of random variables with increasing
    means.

    Missing data can lead to bias and inefficiency in estimating the
    quantities of interest in scientific studies.
    This can be especially problematic in longitudinal studies which measure
    the same subjects at several different points in time. We consider the
    Bayesian approach to drawing inferences in structural
    equation models with missing data. The Bayesian approach and algorithms
    for performing the required calculations are described. An example from
    the Iowa Youth and Families Project (IYFP) being carried out
    at the Institute for Social and Behavioral Research at Iowa State
    University is used to illustrate the approach. Tools for assessing fit
    when Bayesian methods are used are also described.

    Hierarchical probability models are commonly used to estimate small-area
    disease-morbidity or disease-mortality rates. From the resulting
    estimates it is often desirable to identify small areas (e.g., counties)
    with unusually high or low disease risk after accounting for known risk
    factors. Traditional estimates of the unexplained risk are based on the
    squared-error loss function; such estimates have good ensemble properties
    but may be suboptimal for some features of the distribution of risk
    parameters. We explore the
    use of alternative loss functions to derive improved estimates of extreme
    values. A disease mapping application is used to illustrate the approach.
    A simulation study is used to compare the different loss functions.

    A problem raised in studying the etiology of colon cancer is to
    understand whether rats that have elevated adduct levels in particular
    crypt positions in distal region also have elevated levels in the same
    crypt positions in proximal region, and whether this relationship depends
    on diet. We cast this problem as estimating the correlation function of
    two responses as a function of a covariate for studies where both
    responses are measured on the same experimental units but not the same
    subsampling units. Parametric and nonparametric methods are developed and
    applied to a data set from an ongoing study, leading to potentially
    important and surprising biological results. Theoretical calculations
    suggest that the nonparametric method, based on nonparametric regression,
    should in fact have statistical properties nearly the same as if the
    functions nonparametrically estimated were known. The methodology used in
    this
    paper can be applied to other settings when the goal of the study is to
    model the correlation of two continuous repeated measurement responses as
    a function of a covariate, while the two responses of
    interest can be measured on the same experimental units but not on the
    same subsampling units. In our example, the two responses were measured
    in two different regions of the colon.

    A number of different approaches exist for comparing and selecting
    statistical models, each with its own assumptions, emphases and definitions
    on what model selection actually means. This talk gives first a review of
    the most important of such approaches: significance tests, lack-of-fit
    indices, Bayesian model  selection, AIC and related criteria, and
    cross-validation and other predictive criteria. The role of simplicity of
    models in some of the approaches is then explored in more detail. Several
    model selection quantities (such as the well-known BIC and AIC statistics)
    are expressed as penalized criteria which appear to express a trade-off
    between the fit of a model and its complexity. An interpretation of the
    penalty term in such criteria can provide insight into the concept of
    simplicity of models and why simple models are generally desirable. It also
    helps to understand differences between different penalized criteria. The
    approaches are illustrated using models for comparisons of patterns of
    social mobility across nations.

    Growing research agendas that examine insurgent alliance formation
    and fragmentation build on a bargaining model framework and
    emphasize the importance of credible commitments. While some
    scholars have started to identify some of the limitations of this
    model, few studies have evaluated the importance of ideas and
    identities in explaining insurgent group behavior during armed
    conflict. In this study we use insurgent rhetoric to generate
    quantitative measures for group conflict frames and targeting
    policies and examine how they relate to inter-group
    cooperation. Conflict frames serve as a gauge of insurgent social
    identities in terms of their in/out-group classifications and
    targeting policies reflect their declared attitudes concerning the
    legitimate targets of violence. We use these variables to
    investigate tie formation processes in two distinct networks
    obtained from insurgent rhetoric -- joint operations and joint
    statements -- across three time periods in the Iraqi
    insurgency. We predict cooperative ties between Sunni insurgent
    groups using an exponential random graph model (ERGM) where tie
    values indicate the number of interactions between groups and
    conflict frames and targeting policies are nodal attributes. ERGMs
    offer the advantage of capturing both endogenous structural
    effects of the networks and exogenous actor attributes. We find
    that the strength of homophily effects varies over time and by
    network type and interpret these results in relation to the
    circumstances of the Iraqi insurgency.

    With the advent of cheap and reliable Internet survey panels
    we have seen a resurgence in the use of the survey list experiment for indirectly
    asking respondents about sensitive topics. We have also seen the introduction
    of new estimators for list experiment data, most notably the ICT regression model
    (Imai, 2011). This estimator promises to extract more from the data -- and more
    efficiently -- than traditional difference-in-means analysis but it leans heavily
    on assumptions about responses at the extremes (admitting to none or all items
    on the list) to identify the model. This presentation shows how measurement problems
    in these extreme responses can induce severe bias in parameter and population-prevalence
    estimates. I document how such problems may arise in practice and reports the
    results of Monte Carlo experiments examining the sensitivity of these estimators
    to both random and extreme-biased respondent error. I find that ICT regression
    is very sensitive to extreme-biased measurement error relative to simple t-tests
    and its generalizations whereas random measurement error makes little difference
    (other than a loss of effciency). This bias becomes more extreme as the underlying
    prevalence of the sensitive item decreases. I propose some simple solutions to
    this problem at the design stage including the randomization of the ordering of
    presentation of the possible responses (in addition to the items in the list),
    turning systematic into random measurement error but likely reducing the effciency
    of the list experiment.

    In the practice of program evaluation, choosing the covariates and
    the functional form of the propensity score is an important choice
    for estimating treatment effects.  This paper proposes data-driven
    model selection and model averaging procedures that address this
    issue for the propensity score weighting estimation of the average
    treatment effects for treated (ATT).  Building on the focussed
    information criterion (FIC), the proposed selection and averaging
    procedures aim to minimize the estimated mean squared error (MSE)
    of the ATT estimator in a local asymptotic framework. We formulate
    model averaging as a statistical decision problem in a limit
    experiment, and derive an averaging scheme that is Bayes optimal
    with respect to a given prior for the localisation parameters in
    the local asymptotic framework. In our Monte Carlo studies, the
    averaging estimator outperforms the post-covariate-selection
    estimator in terms of MSE, and shows a substantial reduction in
    MSE compared to conventional ATT estimators.  We apply the
    procedures to evaluate the effect of the labor market program
    described in LaLonde (1986).

    Every year, 8.7 million people worldwide contract tuberculosis
    (TB) and over 16% of them will die from it. Multi-drug resistant
    TB is a growing concern because it takes 4 times as long and is
    over 200 times more expensive to cure than drug-susceptible
    TB. Drug resistance testing is costly and few developing countries
    have routine surveillance systems to measure drug resistance rates
    and monitor trends. Though South Africa contributes
    disproportionately to worldwide increases in drug resistance it
    does not perform routine surveillance and its most recent
    surveillance survey data come from 2002 (a current surveillance
    study is ongoing). This study investigates the viability of using
    routinely collected TB test result data to estimate underlying
    drug resistance rates in the population of patients with suspected
    TB in South Africa.  It employs a tuberculosis test result
    database collected by the National Health Laboratory Service
    (NHLS) which includes detailed TB test results and drug
    sensitivity testing data for over 37 million tuberculosis tests
    and 14 million patients between 2001-2011, representing
    approximately 85% of all TB tests performed annually in South
    Africa. A combination of factors related to patient history,
    physician decision-making and health service resource availability
    determine which of the patients with suspected TB are tested for
    drug resistance. "Naive" estimates of drug resistance that do not
    correct for sample selection into drug resistance testing are
    unlikely to produce unbiased estimates of drug resistance. This
    study evaluates the viability of three propensity score methods
    (reweighting, matching and a control function) to address the
    sample selection issue in the South African context, and compares
    estimates to "naive" estimates.

    The talk addresses possible characteristics of measures of
    association among k binary variables. There are various measures of association
    proposed in the literature, but the most often used one is the odds ratio, which
    plays a central role in log-linear models, most importantly, in various kinds
    of Markov models. But not every analyst is entirely satisfied with this choice.
    In particular, lack of collapsibility is often cited as an undesirable property.
    The fact that even the direction of association may change after collapsing, is
    seen as paradoxical by many, as shown by the huge literature on "Simpson's paradox".
    Directional collapsibility means, that such a reversal cannot occur.

    While odds ratios are not directionally collapsible, they are variation independent
    from lower dimensional marginals, which is usually considered a very desirable
    property when measuring association. The talk raises the question, whether there
    is a measure of association for k-dimensional binary distribution, which is both
    directionally collapsible and variation independent from lower dimensional marginals.

    The answer is negative, at least, when two very simple assumptions, which seem
    reasonable if the variables indicate the presence or lack of characteristics,
    are made. Variation independence from the lower dimensional marginals implies
    that the direction of association, for every distribution, is the same as the
    direction found by the odds ratio, thus there is no directional collapsibility.
    On the other hand, every directionally collapsible measure of association gives
    the same direction of association as a simple contrast of the cell probabilities
    does.

    Thus, when data analysts choose a measure (= concept) of association, they cannot
    hope to have both variation independence from the lower dimensional marginals
    and directional collapsibility.

    Background: Research evidence is a valuable input into health
    policy decision-making processes; a consensus exists that research
    evidence can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
    policy-making. Yet, research evidence is not commonly used for
    reasons relating to the evidence itself, perceptions of the user,
    and that it competes with other inputs in policy-making. Previous
    studies have identified the positive effect of interpersonal
    relationships between research producers and users on the use of
    evidence in policy-making. This study thus adopts a social network
    lens in order to describe the determinants of evidence exchange by
    actors in policy networks, whether those exchanges, or other
    factors, predict evidence use by individual policy actors, and
    whether dyadic exchange and nodal use translate to the use of
    research evidence by the network to inform the resulting policy
    decision.

    Methods: In-depth interviews and social network surveys provided
    data for three health policy networks and their recent policy
    decisions in Burkina Faso. Social network methods were used to map
    and describe these multiplex networks, and exponential random
    graph models were built to explain determinants of evidence
    exchange, controlling for structural and individual-level
    covariates.

    Findings: The frequency of evidence exchange varied across policy
    issues, and actors were more likely to provide, rather than
    request, evidence. Exchange was better predicted by structural
    variables in ERGMs, including entrainment and transitivity, than
    by individual attributes. An actor's use of evidence was
    positively associated with their degree centrality; however,
    dyadic and nodal exchange and/or use did not necessarily translate
    to instrumental use by the aggregate network, hinting at the other
    social processes at play in policy choice. These findings will be
    explored in detail in order to suggest a research agenda for
    network interventions to support evidence use in policy-making.

    Investigating the exchange of goods in any society can provide
    insights into a range of social factors such as migration
    patterns, trade networks and social hierarchy.For archaeological
    research, exchange can be difficult to recognize among people who
    lived in the past as it is not always clear where an artifact was
    originally produced.In recent decades, archaeological research on
    exchange has increasingly relied on the use of geological sourcing
    methods in order to infer the movement or exchange of stone tools
    and pottery remains.In order to investigate the movement of these
    common artifact types, archaeologists use a combination of
    multivariate statistical methods in order to infer the location of
    geologic origin and compare this with the location of
    archaeological recovery.While these statistical methods are useful
    when strong clustering exists in the data, they are far less
    beneficial when higher variability within geochemical data is
    present.Using compositional data from pottery sherds recovered in
    the Kuril Islands of the Russian Far East, this talk reviews the
    multivariate data analysis methodology for geologic sourcing
    methods as currently practiced by the archaeological community.In
    addition, the potential for incorporating archaeology recovery
    location data with geochemical signatures is explored as an aid
    for identifying the location where artifacts originated.The goal
    of this seminar is to not only present this unique archaeological
    and statistical problem but also get to gather feedback concerning
    alternative solutions to this issue.

    Randomized trials and observational studies are often used to
    answer the same causal questions in comparative effectiveness and
    safety research (CER). For example, the effects of statins and of
    postmenopausal hormone therapy on the risk of coronary heart
    disease have been estimated both using randomized clinical trials
    and observational studies. Randomized trials have traditionally
    been considered as the “gold standard” for clinical research. In
    CER, however, randomized trials are often not ideal. The typically
    long duration and pragmatic approach of post-approval CER trials
    may result in substantial noncompliance and loss to follow-up that
    render intention-to-treat estimates effectively useless. Because
    treatment choices and participation decisions after baseline are
    not randomized in neither randomized trials nor observational
    follow-up studies, time-varying confounding and selection bias may
    arise under both designs. As a result, CER trials may resemble
    more an observational study with baseline randomization than a
    classic pre-approval randomized clinical trial. Under this
    conceptualization of CER trials as follow-up studies with baseline
    randomization, the analysis of observational studies and
    randomized trials should be identical (except for baseline
    confounding adjustment), which is contrary to common
    practice. This talk reviews a common framework for the analysis of
    CER randomized trials and observational studies, and presents
    several applications for cardiovascular, renal, and infectious
    diseases.

    Standard models of labor supply predict that unearned income
    decreases labor supply. In contrast, we propose a noncooperative
    bargaining model in which a woman's unearned income improves her
    autonomy within the household, which raises her utility of working
    and can increase her labor supply. We find empirical support for
    this prediction, using the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) in India as
    a source of exogenous variation in a woman's unearned income. The
    HSA was phased in across states and over time, and applied only to
    Hindu women who were unmarried at the time of the reform. We
    estimate its effects using an instrumental variable strategy that
    uses variation in a woman's year of birth, religion and state to
    predict her exposure. We find that the HSA increased women's
    labor supply, particularly into jobs likely to be high-paying,
    such as jobs working for non-family members, earning cash, and
    that take place outside of the home. We argue that these results
    cannot be explained by changes in pre-marital human capital
    investments, marital matching, or selective migration.

    Divergent interests, expertise, and language form cultural
    barriers to communication. No formalism has been available to
    characterize these “cultural holes.” Here we use information
    theory to measure cultural holes and demonstrate our formalism in
    the context of scientific communication using papers from
    JSTOR. We extract scientific fields from the structure of citation
    flows and infer field-specific cultures by cataloging phrase
    frequencies in full text and measuring the relative efficiency of
    between-field communication. We then combine citation and cultural
    information in a novel topographic map of science, mapping
    citations to geographic distance and cultural holes to
    topography. By analyzing the full citation network, we find that
    communicative efficiency decays with citation distance in a
    field-specific way. These decay rates reveal hidden patterns of
    cohesion and fragmentation. For example, the ecological sciences
    are balkanized by jargon, whereas the social sciences are
    relatively integrated. Our results highlight the importance of
    enriching structural analyses with cultural data.

    Social media and Internet-based messaging systems are increasingly
    important platforms for risk communication. A global audience
    turns to these tools to seek, disseminate, and curate
    time-sensitive, event information during periods of
    crisis. Moreover, emergency responders report adopting these tools
    to augment their typical public information functions. Here, we
    use unsupervised machine learning methods and text analysis to
    explore online communications from a set of state and Federal
    emergency management-related organizations over a period of 15
    months. We compare communication during routine, non-event periods
    with communication during significant disaster events in order to
    evaluate differences in the roles these organizations
    play. Findings indicate that communications from emergency
    management organizations align based on functional roles during
    routine situations, but during crisis events communication
    strategies converge on a mutual objective. These results have
    important practical consequences for organizational learning
    within this environment and could inform social media policies for
    emergency responders.

    Scientists have long appreciated the relationship between the
    social environment and a multitude of individual
    behaviors. Understanding this relationship presents two
    statistical challenges: (i) interpretably representing network
    structure and (ii) linking local network structure to outcomes of
    interest. This talk explores these challenges in the context of
    multiview, continuous-time network data. We first present a latent
    space model for multiview networks, situations where multiple
    types of relations are observed for the same individuals. We then
    present preliminary work which develops a Bayesian sparse coding
    approach for capturing local structure in unstructured
    observational network data.

    The UN has recently issued official probabilistic population
    projections for all countries for the first time, based on
    Bayesian hierarchical models for fertility and mortality. I will
    describe an extension of the Bayesian hierarchical model that
    allows for probabilistic projection of aggregate TFR for any set
    of countries. We model the spatial correlation between country
    forecast errors as a function of time invariant covariates. This
    gives improved probabilistic forecasts for regional and other
    aggregates. Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of
    the correlation between forecast errors for TFR in different
    countries is due to countries' geographic proximity to one
    another, and that if this correlation is accounted for, the
    quality of probabilitistic projections of TFR for regions and
    other aggregates is improved. This is joint work with Bailey
    Fosdick.

    Graphical models provide a framework for understanding the
    relationships among random variables. In the high-dimensional setting in
    which there are many variables relative to the number of observations,
    learning the conditional dependence relationships among the variables is
    notoriously difficult. In contrast, marginal dependence relationships are
    typically much easier to detect and quantify. Of course, the marginal and
    conditional dependence relationships are often quite different.


    In this talk, I will consider a very simple question: in high dimensions
    and under multivariate normality, what price do we pay by considering the
    marginal dependence graph in settings where the conditional dependence
    graph is of interest? I will present a few lines of evidence in support of
    a simple claim: estimating the marginal dependence graph, and treating it
    as an estimate of the conditional dependence graph, might not be so bad.
    This talk is based on joint work with Jerry Friedman (Stanford), Noah Simon
    (UW), and Shikai Luo and Rui Song (NC State).'

  abstract: >-
    Latent ability models relate a set of observed variables to a set
    of latent ability variables. It includes the paired and multiple
    comparison models, the item response theory (IRT) models, etc. In
    this talk, first I will present an online Bayesian approximate
    method for online gaming analysis with paired and multiple
    comparison models. Experiments on game data show that accuracy of
    our online algorithm is competitive with a state of the art
    systems such as TrueSkill, but the running time as well as the
    code as much shorter. We also compare our method with Glicko
    rating system, designed for rating chess players. Next, I will
    give an extension of this Bayesian approach to IRT models with
    application to Internet ratings data. The proposed method is based
    on a variant of Stein's identity. I will also briefly describe how
    this identity can be applied to derive the Kalman gain.

  title: The Political Legacy of American Slavery
  url: https://www.csss.washington.edu/Seminars/archive/2015/spring/Seminar_08_Apr.shtml
  abstract: >-

    We show that contemporary difference in political attitudes across
    counties in the American South in part trace their origins to
    slavery's prevelance more than 150 years ago. Whites who currently
    live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in 1860
    are more likely to identify as a Republican, oppose affirmative
    action policies, and express racial resentment and colder feelings
    toward blacks. These results cannot be explained by existing
    theories, including the theory of contemporary racial threat. To
    explain these results, we offer evidence for a new theory
    involving the historical persistence of racial attitudes. We argue
    that, following the Civil War, Southern whites faced incentives to
    reinforce existing racist norms and institution to maintain
    political and economic control over the newly free
    African-American Population. This amplified local difference in
    racially conservative political attitudes, which in turn have been
    passed down locally across generations. Our results challenge the
    interpretation of a vast literature on racial attitudes in the
    American South. Work with Avidit Acharya and Matthew Blackwell.

    Accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a
    critical input to social science research and policy. In
    industrialized economies, novel sources of passively-collected
    data are enabling new approaches to population modeling and
    measurement. In developing countries, however, fewer sources of
    such .big data. exist. The notable exception is the mobile phone,
    which now has roughly 90% global penetration.

    In this paper, we show that an individual.s past history of phone
    use can be used to accurately infer his or her socioeconomic
    status. Combining a large database of mobile phone communication
    records with short follow-up surveys with 900 mobile phone
    subscribers, we find that a rich set of behavioral metrics derived
    from the phone data are highly predictive of the self-reported
    attributes of individual survey respondents. Using models trained
    on this sample of 900, we then predict the socioeconomic
    attributes of the entire population of several million mobile
    phone subscribers in a small country. These individual predictions
    can be geographically aggregated into maps that correspond very
    closely to official government statistics (R2=0.86), or used to
    impute the characteristics of micro-regions that are much smaller
    than the most fine-grained administrative units of the country. In
    resource-constrained environments where censuses and household
    surveys are rare, this creates an option for gathering timely
    information on population demographics at a tiny fraction of the
    cost of traditional methods.

    contravention of a state's established laws and conventions---for
    the first 6 months of 2015 using predictions from an ensemble of
    seven thematic models. The data consist of monthly observations
    for 168 countries worldwide from 1991 to 2015, including several
    aggregations of event data. Earlier version of this model have
    correctly predicted several coups (Thailand and Burkina Faso, most

  title: Old and new methods for benchmarking efficiency of health facilities
  date: 2015-04-29
  abstract: >- 

     A dictionary definition of efficiency is “the ability to do
     something or produce something without wasting materials, time,
     or energy”, and over forty years of research have gone into the
     development of mathematical and statistical methods for
     quantifying efficiency of decision-making units like health
     facilities.  I have recently had the opportunity to apply a range
     of these methods to benchmark the efficiency of hundreds of
     health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa, using data collected for
     the Access, Bottlenecks, Costs, and Equity (ABCE) project.
 
     This talk will describe the two major approaches to benchmarking,
     Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis
     (SFA), which were developed in the 1970s in the Operations
     Research and Econometrics communities respectively, and attempt
     to provide a unifying framework which can also take advantage of
     the vast increase in computational power over the last 40 years.
