Abstract
We present several approaches to modeling latent structure in longitudinal studies when the
covariance itself is the primary focus of the analysis. This is a departure from much of the
work on longitudinal data analysis, in which attention is focused solely on the cross-sectional
mean and the influence of covariates on the mean. Such analyses are particularly important in
policy-related studies, in which the heterogeneity of the population is of interest. We describe
several traditional approaches to this modeling and introduce a flexible, parsimonious class
of covariance models appropriate to such analyses. This class, while rooted in the tradition of
mixed effects and random coefficient models, merges several disparate modeling philosophies
into what we view as a hybrid approach to longitudinal data modeling. We discuss the
implications of this approach and its alternatives especially on model interpretation. We
compare several implementations of this class to more commonly employed mixed effects
models to describe the strengths and limitations of each. These alternatives are compared in
an application to long-term trends in wage inequality for young workers. The findings provide
additional guidance for the model formulation process in both statistical and substantive
senses.

Introduction and Motivation

An increasing number of social and behavioral science studies collect information from subjects at several points in time. These longitudinal studies enable researchers to study changes
in the phenomena of interest over the life-course of the subjects. At each observation time,
at least one response, such as wages earned or the occurrence of a meaningful event, such
as graduation from college, is recorded. As with regression, one may collect explanatory
covariates in the hope that differences in these inputs will be associated with different levels
of response. Each subject is thus associated with their own time series of responses and a
corresponding set of potentially time-varying explanatory covariates. Models for longitudinal
data attempt to relate those individual time series to an overall group process.
The focus on either individual or group processes plays a key role in how one models
longitudinal data. For example, if we are modeling a continuous response, Y , in terms of
explanatory covariates, X, then the familiar linear model, for individual i,
Yi = X i β +  i

(1)

could be adopted, but Yi and i would be ni -vectors, where ni is the number of observations
on individual i. Similarly, Xi would be of dimension ni × p, where p is the number of
explanatory covariates. Note that we are modeling a response vector, yet this distinction is
not made explicitly with our notation. Alternatively, the model may be written
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + i (t),
where the index t identifies a specific element of the response vector Yi . If we were to
proceed with a classical multiple regression, stacking the responses by individual and then
by observation within individual, we would obscure an important feature of longitudinal
data; namely, we know that some set of observations come from the same individual. And
observations within the same individual may be correlated due to unobserved individual
characteristics. To see this, let us return to the notation in (1), but now
Yi = Xi β + αi + ∗i ,

(2)

where αi is an unobserved scalar trait for subject i, and the residual variation is mean zero
and uncorrelated with the unobserved process, and E(∗i (t)∗i (t0 )) = 0 for t 6= t0 . Since we do
not observe αi , we tend to use (1) when the underlying process is accurately described by
(2), so the residual variation structure i is really αi + ∗i . The unobserved trait induces a
correlation within individual i, since
E(i (t)i (t0 )|αi ) = E((αi + ∗i (t))(αi + ∗i (t0 ))|αi ) = αi2 ,
1

and αi2 6= 0 in general. Note that the unobserved αi may not correspond to a single measurable characteristic; instead it proxies for all unobserved characteristics.
There are several different ways to think about the correlation structure in longitudinal
data. The different perspectives are induced by the nature of the unobserved trait and its
relationship to the covariates and residual variation. If substantive interest is on the effects
of the covariates on the response averaged over the population then models are usually
formulated for the mean response averaged over the unobserved traits. Broadly speaking, the
correlation structure is modeled as a nuisance parameter, and regression coefficients represent
population-average effects (Liang and Zeger 1986, Zeger and Liang 1986, Prentice 1988).
Alternatively, individual differences may be of interest, and can be modeled directly as latent
variables; for these individual-specific models, regression parameters are to be interpreted
conditionally on the value of the subject’s latent variable. We will discuss these different
approaches, certain variations thereof, and their implications in subsequent sections. Along
the way, we will introduce a class of models for longitudinal data that merges these two
approaches in a new hybrid form, which is conceptually linked to principal components
and factor analysis. First, we introduce the substantive problem that motivates this new
formulation.
In labor market economics, a rise in cross-sectional measures of wage inequality that
began in the 1970s and has persisted into the 1990s is well-documented (Levy and Murnane
1992; Danziger and Gottschalk 1993; McMurrer and Sawhill 1998). This means that there
are greater numbers of workers making more and less than ever before. And for many groups
of workers, wages have remained stagnant over time. This stagnation is due in part to a
disproportionate growth in the lower tail of the wage distribution. Using data from two
young adult cohorts in the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS), we find, for example, that
30-35 year old white men have a mean wage of $17.78 in 1979, while this figure is $14.27
per hour for a similarly aged group in 1992 (inflation adjusted, 1999 dollars). A measure of
inequality is the variance in outcomes; the variance of the logged wages increased 44% over
the same period.
This dramatic rise has prompted researchers to look more closely at trends in inequality
over the lifecourse of a worker. Cross-sectional data can document a rise in inequality,
but since each cross-section is a random sample from the population, one cannot conclude
that the same people are making the higher wages in each period. Statements such as
“the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer” cannot be definitively made.
But longitudinal data can be used to address this type of question. To couch this in labor
economic terms, we would like to examine two competing hypotheses that explain the growth
in inequality:
2

I. Wages have become more volatile
II. Wages have become more stratified over time, indicating a reduction in economic mobility
The scenarios are illustrated in Figures 1 - 3 below. Figure 1, represents an economy in
which individual “profiles” fan out over time, but not excessively. This is our stylized image
of a past economy; in Figures 2 and 3, we changed the covariance structure to reflect at
least a doubling of process variance, but we do this in very different ways. In Figure 2, the
structured variation has become more stratified, but the residual process is left unchanged.
In Figure 3, the structured variation is identical to that used in Figure 1, but the residual
variance of the process has been greatly increased. This last figure may seem exaggerated,
but the average variation between individuals is actually a bit smaller than in Figure 2.

Figure 3: Stylized wage trajectories for a more volatile economy
may be true and the differences may be more subtle. Each possibility has a different substantive interpretation, so sorting out the extent to which each hypothesis describes the changes
in wage structure is very important and will have different implications in terms of policy.
To investigate the two hypotheses, Bernhardt, et al. (1997), Gottshalk and Moffitt (1994),
Haider (1996) and Baker (1997) decompose the wage into permanent and transient components as follows. Let
w(t) = p(t) + u(t),

(3)

where w is the wage, p is its permanent portion, and u is a residual variation term, capturing
short-term, or transient variation. For a specific worker, p(t) can be thought of as their mean
wage at time t, with residual variation u(t). Assuming independence of p(t) and u(t), we
have that
Var(w(t)) = Var(p(t)) + Var(u(t)),
and the two hypotheses can be differentiated through this variance decomposition: a rise in
wage variance must involve a rise in at least one of the two variance components. Greater
stratification implies an increase in the first term, while greater volatility involves the second.
If we had a substantial number of observations for each individual, we could estimate p(t)
using separate regressions for each. The distribution of these predicted curves would represent permanent variation, while the residuals represent transient variation. The hypotheses
of interest describe differences in wage trajectories without any socioeconomic controls, so
the only explanatory covariates we include in this analysis are functions of time.
This last point warrants further explanation. Socioeconomic variables such as level of
schooling, parent’s education, and industry of employment, capture expected returns to
individual (supply-side) and employer (demand-side) characteristics. For example, there
may be changes in the mean return to obtaining a high school degree which reflects the
value of that set of skills in the labor market. Including socioeconomic covariates also
4

controls for compositional shifts in the labor market. The growth in a specific sector of the
economy could induce growing inequality if that sector is typically associated with lower
wages. But all of these explanations are necessarily focused on the permanent portion of the
wage trajectory, since volatility is associated with residual, rather than mean effects. The
first stage in any analysis of wage inequality is the accurate documentation of the growth in
inequality, and how it is apportioned with regard to permanent and transient components.
Thus, our focus is first on covariance structure, and not on the socioeconomic covariates that
might “explain” the structure.
In many longitudinal studies, there are a relatively small number of observations per individual, so estimating separate regressions to assess wage inequality is infeasible. A variance
components model (Searle, et al. 1992) using (3) can partition the variance into long-term,
permanent variation and short-term, transitory variation. We note that the distinction between long- and short-term trends is fundamentally about economic mobility. The variation
between the individuals’ permanent components is a measure of mobility relative to one’s
peers, and a variance components analysis allows one to evaluate this important economic
issue.
In matters with such strong policy implications, proper specification of a model that
describes the components of variation is crucial. What may be less apparent is the role
of the covariance structure in such an analysis. If we generalize the basic model (2) for
longitudinal data to allow for more complex individual characteristics, we get the standard
mixed effects model (Diggle, Liang and Zeger 1994),
Yi = X i β + Z i δ i +  i .

(4)

We have introduced a random effects component, Zi δi , in which Zi is an ni × q known design

matrix, and δi is a q-vector of unknown (latent) variables. It is often assumed that δi are
mean zero multivariate Gaussian. Under this assumption, it is seen that E(Yi ) = Xi β, while

E(Yi |δi ) = Xi β + Zi δi . This distinction is important. The latter approach asserts that
individuals differ from the population average response in a systematic manner, which is
dependent on some latent characteristics. In our application, the growth in wage inequality
and evidence for the two competing hypotheses are features of the latent process, Z i δi , not
the population-average process Xi β. If δi ∼ Nq (0, G) and i ∼ Nni (0, R), independently,
then

Cov(Yi (t), Yi (t0 )) = {Zi GZi0 + R}tt0 .
Note that the Xi β term is not included. In other words, the covariance structure of the
responses, rather than the mean structure, captures the nature of individual differences, and
thus inequality, in the labor market. Strictly speaking, the covariance structure captures all
5

extra-mean variation. Since for the mean we employ only time as an explanatory covariate,
all of the contributions to inequality are expressed in the covariance. This establishes a
baseline level of inequality that we can later use additional covariates (such as education) to
explain.
Models for this covariance structure that can differentiate between hypotheses 1 and 2
will be developed in subsequent sections.

1.1

Data

As alluded to above, we will anchor our presentation by using an example from labor market
economics, where proper modeling of covariance structure is of paramount importance. We
will be investigating two datasets from the NLS. The first, or original cohort, is a representative sample of young men aged 14-21 first interviewed in 1966 and interviewed annually for
the next fifteen years (with the exception of 1972, 1974, 1977 and 1979). The second dataset
began with a comparable sample of young men in 1979 who have been interviewed yearly
since then for fifteen additional years. For comparability between cohorts, we selected only
non-Hispanic whites, with resulting sample sizes of 2,614 and 2,373 respectively for the original and recent cohorts. For a detailed description of these datasets and their comparability,
see Bernhardt, et al. (1997). According to Topel and Ward (1992), “the first 10 years of a
career will account for 66 percent of lifetime wage growth for male high school graduates and
almost exactly the same fraction of lifetime job changes,” so it is important to understand
trends manifesting themselves in this early period.
In this paper, we present several different ways to model covariance structure with the
ultimate goal of addressing questions such as those posed in hypotheses 1 and 2. One of
these methods is novel in the literature, so it is be developed in some depth. We begin
by discussing several different philosophical perspectives to longitudinal data modeling in
Section 2. To address hypotheses like the ones just presented, we argue that a different
modeling philosophy is necessary; we develop a hybrid framework with this in mind in
Section 3 and illustrate it in Section 4. We apply more traditional models to our labor market
data in Section 5 and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including the
substantive implications of each choice. Section 6 summarizes the discussion and suggests
future directions of research.

2

Alternative Modeling Philosophies

The choice of modeling framework should depend on the substantive question of interest.
For example, in many medical applications, one may be focussed on how a treatment affects
6

the population as a whole. However, if there are potentially serious risks involved in treatment, the distribution of outcomes, including information about the extremes, may be of
importance. Along with many modeling paradigms comes a modeling philosophy, focussed
on the primary goals of the research. We now describe several philosophies in longitudinal
data modeling.

2.1

Population-average analysis

Population average models focus on describing the population, rather than individuals within
it. Much as in classical regression, the mean response is modeled conditional on the observed
covariates. In a linear model, E(Y |X) = Xβ, the parameter β describes how changes in
the components of X affect the overall population. With longitudinal data, we have seen
that the covariance of the responses within an individual influences the response trajectory.

For some problems, that covariance structure is effectively a nuisance parameter—it must be
included in the model but is of no intrinsic interest in and of itself. Generalized Estimating
Equations (GEE) is a methodology that produces consistent estimates of population-average
parameters even when the covariance structure is misspecified (Liang and Zeger 1986, Zeger
and Liang 1986, Prentice 1988). This technique allows one to pursue the population-average
approach to modeling, while accounting for the dependencies due to the longitudinal nature
of the data. Since the covariance is viewed as secondary, the method does not yield a
variance components analysis, which one might use to address our labor market hypotheses,
for example.

2.2

Individual-specific analysis

Individual-specific effect models consist of two key components: the fixed effects, which capture gross differences between individuals based on differences in their explanatory covariates;
and the random effects, which reflect the influence of unobserved covariates. These so-called
“unobserved” covariates are just a device to capture unexplained but systematic variation
in outcomes. Typically there is no single covariate, such as “motivation,” that would replace
the individual effects in our model, were we able to measure it. Rather, after controlling
for what was measured, some systematic differences between individuals are likely to exist
for a variety of reasons. Because we are looking at longitudinal data, we can verify that
some differences seem to persist throughout an individual’s life course, and that these are
not simply random disturbances.1
1

Note that this modeling philosophy is agnostic toward the substantive interpretation assigned to the
systematic differences.

7

Under model (4), the fixed effects are captured by the Xi β term, while the random
effects are modeled via Zi δi . The δi vector is indexed with an i to reflect the fact that every
individual is expected to have their own value for this “parameter.” These models are also
referred to as random coefficient models (Longford 1993) because the coefficient on the Z i
terms is allowed to vary. These coefficients introduce extra-mean variation into the response
in a systematic manner mediated by the design matrix Zi .
We interpret these models conditional on the individual specific effects, so we are modeling E(Yi |Xi , Zi , δi ), rather than E(Yi |Xi ). Using model (4), the interpretation of the fixed
effects parameters shifts to the following. Given the individual specific effect δi , the expected
response for individual i is Xi β + Zi δi . We are making statements about individuals, not
populations; the regression coefficients reflect this distinction and should be interpreted in
this conditional manner. In the standard linear mixed effects model in which all random
components are assumed Gaussian, the distinction between population average and individual specific modeling is more philosophical, as the models and their parameter estimates are
identical. This is not the case, for a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM, McCulloch
1997, Hu, et al. 1998, Crouchley and Davies 1999).
What may be less immediately apparent about this shift toward an individual-specific
perspective is that the parameters that define the distribution of the effects often represent
meaningful components of variation. For example, if δi is a scalar and Zi is a column of ones,
then the individual differences are being modeled as shifts in the intercept. This implies
that the differences between individuals are constant over the lifecourse. The variance of
the random effect δi is an important model parameter. If it is large, then large differences
between individuals exist and persist throughout the lifecourse; if it is small, they do not.
The ability to interpret a variance component in terms of a substantive question is a key
feature of individual-specific modeling.
Note that not all mixed effects models are oriented toward meaningful variance components analyses. Beyond the fixed effects, the variation is modeled in the random effects and
in the residual variation structure. In model (4), δi ∼ Nq (0, G) and i ∼ Nni (0, R), and the
residual variation structure, R, can be made arbitrarily complex. There is often a tension,
in terms of modeling, between these two components. ARMA models (Box and Jenkins
1976) can capture a substantial portion of the within-individual correlation, but they do so
via parameters that do not take on individual-specific values. For example, the correlation
between observations may be given by ρ, but ρ does not vary between individuals. So we
know how variation occurs, but we cannot directly use it to position a curve above or below
the mean trajectory.
Jones (1990) discusses this model formulation issue by comparing a classical random
8

growth curve model to an AR(1) model for that same structure. He finds that these two
approaches typically compete with each other in terms of explaining the variation in the
data. We tend to favor models that emphasize structured variation in the Zi δi term, because
these provide direct summaries of differences between individuals.
In sum, mixed effects models may be based on an individual-specific philosophy, but they
are not required to do so. Thus, care must be given in the model formulation process as to
which philosophical perspective to adopt.

2.3

Latent Curve Models

A related, but philosophically different approach to modeling longitudinal trajectories was
developed by Meredith and Tisak (1990).2 They outline a framework in which each response
is a weighted average of a fixed set of curves:
Yi (t) =

X

ωik φk (t) + i (t),

(5)

k

where Yi (t) represents the response for the ith individual, ωik is the individual-specific coefficient associated with the k th latent curve φk (t), and i (t) is the residual process. The φk
capture the shape and magnitude of the variation, and the ωik allow individuals to differ
systematically, much in the same way that random coefficients do in mixed effects models.
In the above formulation, the mean process will be a specific weighted sum of the latent
curves, but it could just as well be parameterized separately, as in the fixed effects portion of
a mixed model. For the remainder of this discussion, we will ignore the mean of the process,
or assume it is identically zero.
If the latent curves are known, then the formulation is similar to a mixed effects model.
If we stack the φk as columns of a design matrix Z(t) = {φ1 (t), φ2 (t), . . . , φK (t)} at T design
points t1 , t2 , . . . , tT , then we can estimate a model:
Yi (t) = Z(t)δi + i (t),
again, ignoring the mean process. But when model (5) was originally presented, it was assumed that the latent curves were not known and would be estimated directly from the data.
With a few additional assumptions, this would be a factor analysis, which is a particular
decomposition of the covariance into structured and residual variation. The former are captured in the factor loadings, while the latter are summarized by the specific variances. The
large variability inherent in covariance estimation prompted researchers to impose smoothness constraints on the curves (Rice and Silverman 1991). A basic premise of the new model

We also refer the reader to Raykov (2000), in which latent curve modeling is developed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. SEM emphasizes covariance structure in the model formulation.

9

that we will propose is that smooth latent curves can go a long way toward describing
systematic variation in longitudinal data.
In practice, the latent curve model described above cannot be estimated without further
assumptions. If the φk are known, then this can be estimated as a random growth curve
mixed effects model. If they are left completely unspecified, we have a factor analysis formulation. Both of these model-based approaches avoid some technical problems that arise
when an estimate of the full unspecified covariance matrix is required.3 Moving beyond these
traditional models will actually open up a whole new way to think about longitudinal data
modeling, and we develop this alternative approach at length in Section 3.

2.4

Latent Class Models

So far, we have discussed models for which differences between individuals are expressed
as an offset from the mean value in shifts that come from a continuous distribution. For
example, the random coefficients in mixed effects models come from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, yielding a wide (actually, infinite) variety of outcomes. If the differences
“clump” together in a natural way, then it might make sense to restrict the variation to a
finite set of possibilities, in which each represents a clump or cluster of similar outcomes
in the population. This is the approach taken by latent class analysis (Clogg 1995).4 The
analyst divides the population into K distinct classes, and typically any variation that exists
within a class is of secondary interest.5 The model can be represented as:
Yi (t) = Xi (t)βk + i (t), when Ci = k,

(6)

where the random variable Ci captures the latent class membership, and βk represents the
regression coefficient for class k.6 By allowing the regression coefficients to take on several
3

Missing data at the individual-record level is a key challenge in direct estimation of the covariance
matrix but is surmountable. Many algorithms have been developed to estimate pairwise covariances, σ tt0 =
E((Yt − Y¯t )(Yt0 − Y¯t0 )), from all available observations. Unfortunately, the resulting full covariance matrix
may not be positive semi-definite (Jolliffe 1986). Beale and Little (1975) impose a multivariate normality
assumption and estimate the covariance parameters using the method of maximum likelihood. But it is
uncertain how robust these methods are to violations of the normality assumption. Other methods have
been developed, with similar limitations. For further discussion see Devlin, et al. (1981), Locantore, et al.
(1999) and Arminger and Sobel (1990).
4
Strictly speaking, latent class models capture discrete outcomes, while latent trait models are employed
with continuous responses. We view latent class modeling conceptually as a form of mixture modeling
(Banfield and Raftery 1993, Muthen and Shedden 1999), and thus make no distinction as to response type
for these models.
5
The model-based clustering work of Banfield and Raftery (1993) is an exception; they try to capture the
within-class variation using several different forms for the covariance.
6
Comparing this to a standard mixed effects model, it is interesting to note that one can view the β k as
random coefficients governed by a multinomial distribution, in which case E(βk ) may be different from zero,
and Xi (t) assumes the role of both mean and random effects design matrices (Xi (t) and Zi (t) in (4)). Such

10

different values, a set of distinct trajectories can be captured, assuming that the data support
them. In formulating such models, one typically models membership in one of the K classes
as a random process following a multinomial distribution, so individuals are members of
exactly one class. Several features of the population are documented in this approach: the
shape of the different trajectories, and the probability of membership in each. Extensions of
this approach by Muthen and Shedden (1999) and Roeder, et al. (1999) involve estimating
a multinomial “choice” model for class membership. For example, we might assume that
membership is based on a multinomial logit model in which some subset of the explanatory
covariates play a role:
logit [P (Ci = k|Xi )] = θk + Xi βk , k = 1, . . . , K,
where Xi are explanatory variables influencing membership and θk are scalars (for identifiability, we would fix θ1 = 0 and β1 = 0). The full model combines this choice model with a
model for the response, conditional on the class membership and the explanatory covariates.
This modeling philosophy focuses on identifying subgroups in the data with similar mean
structures. However there are close links to approaches that model the covariance. To see
this consider the model as the number of latent classes increases. If there is only one latent
class, then this approach is equivalent to regression and is not modeling covariance at all.
As the number of classes increases more of the covariation in profiles is attributed to the
classification. If there are a large number of classes then the covariation in the profiles is
largely explained by the classification and the within-class variation will be reduced. There
is a clear tradeoff between mean and covariance modeling as the number of classes increases.
However, the present latent class models do not attempt to identify features shared by the
entire population (the features are by definition disjoint), and we do not consider them here.

2.5

Discussion

In sum, there are several different ways to think about modeling longitudinal data. One can
concentrate on the population average and represent the covariance structure as a foil. Or,
one can model individual differences directly by imposing a strict structure on how these
differences arise. A relatively general framework is to decompose variation into the sum of
curves with different weights. This could be in the form of a factor analysis, but a modelbased approach to this is preferred over analyses based on the directly estimated covariance
matrix. In some instances, one can separate the variation into similar clusters, with an
explicit model for how these are determined by explanatory covariates.
random coefficients follow a discrete, rather than the more classical continuous, distribution. We thank an
anonymous reviewer for suggesting this interpretation.

11

All of these are good ideas, depending on the substantive issues to be addressed. We
would use the second and third to explicitly model variation in populations that is quite
general in form and consider the fourth when natural clusters are apparent.

3

A hybrid model

The theoretical approaches of Section 2 each have their value and place. In our labor economic example, we wish to extract permanent and transient variance components. We want
the permanent component to reflect features of the whole population while still allowing the
expression of individual differences. A modeling class that identifies a common, populationlevel pattern as distinct from short-term effects requires a hybrid modeling philosophy, since
both population-average and individual-specific approaches are being employed. When used
to address hypotheses 1 and 2, such an approach will provide a highly interpretable and
novel variance components decomposition.

3.1

The proto-spline model class

In Scott (1998) and Scott and Handcock (2000), we introduced the hybrid proto-spline class
of heterogeneity models. Motivated by a longitudinal study of wage growth, we formulated
a class of models that capture long- and short-term features of the covariance structure.
The models use a latent curve formulation to identify long-term patterns of variation, and
they yield a meaningful variance components decomposition. The proto-spline class is distinguished by the data-adaptive manner in which the curves are estimated. We will now
describe this class in detail.
The proto-splines class is derived from the model class (5) of Meredith and Tisak (1990),
Yi (t) = µi (t) +

K
X

ωik φk (t) + i (t).

(7)

k=1

We have added a general mean process and changed the approach to modeling ωik as follows.
What was formerly an unconstrained individual specific weight, we will now view as a random
coefficient from some known distribution. In addition, we will specify a functional form for
the φk (t). However, only a functional form and not a specific function is necessary for
estimation of the proto-spline class.
We restrict the φk to be orthonormal.7 This parallels the orthogonality employed in principal components analysis and allows us to interpret each curve’s contribution as mathematically distinct from the others. We assume that the random coefficients, ωik are independent

By orthonormal it is meant that

12

(for different k), which further uncouples the latent curves. This formulation mirrors many
psychological and behavioral models in which a response is the combination of several orthogonal shocks to the system. For the proto-spline class, the way the orthogonality of the
φk is maintained is a departure from techniques used in principal component analysis and
in Rice and Silverman (1991), in that no external constraints are placed on the estimation
procedure.
Consider first the case where the stochastic variation can be described by one curve, φ 1
(this is a single latent curve model). We must specify the functional form of φ1 , and this is
done by choosing an appropriate functional space.8 For example, we can assume that φ1 is a
cubic spline with knots at four equispaced time points. Cubic splines are smooth functions
that have a tremendous degree of flexibility in terms of the possible set of shapes that they
describe (see Green and Silverman 1994 for details). In our theoretical development (Scott
and Handcock 2000), we employed the cubic spline function space because of its smoothness
features and flexibility, and this is where the “spline” portion of the proto-spline class is
derived. We are not restricted to the class of cubic splines; for example, we can specify that
φ1 has the form of a jump process, well-described by wavelets (Ogden 1996). To keep the
discussion on familiar ground, φ1 will come from the function space of all quadratic curves
for most of the remainder of this paper.
We denote the chosen function space by H, and proceed with the specification of the
proto-spline model class. Let ψ1 (t), . . . , ψT (t) be an orthogonal basis for H. Then φ1 ∈ H is
a specific linear combination of those bases, just as is an element of a vector space:
φ1 (t) =

T
X

ηj ψj (t),

(8)

j=1

where the ηj are T non-random parameters that define the curve. If H is smooth, then so is
φ1 (t). Extending this to the response variable, for the full model, we have
Yi (t) = µi (t) + ωi1 φ1 (t) + i (t)
= µi (t) + ωi1

T
X

ηj ψj (t) + i (t),

(10)

j=1

where ωi1 is a mean zero random coefficient with variance one and i (t) are i.i.d. Gaussian
random variables with variance σ2 .9
8

Function spaces have properties similar to vector spaces and are collections of curves that share a set of
well defined properties. We use them to limit the set of possible shapes that define the structured variation
in a process (see Jain et al. 1995 for details of function space theory).
9
Note that the magnitude of the variation associated with φ1 is contained in its norm, and the residual
variation structure i (t) can be made more complex.

13

Our model has two variance components, the variance of ωi1 and the residual variance,
σ2 ,

and it is a parametric covariance model that defers specification of the curve φ1 (t) to the
estimation phase. The uncertainty in the form of φ1 (t) (until estimation) is a distinguishing
feature of proto-spline models. Note that the parameters ηj define the shape of φ1 , which is
fixed. These parameters do not represent the variance of a random coefficient, but taken as
a whole, they determine the magnitude of the random curve φ1 and thus the variance in the
process.
The uncertainty allowed in the proto-spline class deserves further attention. In a standard mixed effects model, the random effects design matrix is fixed. Systematic variation
takes a known form mediated by that design. The proto-spline class is a departure from
this paradigm because it allows the shape of the design, given by φ1 in our example, to
be determined from all of the information in the data. In this sense, the curve φ1 is a
population-average value—the whole population influences its shape, and it can be considered a population “feature.” Individual-specific differences are directly modeled using the
random coefficient ωi1 . So this model is a hybrid between population-average and individualspecific philosophies and it belongs to the latent curve class of models.
In fact, the only philosophy not employed here is that of latent class modeling. As
previously discussed, there is always a tension between modeling the covariance and modeling
the mean, and since our emphasis is on covariance modeling, we do not utilize the latent
class modeling philosophy, in which mean processes dominate.

3.2

Extensions

In this section we extend the development of the single proto-spline model in (7)-(10) to the
general multiple proto-spline model. We note that the choice of our function space implies
that φ1 has a nonparametric interpretation, since it is a curve lying in a potentially smooth,
continuous function space. Note that the model is not restricted to the space of any particular
functions. Any finite-dimensional function space (or vector space) can be employed. An
advantage to the proto-spline class of models is that the bases may be chosen to reflect the
form expected in the substantive process without knowing which specific version of that
form is present. If we choose models that result in latent curve estimates with a functional
interpretation, features such as the derivative become available.
We define the full proto-spline class by extending the single curve example to more than
one curve without introducing additional parameters. The main idea is to use only a subset
of the T bases ψj to construct each curve φk . For this development, we let H be a basis for
cubic splines with an appropriate set of knots. Let Ik be an indexing function defined on

the integers 1, . . . , T , which selects the basis functions used to construct the k th curve. In
14

our simple example, φ1 uses all T basis functions, so I1 = {1, . . . , T }. We construct latent
curves as a deterministically weighted sum of the basis functions specified by the indexing
function I so

φk (t) =

X

ηj ψj (t).

(11)

j∈Ik

In order to insure orthogonality of the φk , the index sets given by Ik must be disjoint. This

restriction implies that once we decide to estimate more than one latent curve, the curves are
highly constrained elements from the class H, using only a subset of the bases for each. Since

in the theoretical development H was chosen to be the natural cubic splines, we named the
resulting φk proto-splines, because they are partial versions of a full spline fit. This method
requires T parameters to build all K curves; if we do not normalize the curves, then for
identifiability the random coefficients ωik are all presumed to have variance one.
To place this model in the context of those previously developed, we examine it for two
extreme cases. First, if K = T , then each proto-spline is just a rescaled version of the basis
function. This is essentially the model proposed in Brumback (1996) and Brumback and
Rice (1998), although the form of their model was chosen to produce cubic spline predictions
for individual curves. If K = 1, then we are estimating a smooth principal component in
the presence of noise, and it is constrained to be a natural cubic spline.10
A more useful approach is to choose K to be small in relation to T , so that for equalsized index sets, T /K bases are available for each latent curve. Equations (7) and (11) still
apply, but the “proto-spline” nature of the curve estimates becomes more apparent. This
intermediate case is similar to a principal functions analysis (Ramsay and Silverman 1997),
in which we expect that most of the variation in the process is captured in a few of the
largest principal functions. We are enforcing a small number of these by our choice of K,
and we maintain the orthogonality requirement by the way the model is constructed. Note
that this model differs from a principal functions analysis in that we can choose our function
spaces with substantive features in mind, rather than simple smoothness constraints. We
then build our model directly around these structures.

3.3

Link to Mixed Effects models

The standard mixed effects model can be expressed in the following form:
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + Zi (t)δi + i (t).

(12)

A key feature of this model is that Xi (t) and Zi (t) are prespecified designs. The single latent
curve proto-spline model is precisely the above model, with Zi (t) = φ1 (t) and δi = ωi1 , only
10

Another name for smooth principal components, principal functions, comes from the functional data
analyses arena and is discussed at length in Ramsay and Silverman (1997).

15

Zi (t) is specified from the data. This illustrates a conceptual distinction between proto-spline
models and other mixed effects models.
To explore the conceptual difference, we will consider three random quadratic models.
For Model I, we assume that we know the exact quadratic curve that describes the structured
covariation about the mean. Let Zi (t) = t+ 12 t2 , so Zi (t) is a scalar-valued function describing
a particular growth structure. Further, let the random effect, δi , be a Gaussian random
variable with unknown variance (the variance is one of the model’s variance components).
For a specific individual,
1
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + (t + t2 )δi + i (t).
2

(13)

Every subject gets some random multiple of the fixed curve t + 21 t2 .
For Model II we consider a mixed effects model in which each individual has their own
quadratic perturbation as follows. Let the elements forming the three columns of Zi (t) be
given by the vector (1, t, t2 ), and let δi = (δ1i , δ2i , δ3i ) be a vector of random coefficients, with
a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Then for an individual specific curve,
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + δ1i + δ2i t + δ3i t2 + i (t).

(14)

While this is quite flexible, the variance components analysis requires a full description of
the estimated covariance structure of the random effects, which is contained in a 3×3 matrix
that includes important covariance as well as variance components. We must use all of this
information when describing any variance partitioning.
Model I is highly inflexible in that we must impose an exact form for growth beyond the
mean. However, the variance component for δi is highly interpretable—it is the variance of
the coefficient of precisely determined shocks to the system, so a larger variance means there
is greater dispersion in individual growth, and that all structured growth follows the same
form. It would be difficult to make a similar statement about Model II.
For Model III we consider a single latent curve proto-spline model, which offers the
interpretability of the simpler model (I), and the flexibility of the more complex model (II).
Let φ1 (t) = η1 ψ1 (t) + η2 ψ2 (t) + η3 ψ3 (t), where ψ1 (t) = 1, ψ2 (t) = t and ψ3 (t) = t2 .11 While
this might resemble model II, the vector (η1 , η2 , η3 ) is common to each individual and does
not represent individual-specific random effects. Every individual curve has the following
form:
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + δi (η1 + η2 t + η3 t2 ) + i (t),

(15)

with the parameters (η1 , η2 , η3 ) fixed and identical across individuals; this is a reparameterization of (10) that keeps the notation consistent. Each of these models is different, and
11

We are ignoring the orthogonality requirement in this example for illustrative purposes.

16

we claim that the proto-splines offer an effective compromise between the rigidity and flexibility of Models I and II, respectively, while remaining highly interpretable from a variance
components perspective.
To understand the link between proto-splines and other mixed effects models it is important to understand their technical distinctions. Scott and Handcock (1999) discuss estimation
for the proto-spline model and show that there is a likelihood-equivalent but non-standard
mixed effects model corresponding to the proto-spline class. In this section we describe the
ways in which the proto-spline model is non-standard.
For notational convenience we suppress reference to time in the functions, representing
ψj (t) and Zi (t) as ψj and Zi , respectively. Let Zi = {ψ1 , ψ2 . . . , ψT } be a design matrix

constructed using the basis functions for the space H. The coefficients ηj are assumed to
be ordered so that if there are K different groups used in the model, with the k th group
given as γk = (ηk1 , . . . , ηknk )T , then the coefficients can be stacked into a T × K matrix Γ =

LK

γk . The difference between these two models can be understood by examining their
representations. Our proto-spline model class is:
k=1

Yi = Xi β + Zi Γδi + i ,

(16)

where δi ∼ NK (0, IK ). The likelihood-equivalent mixed effects model is
Yi = Xi β + Zi δi∗ + i ,

(17)

where δi∗ ∼ NT (0, ΓΓ0 ).
The proto-spline formulation (16) has K random effects, while (17) has T . In (16),
the random effect distribution is completely known (N (0, 1)), while in (17) the parameters
governing the effects (the γk ’s), must be estimated for us to know the structure of the random
effects. In (16), the design Zi Γ represents the latent curve φ1 and is estimated, while in
(17), the design Zi is prespecified. These distinctions are convenient ways to interpret the
components of the models; they have the same likelihood and set of unknown parameters.
In principal, the likelihood equivalence means that any software that can estimate a mixed
effects model can be used to estimate the parameters of the proto-spline class. However,
the covariance structure associated with model (17) would not be implemented in standard
statistical software for mixed effects models, such as SAS PROC MIXED or lme in Splus.
While we have some evidence that these are different models, is this really the case?
Restricting our attention to the single proto-spline model, formulation (16) contains a scalar
random effect, δi , while the vector δi∗ defined in (17) contains T effects. It is interesting to
note that the covariance structure ΓΓ0 governing δi∗ is degenerate, since ΓΓ0 is not positive
definite. This does not introduce problems with estimation, however, because the degeneracy
17

is removed in the full likelihood, once residual variation is included. If one examines the
structure ΓΓ0 more closely, it is apparent that each element of the vector δi∗ is linearly
dependent on each of the others, so in essence only one random effect is generated by
this covariance structure.12 So the likelihood-equivalent model (17) is a non-standard mixed
effects model, which is equivalent to our proto-spline model, even in terms of the observations
that would be generated from it, if we consider the limit of its degenerate covariance matrix.
What this means is that our proto-spline formulation effectively “corrects” the degeneracy
in (17) by modeling the random effects in a simpler manner, without direct reference to the
relationships indicated by the latter model’s ΓΓ0 covariance structure. The γk parameters
contained in the Γ matrix are essential to each formulation of the model, but should not be
confused with what is actually random in the process. By viewing the design as estimated,
rather than prespecified, our formulation (16) correctly separates the model into a portion
driven by population features contained in the γk and individual features represented by δi .
In sum, the proto-spline class provides an interpretation for an interesting class of nonstandard mixed effect models.13 This interpretation is a philosophically distinct, hybrid
modeling approach, and thus not only generates new knowledge with its use, but also establishes a new way to “allocate” the information provided in longitudinal data. The parameters
contained in γk partition the variance as follows: they set the overall level of variation, since
this is given by the sum of the components’ squared values; and they describe the correlation structure because they define a shape which relates observations at different points in
time. This formulation thus captures two things simultaneously in a full modeling class—
orienting a modeling class to have these philosophical properties is to our knowledge novel
in the literature.14 By developing this class using likelihood-based procedures, a complete
set of inferential tools is at the analyst’s disposal. Scott and Handcock (2000) establish the
asymptotic properties of this class and discuss inferential techniques. Being able to differentiate between population and individual effects is crucial to the formation of comparative
statements in the policy domain.
12

Due to the degeneracy, this analysis involves taking the limit as the covariance structure approaches
ΓΓ0 from a “nearby” positive definite structure. The dependent relationships correspond to the relative
magnitudes of the components ηkj of γk .
13
Given their degeneracies, it is unclear if they can truly be labeled as mixed effects models; they are
certainly non-standard.
14
The proto-spline class is closely linked to a factor analysis model, which could be interpreted similarly, but
we have not seen a formulation that explicitly attempts to guide the shape of the factors using something as
flexible as a function space. The work of Rice and Silverman (1991) was pioneering by constraining principal
components to be smooth, but was not presented as a modeling class, and inferential properties were not
fully developed.

Illustration

For ease of exposition, we illustrate our model class by fitting a single latent quadratic curve
proto-spline model to longitudinal wage data from the NLS. For the fixed effects, Xi (t), we
use a simple quadratic in age; this yields Model III of Section 3.3. In Figure 4, we display the
cross-sectional mean of the process.15 It provides the center from which the curves deviate.
In Figure 5, we superimpose 4 simulated realizations from the proto-spline model fit, with
the residual process i (t) suppressed. The fitted curve φˆ1 used in that simulation is presented
in Figure 6. ¿From this figure, one can see that the growth of wages near the college years
of 18 to 22 sets the extent of growth for the later years as well. The shape of the single
latent curve describes the long-term trend in variation—strong growth in the 20s, followed
by steady but diminished growth in the 30s. Each realization is simply the mean curve plus
some random multiple (positive or negative) of the latent curve φˆ1 .

One might be concerned that imposing a quadratic latent curve is overly restrictive and
essentially forces the decomposition into the shape indicated above. However, within the
class of quadratic curves there are pure linear and constant curves, so if there were no
change in the growth rate at early and later ages, then we would expect a different fitted
latent curve. By forming a single latent curve spanning all ages, we are specifying that
we want this curve to represent long-term structure, within the quadratic class. This is in
part how we can model the covariance structure for the entire age span even though only
segments of the full trajectory are observed for a specific individual.16 More complex spaces

As discussed, there is no choice for the mean that does not depend on the choice of covariance structure.
We found the mean to be fairly robust to alternative formulations, and chose a quadratic mean for ease of
exposition.

may reveal more complicated dependencies, should they exist, and they should be considered

In Figure 5, we see that the effect of the single latent curve crosses the mean at age
17. The zero value for φˆ1 near this age corresponds to a negligible amount of permanent
variance, but even this is not predetermined by our choice of basis. If below-mean wages
at those ages were to lead to much larger gains later on, the “crossover” would be at some
later age. Random quadratics do limit us to a single change in the direction of growth
(positive or negative), while higher order polynomials would not. Finally, note an important
difference between this model and Model II. In Model II, each individual has a uniquely
span ages 14-30 and 21-37 in the extremes. No information on the correlation between responses at age
14 and 37 is available at the individual level. Estimating the covariance between ages 14 and 37, without
making further assumptions about the covariance, is not possible. This concern and others noted by Jolliffe
(1986) and Beale and Little (1975) are sufficient to warrant a model-based approach; the gains in precision
associated with the imposition of a model (Altham 1984) further justify this. For a more sophisticated
treatment of missing data issues in covariance structure estimation, the reader is also referred to Arminger
and Sobel (1990).

In our model, which is basically Model III, every individual’s variation beyond the mean has
the same shape, given by φˆ1 —only the magnitude of that variation is allowed to vary.

Application and comparison of models

To illustrate how the models differ in practice, we apply several different covariance models
to labor market data from the NLS. After a preliminary analysis, we found that the mean
structure in this data resembles a quadratic curve, so we set the columns of the fixed effects
design matrix to correspond to constant, linear and quadratic growth over time.17 More
complex mean structures can describe the influence of additional covariates on aggregate
wage growth; our goal in this study is to understand the degree of long-term wage stratification, so the overall divergence of these curves over time in comparable samples yields
important substantive information. Next, we must select a form for the structured portion
of the variation. For wage data, the structured portion consists of long-term, or permanent,
differences between wage trajectories.
We will compare three models. The first is a random quadratic mixed effects model
similar to Model II and to that used by Bernhardt, et al. (1997) in their analyses. The
second is a single latent curve proto-spline model, similar to Model III, and the third is
an extension of proto-spline models that includes a second non-orthogonal latent curve.
Beyond the structural variation just described, the residual variation is modeled simply as
independent with constant variance.

5.1

Random Quadratics

The strength of a random quadratic model, such as that given by (14) is the flexibility
provided by the three random coefficients, δ1i , δ2i and δ3i . Note that the quadratic basis we
use is an orthogonalized and normalized version of (1, t, t2 ), which is also the fixed effects
basis. The random coefficients are globally constrained to come from a multivariate Gaussian
density. This choice yields a broad range of curves of various shapes and intensities. This
distributional form does, however, require that there are no clusters of curves, or other
multimodalities.
We assume that the δi are distributed as N (0, G), where G is a completely unspecified
3 × 3 covariance matrix defined by six distinct parameters. We fit the model on data from
17

Note that we orthogonalize and normalize
√ these basis vectors, so instead of a vector of ones, the first
column is a vector consisting entirely of 1/ 22, based on the 22 ages from 16 to 37.

Figure 7: Permanent wage variance for random quadratic model
at the earliest ages indicates some initial stratification between individual trajectories that
seems to diminish by age 20, only to increase substantially from that point forward, with
a dramatic rise after age 32. Had permanent differences in trajectories been limited to an
intercept shift, this graph would have consisted of a horizontal line some distance above the
axis. The result above indicates that wages fan out quite dramatically as individuals age,
and gives some indication of how the process accelerates. We can infer that the trajectory
fans out as a whole because the partition is based on a model employing a continuous curve
for the permanent portion of the trajectory.
18

All of the following results are based on recent cohort data; we make cross-cohort comparisons in Section

5.4.
19

Differences in these findings and those presented by Bernhardt, et al. (1997) are due to a different choice
for the quadratic basis, but are otherwise comparable.

22

5.2

Single latent curve proto-spline

In this model, we assume that most of the structured variation takes a specific form, but we
let the exact shape be determined by the data. The explicit model is
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + δi φ1 (t) + i (t),

(18)

where φ1 is the single latent curve, assumed to lie in the space of quadratic curves, and δi is
the random coefficient for the ith individual. This is the same model as the one used for our
illustrative example in Section 4. A look at Figure 5 (prior page) reveals the strength of this
model. A wide range of outcomes are easily represented by the mean plus a random multiple
of the single latent curve, φˆ1 . Figure 6 (prior page) displays this curve for the recent cohort.
In this figure, the interpretability of this class of longitudinal data models becomes apparent. The single latent curve reveals most of what we need to know about structured
ˆ which along with design matrix Zi
variation. Contrast this to the covariance matrix G,
provides the equivalent information in a less accessible form. The random coefficient on our
proto-spline model is standard Gaussian, so we have an immediate sense of the range of
impact of the single latent curve.
The restriction to a single latent curve does limit our ability to model more complex
structured variation. In Figure 8 below, we see that the permanent variation, the squared
version of φˆ1 , describes a very simple growth structure.20 Two features stand out in comparison to random quadratic models: the permanent variation starts out lower at the youngest
ages and it does not grow as dramatically as individuals age. We believe that the initial
variation is less important from a likelihood perspective, so it is effectively being ignored in
the estimation process. Had we used a higher order polynomial, we might have discovered
persistent initial wage differences. If this were the case, we would expect φˆ1 to begin higher,
possibly decrease somewhat and then increase again, in a shape similar to the permanent
variance graph from the random quadratic model.

5.3

Double latent curve model

The limitations of a single curve model prompts us to explore a model with two latent curves.
Fitting such a model under the pure proto-spline formulation would require the fitted curves
to be orthogonal, and this restricts the function spaces in which each may lie. We propose a
new model that effectively “reuses” the basis for each latent curve. The model, abstractly,
is given by
Yi (t) = Xi (t)β + δ1i φ1 (t) + δ2i φ2 (t) + i (t),
20

(19)

The permanent variance calculation is straightforward in this case because the random coefficient δ i is
standard Gaussian.

with k = 1 or 2, effectively doubling the number of parameters used by the single latent
curve model. After adding some identifiability constraints to our estimation procedure, we
were able to fit this more complex model.
The double latent curve model can best be understood as the combination of a common
mean process and two independent “shocks” taking some functional form. We choose to
continue to employ the space of quadratic polynomials for ease of exposition. Looking at
Figure 9, we find that the fitted curves are quite different from each other. These are the
forms for the two shocks, φˆ1 and φˆ2 . We see that φˆ1 is quite similar to its counterpart in the
single latent curve model, although it starts out further below the origin. The latter feature
will induce greater permanent variation at the youngest ages, and then this will subside, as
the curve crosses the origin between ages 18 and 19 (contrast this to the crossing at age 17 in
the single curve model). The second curve introduces a whole new feature to the covariation.
It appears that individuals who start out earning more are penalized as they age. This is
indicated by φˆ2 ’s initially positive level of about 0.2 at age 16, which sinks to -0.3 by age 37.
Of course, negative random coefficients are just as likely as positive ones, so this curve could
also represent later growth for young workers who initially accept lower wages. There is mild
evidence that this is capturing an “education effect,” in which individuals who defer fully
entering the labor market (and possibly pursue education or training) benefit with larger
wage growth in the long run.21
21

This effect was based on an analysis of the final level of education attained by each individual and the
predicted value of the coefficient δˆ2i of φˆ2 .

24

Note also the similarities and differences of our fitted model to a principal components
analysis (PCA). The proto-spline restriction to a smooth function space means that shortterm variability is definitely removed, and each curve represents a permanent component of
variation. With a model-based approach, we can precisely describe how the latent curves
are added to the response process. This is less immediate with the components in a PCA,
because the PC scores have no predetermined distributional form. Further, the proto-spline
process is well-defined under the entire age range of interest without either the use of an ad
hoc procedure or requiring a balanced design.

Figure 10: Permanent wage variance for double latent curve model
including two curves additively and independently, this model allows for larger early and
later year variation. The effects are permanent, in that they persist over the lifetime of a
worker, but their independence points to a subtlety of these variance decompositions. Two
curves, along with their coefficients describe the systematic portion of a trajectory, but the
independence of the coefficients severs any link between the two. In terms of generating
25

mechanisms, this only makes sense if two different features of the wage growth process are
being captured, such as an overall growth (often attributed to returns to job tenure and
experience) and an education effect.
The above comment also points to a limitation of the random quadratic model. Namely,
it is hard to describe an underlying process (often thought of as a latent characteristic) that
is driving the three coefficients forming the curves. It is hard to imagine that a social or
economic generating mechanism involves intercept, slope and acceleration components. The
latent curve models provide simpler explanations, which is an advantage in this case.

5.4

Comparing variance partitions

While related, these three models provide different variance decompositions. We display the
permanent variation plots in Figure 11, below, and include 95% confidence intervals at each
age. We discuss the construction of those intervals in Section A.1 of the appendix. Notable
differences exist for the youngest and oldest ages, with strong agreement in the middle
range. The single latent curve model does not pick up much structured wage variation at
the youngest ages. If initial differences in wages persist during the youngest ages, but then
diminish, then this model will have to choose between the initial and later year effects, and
since the latter are larger, they tend to dominate. The double proto-spline model picks up
this extra variation in φˆ2 , and this is reflected in larger permanent variance for the younger
ages. The random quadratic model picks up more variation in both younger and older ages
and labels it permanent. We contend that the additional flexibility of the random quadratic
model allows it to follow the raw data more closely, capturing less rigid forms of variation.
This is indirectly confirmed by examining the residual variation, which is 0.072 for random
quadratics, and 0.078 and 0.098 for double and single latent curve models, respectively.

Figure 11: Permanent wage variance for all three models
Below we present the variance decomposition for each cohort to address an important
26

question. While each model partitions the variance differently, do these differences have
substantive impact? That is, how sensitive are the answers to the substantive questions
to the choice of model? In our application, the question of interest is whether or not the
permanent wage variance between the cohorts differs, and if so, by how much. Any model
we use will only be an approximation, but if the answer to our question is consistent across
models, we can have more confidence in any conclusions we draw.
In Figures 12 through 14 below, we make a cross-cohort comparison and display the
model-based permanent variance for each model along with 95% confidence intervals at
each age. All of the models indicate a significantly larger permanent variance in the recent
cohort, starting sometime in the mid-twenties. The difference is most dramatic in the random
quadratic model and least so in the single latent curve model. There is some between-model
discrepancy in what portion of the variance is permanent at the youngest ages, and in
how the cohorts differ. Both latent curve models contain a crossover, in which the original
cohort starts out more stratified until the early twenties, at which point the opposite it true.
In contrast, the random quadratic model posits that both cohorts are more permanently
stratified initially and to a comparable extent. If we are interested in the absolute magnitude
of permanent wage stratification, we must look more closely at all of these models and
determine which is more justified on substantive grounds. If we were concerned about wage
stratification at the younger ages, a deeper understanding of each model’s characteristics is
warranted, since these models tell three different stories.

Discussion of findings

All three of these models indicate a significant increase in permanent wage variation in
the recent cohort for the older ages. But the magnitude of these differences varies greatly
between models, and strong differences in the partitions exist at the younger ages.

Figure 14: Permanent wage variance for double latent curve model
Since the random quadratic model labeled more variation as permanent, it may be overfitting that feature, in some sense. The flexibility of random quadratics admits even a U-shaped
curve, but is it desirable to use such a shape to describe permanent wage gains? U-shaped
curves, in which initial and final wages are nearly identical, involve a shift in the direction of
wage change, from loss to gain, so in what sense is this indicative of a permanent, or lasting,
trend? We must understand how the choice of model is reflected in the variance partition if
we intend to make an informed assessment of social phenomena.
Latent curve models stand out as a philosophically mixed approach to creating variance
partitions. They are highly interpretable, with independent components acting as shocks to
the process. The shocks may be readily interpretable in the context of the generating mechanisms for the social processes under study. They offer a handy form of rigidity compared
to random quadratic models, yet are inherently adaptive to overall patterns of structured
variation. The hybrid nature of this model class provides a new type of analysis to which
results from other classes can be compared. Thus, these models can be viewed as excellent
foils to the classical random quadratic model.
28

All three of the models describe the structured portion of variance in such a way that
“permanent” is a reasonable label to apply. That is, the model describes smooth versions of
the curves in space that are reasonable attempts to separate the analyst-defined signal from
noise; and the signal is non-stochastic, conditional on the parameters that describe it. The
differences in these definitions allow different aspects of variation to be identified.

6

Conclusion

We embarked on this analysis to determine how different models for covariance affect variance
component partitioning. Along the way, we introduced a new, hybrid class of latent curve
models, proto-splines, that offer an interpretable paradigm for describing covariation, which
is well-suited to formulating substantive questions directly. These models locate populationlevel persistent covariance structure and reflect it in the shape and size of latent curves.
We view proto-splines as covariance function smoothers; they are non-parametric in the
sense that the estimated curve lies in a function space, yet the model formulation provides
a straightforward interpretation of the curves that is often missing in other non-parametric
techniques. In the model formulation, the researcher imposes a class of functions to capture
substantively meaningful structure. The restriction to a particular class of functions forces
proto-spline models to be conservative in the way they fit the data—they are less susceptible
to outliers, which in other models may influence both prediction and fit. This makes them
invaluable in comparisons with more traditional models; the ways in which they differ point
out characteristics of each, with the clearly defined behavior of our models acting as a foil
for the others.
In future work, we will consider relaxing the independence assumption for the protospline model class. For example, our double latent curve model could include a term for the
correlation between curves. This extension would open up the possibility of very different
latent curves, since the independence constraint ultimately lowers the likelihood of certain
shapes for the fitted curves. Including more complex residual structures, such as age-specific
variances, as a check on the homogeneous variance assumption could prove useful.
In many socio-economic processes, there are jump points that are not smooth, but have
important substantive meaning. Adapting the proto-spline class to allows for uncertainty
in the timing of the change-point could prove useful. Raftery (1994) explores this issue;
integrating his approaches with ours is a research direction of interest.
Relaxing the Gaussianality assumption is worth investigating, but we would limit this
to forms that remain interpretable, such as parametric forms. One approach that has been
suggested by several researchers is a latent class, or mixture formulation (see Clogg 1995,

29

Banfield and Raftery 1993, Muth´en and Shedden 1999, Roeder 1999, Verbeke and Lesaffre
1997, Xu, et al. 1996). Under this paradigm described earlier, individuals belong to one
latent class, and then conditional on class membership they follow a certain structure. An
important point is that the remaining structure could be flexibly captured in the proto-spline
models just introduced; most models currently in use do not offer such directly interpretable
covariance formulations.
In work in progress, we are examining diagnostics for these models in greater detail.
Model selection criteria such as AIC (Akaike 1974) and BIC (Schwarz 1978) can be applied
here. These are discussed in Vonesh and Chinchilli (1998) and Pinheiro et al. (1994). Recent extensions to the AIC discussed in Simonoff and Tsai (1999) appear to be especially
promising in in the context of these variance component models. An alternative to model
selection is the use of Bayesian model averaging (Hoeting, et al. 1998). A developed set of diagnostic techniques will add to our understanding of how each model captures and partitions
variation.

Appendix
Construction of confidence intervals

Confidence intervals for the model-based variances, such as the permanent variation, are
constructed from the asymptotic covariance matrix of the model parameters. For protospline models, explicit forms for these covariance matrices are given in Scott and Handcock
(2000). The construction begins by finding the variance associated with each point on
the latent curve. Each curve is a linear combination of a set of basis functions, with the
coefficients specified by the model parameters. If these coefficients are given by column vector
`k = (ηk1 , . . . , ηkT )T , the basis functions by matrix Z = [ψ1 , . . . , ψT ] and the asymptotic
covariance matrix of `k by Hk , then the resulting latent curve is given by φk = Z`k and the
covariance of Z`k is ZHk Z T . So the variance of the estimate of the curve φˆk at each time
point (and their covariances) are contained in the diagonals (and off-diagonal elements) of
ZHk Z T . Confidence intervals for the permanent variance (the squared value of the curve
estimate) at a particular time point can be constructed via a delta-method approximation
involving that same asymptotic covariance matrix.22
22

Confidence intervals for extra-mean variation for random quadratic models involve a slightly different
calculation and will not be discussed in this paper.
