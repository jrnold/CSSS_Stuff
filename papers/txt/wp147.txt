Abstract
In areas without complete-coverage civil registration and vital statistics systems
there is uncertainty about even the most basic demographic indicators. In such areas
the majority of deaths occur outside hospitals and are not recorded. Worldwide, fewer
than one-third of deaths are assigned a cause, with the least information available
from the most impoverished nations. In populations like this, verbal autopsy (VA) is
a commonly used tool to assess cause of death and estimate cause-specific mortality
rates and the distribution of deaths by cause. VA uses an interview with caregivers of
the decedent to elicit data describing the signs and symptoms leading up to the death.
This paper develops a new statistical tool known as InSilicoVA to classify cause of
death using information acquired through VA. InSilicoVA shares uncertainty between
cause of death assignments for specific individuals and the distribution of deaths by
cause across the population. Using side-by-side comparisons with both observed and
simulated data, we demonstrate that InSilicoVA has distinct advantages compared to
currently available methods.

Introduction

Data describing cause of death are critical to formulate, implement and evaluate public
health policy. Fewer than one-third of deaths worldwide are assigned a cause, with the
most impoverished nations having the least information (Horton, 2007). In 2007 The Lancet
published a special issue titled “Who Counts?” (AbouZahr et al., 2007; Boerma and Stansfi,
2007; Hill et al., 2007; Horton, 2007; Mahapatra et al., 2007; Setel et al., 2007); the authors
identify the “scandal of invisibility” resulting from the lack of accurate, timely, full-coverage
civil registration and vital statistics systems in much of the developing world. They argue
for a transformation in how civil registration is conducted in those parts of the world so
that we are able to monitor health and design and evaluate effective interventions in a
timely way. Horton (2007) argues that the past four decades have seen “little progress” and
“limited attention to vital registration” by national and international organizations. With
bleak prospects for widespread civil registration in the coming decades, AbouZahr et al.
(2007) recommends “censuses and survey-based approaches will have to be used to obtain
the population representative data.” This paper develops a statistical method for analyzing
data based on one such survey. The proposed method infers a likely cause of death for

2

a given individual, while simultaneously estimating a population distribution of deaths by
cause. Individual deaths by cause can be related to surviving family members, while the
population distribution of deaths provides critical information about the leading risks to
population health. Critically, the proposed method also provides a statistical framework for
quantifying uncertainty in such data.

1.1

Verbal autopsy

We propose a method for using survey-based data to infer an individual’s cause of death
and a distribution of deaths by cause for the population. The data are derived from verbal
autopsy (VA) interviews. VA is conducted by administering a standardized questionnaire
to caregivers, family members and/or others knowledgeable of the circumstances of a recent
death. The resulting data describe the decedent’s health history leading up to death with a
mixture of binary, numeric, categorical and narrative data. These data describe the sequence
and duration of important signs and symptoms leading up to the death. The goal is to infer
the likely causes of death from these data (Byass et al., 2012a). VA has been widely used by
researchers in Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites, such as members
of the INDEPTH Network (Sankoh and Byass, 2012) and the ALPHA Network (Maher et
al., 2010), and has recently received renewed attention from the World Health Organization
(WHO) through the release of an update to the widely-used WHO standard VA questionnaire (World Health Organization, 2012). The main statistical challenge with VA data is
to ascertain patterns in responses that correspond to a pre-defined set of causes of death.
Typically the nature of such patterns is not known a priori and measurements are subject
to multiple types of measurement error, discussed below.
Multiple methods have been proposed to automate the assignment of cause of death from
VA data. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has proposed a number
(for example: Flaxman et al., 2011; James et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2011) some of which
build on earlier work by King and Lu (King et al., 2010; King and Lu, 2008). Altogether,
3

this work has explored a variety of underlying statistical frameworks, although all are similar
in their reliance on a so-called “gold standard” – a database consisting of a large number
of deaths for which the cause has been certified by medical professionals and is considered
reliable. Assuming the gold standard deaths are accurately labeled, methods in this class use
information about the relationship between causes and symptoms from the gold standard
deaths to infer causes for new deaths.
Gold standard databases of this type are difficult and very expensive to create, and
consequently most health researchers and policy makers do not have access to a good cause
of death gold standard. Further it is often difficult to justify devoting medical professionals’
time to performing autopsies and chart reviews for deceased patients in situations with
limited resources. Given these constraints, deaths included in a gold standard database are
typically in-hospital deaths. In most of the areas where VA is needed, many or most deaths
occur in the home and are not comparable to in-hospital deaths. Further, the prevalence of
disease changes dramatically through time and by region. In order to accurately reflect the
relationship between VA data and causes of death, the gold standard would need to contain
deaths from all regions through time; something that no existing gold standard does.
Recognizing the near impossibility of obtaining consistent gold standard databases that
cover both time and space, we focus on developing a method to infer cause of death using
VA data that does not require a gold standard. A method developed by Peter Byass known
as InterVA (Byass et al., 2012a) has been used extensively, including by both the ALPHA
and INDEPTH networks of HDSS sites, and is supported by the WHO. Rather than using
gold standard deaths to inform the relationship between signs and symptoms and causes of
death, InterVA uses information obtained from physicians in the form of ranked lists of signs
and symptoms associated with each cause of death.
In this paper, we present a statistical method for assigning individual causes of death and
population cause of death distributions using VA surveys in contexts where gold standard
data are not available. In the remainder of this section we describe the current practice and

4

three critical limitations. In Section 2 we propose a statistical model that addresses these
three challenges and provides a flexible probabilistic framework that can incorporate the
multiple types of data that are available in practice. Section 3 presents simulation results
comparing our method with InterVA under a variety of conditions. Section 4 presents results
from our method using data from two HDSS sites. Section 5 describes how we incorporate
physician assignment of cause of death. Although these data integrate naturally into our
method, we present them in a separate section because they are only relevant when physiciancoded causes are available. We end with Section 6 which provides a discussion of remaining
limitations of VA data and proposes new directions for inquiry.

1.2

InterVA and three issues

Given that InterVA is supported by the WHO and uses only information that is readily
available in a broad range of circumstances, we consider InterVA to be the most promising
currently available VA method. InterVA (Byass et al., 2012b) distributes a death across a
pre-defined set of causes using information describing the relationship between VA data (signs
and symptoms) and causes provided by physicians in a structured format. The complete
details of the InterVA algorithm are not fully discussed in published work, but they can be
accurately recovered by examining the source code for the InterVA algorithm (Byass, 2012).
Consider data consisting of n individuals with observed set Si of (binary) indicators of
symptoms, Si = {si1 , si2 , ..., siS } and an indicator yi that denotes which one of C causes was
responsible for person i’s death. Many deaths result from a complex combination of causes
that is difficult to infer even under ideal circumstances. We consider this simplification,
however, for the sake of producing demographic estimates of the fraction of deaths by cause,
rather than for generating assignments that reflect the complexity of clinical presentations.
The goal is to infer p(yi = c|Si ) for each individual i and πc , the overall population cause

5

specific mortality fraction (CSMF) for cause c, for all causes. Using Bayes’ rule,

p(yi = c|Si ) =

p(Si |yi = c)p(yi = c)
.
p(Si |yi = c)p(yi = c) + p(Si |yi 6= c)p(yi =
6 c)

(1)

InterVA obtains the numerator in (1) using information from interviews with a group of
expert physicians. For each cause of death, a group of physicians with expertise in a specific
local context provide a “tendency” of observing each sign/symptom, presented in Table 1.
These tendencies are provided in a form similar to the familiar letter grade system used
to indicate academic performance. These “letter grades,” the leftmost column in Table 1,
effectively rank signs/symptoms by the tendency of observing them in conjunction with a
given cause of death. These rankings are translated into probabilities to form a cause by
symptom matrix, Ps|c . InterVA uses the translation given in Table 1. This transformation
in Table 1 is arbitrary and, as we demonstrate in our simulation results in Section 3.2,
influential. Our proposed method uses only the ranking and infers probabilities as part
of a hierarchical model. The probability p(Si |yi = c) in (1) is the joint probability of an

individual experiencing a set of symptoms (e.g. experiencing a fever and vomiting, but not
wasting). It is impractical to ask physicians about each combination of the hundreds of
symptoms a person may experience. Apart from being impossibly time-consuming, many
combinations are indistinguishable because most symptoms are irrelevant for any particular
cause. InterVA addresses this by approximating the joint distribution of symptoms with the
Q
product of the marginal distribution for each symptom. That is, p(Si |yi = c) ≈ Ss=j {p(sij =
1|yi = c)}sij {1 − p(sij = 1|yi = c)}1−sij . This simplification is equivalent to assuming that
the symptoms are conditionally independent given a cause, an assumption we believe is
likely reasonable for many symptoms but discards valuable information in particular cases.
We discuss this assumption further in subsequent sections in the context of obtaining more
information from physicians in the future. This challenge is not unique to our setting and also
arises when using a gold standard dataset for a large set of symptoms. Most of the methods
described above that use gold standard data utilize a similar simplification, but they derive
the necessary p(Si |yi = c) empirically using the gold standard deaths (e.g. counting the
fraction of deaths from cause c that contain a given symptom).
Three issues arise in the current implementation of InterVA. First, although the motivation for InterVA arises through Bayes’ rule, the implementation of the algorithm does not
compute probabilities that are comparable across individuals. InterVA defines p(Si |yi = c)
Q
using only symptoms present for a given individual, that is p(Si |yi = c) , {j:sij =1} p(sij =
1|yi = c). The propensity used by InterVA to assign causes is based only on the presence of
signs/symptoms, disregarding them entirely when they are absent:
p(yi = c)
p(yi = c|Si ∈ {j : sij = 1}) = P Q
C
c=1

{j:sij =1}

p(sij = 1|yi = c)

{j:sij =1} p(sij |yi = c)p(yi = c)

.

(2)

The expression in (2) ignores a substantial portion of the data, much of which could be
beneficial in assigning a cause of death. Knowing that a person had a recent negative HIV
test could help differentiate between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, for example. Using (2)

7

also means that the definition of the propensity used to classify the death depends on the
number of positive responses. If an individual reports a symptom, then InterVA computes
the propensity of dying from a given cause conditional on that symptom. In contrast,
if the respondent does not report a symptom, InterVA marginalizes over that symptom.
Consider as an example the case where there are two symptoms si1 and si2 . If a respondent
reports the decedent experienced both, then InterVA assigns the propensity of cause c as
p(yi = c|si1 = 1, si2 = 1). If the respondent only reports symptom 1, the propensity is
p(yi = c ∩ si2 = 1|si1 = 1) + p(yi = c ∩ si2 = 0|si1 = 1). These two measures represent
fundamentally different quantities, so it is not possible to compare the propensity of a given
cause across individuals.
Second, because the output of InterVA has a different meaning for each individual, it is
impossible to construct valid measures of uncertainty for InterVA. We expect that even under
the best circumstances there is variation in individuals’ presentation of symptoms for a given
cause. In the context of VAs this variation is compounded by the added variability that arises
from individuals’ ability to recollect and correctly identify signs/symptoms. Linguistic and
ethnographic work to standardize the VA interview process could control and help quantify
these biases, though it is not possible to eliminate them completely. Without a probabilistic
framework, we cannot adjust the model for these sources of variation or provide results
with appropriate uncertainty intervals. This issue arises in constructing both individual
cause assignments and population CSMFs. The current procedure for computing CSMFs
aggregates individual cause assignments to form CSMFs (Byass et al., 2012a). This procedure
does not account for variability in the reliability of the individual cause assignments, meaning
that the same amount of information goes into the CSMF whether the individual cause
assignment is very certain or little more than random guessing.
Third, the InterVA algorithm does not incorporate other potentially informative sources
of information. VAs are carried out in a wide range of contexts with varying resources
and availability of additional data. For example, while true “gold standard” data are rarely

8

available, many organizations already invest substantial resources in having physicians review
at least a fraction of VAs and assign a cause based on their clinical expertise. Physicians
reviewing VAs are able to assess the importance of multiple co-occurring causes in ways that
are not possible with current algorithmic approaches, and because of that, physician-assigned
causes are a potentially valuable source of information.
In this paper, we develop a new method for estimating population CSMFs and individual
cause assignments, InSilicoVA, that addresses the three issues described above. Critically,
the method is modular. At the core of the method is a general probabilistic framework. On
top of this flexible framework we can incorporate multiple types of information, depending
on what is available in a particular context. In the case of physician coded VAs, for example,
we propose a method that incorporates physician expertise while also adjusting for biases
that arise from their different clinical experiences.

InSilicoVA

This section presents a hierarchical model for cause-of-death assignment, known as InSilicoVA. This model addresses the three issues that currently limit the effectiveness of InterVA
and provides a flexible base that incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty. Section 2.1
presents our modeling framework. We then present the sampling algorithm in Section 2.2.

2.1

Modeling framework

This section presents the InSilicoVA model, a hierarchical Bayesian framework for inferring
individual cause of death and population cause distributions. A key feature of the InSilicoVA framework is sharing information between inferred individual causes and population
cause distributions. As in the previous section, let yi = {1, ..., C} be the cause of death
indicator for a given individual i and the vector Si = {si1 , si2 , ..., siS } be signs/symptoms.
We begin by considering the case where we have only VA survey data and will address the

9

case with physician coding subsequently. We typically have two pieces of information: (i)
an individual’s signs/symptoms, sij and (ii) a matrix of conditional probabilities, Ps|c . The
Ps|c matrix describes a ranking of signs/symptoms given a particular cause.
We begin by assuming that individuals report symptoms as independent draws from a
Bernoulli distribution given a particular cause of death c. That is,

sij |yi = c ∼ Bernoulli(P (sij |yi = c))

where P (sij |yi = c) are the elements of Ps|c corresponding to the given cause. The assumption that symptoms are independent is likely violated, in some cases even conditional on the
cause of death. Existing techniques for eliciting the Ps|c matrix do not provide information
about the association between two (or more) signs/symptoms occurring together for each
cause, however, making it impossible to estimate these associations. Since yi is not observed
for any individual, we treat it as a random variable. Specifically,

yi |π1 , ..., πC ∼ Multinomial(π1 , ..., πC )

where π1 , ..., πC are the population cause-specific mortality fractions.
Without gold standard data, we rely on the Ps|c matrix to understand the likelihood of
a symptom profile given a particular cause. In practice physicians provide only a ranking of
likely signs/symptoms given a particular cause. Rather than arbitrarily assigning probabilities to each sign/symptom in a particular ordering, as in Table 1, we learn those probabilities.
We could model each element of Ps|c using this expert information to ensure that, within
each cause, symptoms with higher labels in Table 1 have higher probability. Since many
symptoms are uncommon, this strategy would require estimating multiple probabilities with
very weak (or no signal) in the data. Instead we estimate a probability for every letter grade
in Table 1. This strategy requires estimating substantially fewer parameters and imposes
a uniform scale across conditions. Entries in the Ps|c matrix are not individual specific;
10

therefore, we drop the i indicator and refer to a particular symptom sj and entries in Ps|c
as p(sj |y = c). Following Taylor et al. (2007), we give each entry in Ps|c a truncated Beta
prior:
psj |c ∼ 1s|c Beta(αs|c , M − αs|c )
where M and αs|c are prior hyperparameters and are chosen so that αs|c /M gives the desired
prior mean for psj |c . The 1s|c term represents an indicator function that defines an order
over symptoms based on the expert opinion provided by physicians in Table 1. That is, 1s|c
defines psj |c as the portion of a beta distribution between the symptoms with the next largest
and next smallest probabilities according to the values in Table 1. This strategy uses only
the ranking (encoded through the letters in the table) and does not make use of arbitrarily
assigned numeric values, as in InterVA. Our strategy imposes a strict ordering over the
entries of Ps|c . We could instead use a stochastic ordering by eliminating 1s|c in the above
expression. Defining the size of αs|c in an order consistent with the expert opinion in Table 1
would encourage, but not require, the elements of Ps|c to be consistent with expert rankings.
We find this approach appealing conceptually, but not compatible with the current strategy
for eliciting expert opinion. In particular, there are likely entries in Ps|c that are difficult
for experts to distinguish. In these cases it would be appealing to allow the method to infer
which of these close probabilities is actually larger. Current strategies for obtaining Ps|c
from experts, however, do not offer experts the opportunity to report uncertainty, making it
difficult to appropriately assign uncertainty in the prior distribution.
We turn now to the prior distribution over population CSMF’s, π1 , ..., πC . Placing a
Dirichlet prior on the vector of population CSMF probabilities would be computationally
efficient because of Dirichlet-Multinomial conjugacy. However in our experience it is difficult to explain to practitioners and public health officials the intuition behind the Dirichlet hyperparameter. Moreover, in many cases we can obtain a reasonably informed prior
about the CSMF distribution from local public health officials. Thus, we opt for an overparameterized normal prior (Gelman et al., 1996) on the population CSMFs. This prior
11

representation does not enjoy the same benefits of conjugacy but is more interpretable and
facilitates including prior knowledge about the relative sizes of CSMFs. Specifically we model
P
πc = exp θc / c exp θc where each θc has an independent Gaussian distribution with mean
µ and variance σ 2 . We put diffuse uniform priors on µ and σ 2 . To see how this facilitates
interpretability, consider a case where more external data exists for communicable compared
to non-communicable diseases. Then, the prior variance can be separated for communicable
and non-communicable diseases to represent the different amounts of prior information. The
model formulation described above yields the following posterior:

Pr(~y , Ps|c , ~π , µ, σ, α|S1 , ..., Sn ) ∝

To contextualize our work, we can relate it to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and
other text mining approaches to finding relationships between binary features. To compare
InSilicoVA to LDA, consider CSMFs as topics, conditions as words, and cases as documents.
InSilicoVA and LDA are similar in that we may consider each death as resulting from a combination of causes, just as LDA considers each document to be made up of a combination
of topics. Further, each cause in InSilicoVA is associated with a particular set of observed
conditions, while in LDA each topic is associated with certain words. The methods differ,
however, in their treatment of topics (causes) and use of external information in assigning
words (conditions) with documents (deaths). Unlike LDA where topics are learned from
patterns in the data, InSilicoVA is explicitly interested in inferring the distribution of a
pre-defined set of causes of death. InsilicoVA also relies on external information, namely

12

the matrix of conditional probabilities Ps|c to associate symptoms with a given cause. Statistically, this amounts to estimating a distribution of causes across all deaths, then using
the matrix of conditional probabilities to infer the likely cause for each death, given a set of
symptoms. This means that each death arises as a mixture over causes, but inference about
this distribution depends on both the pattern of observed signs/symptoms and the matrix
of conditional probabilities. In LDA, each document has a distribution over topics that is
learned only from patterns of co-appearance between words. We also note that the prior
structure differs significantly from LDA to accomplish the distinct goals of VA.

2.2

Sampling from the posterior

This section provides the details of our sampling algorithm. We evaluated this algorithm
through a series of simulation and parameter recovery experiments. Additional details regarding this process are in the Online Supplement. All codes are written in R (R Core Team,
2014) and will be made available as a package prior to publication.

2.2.1

Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm

The posterior in the previous section is not available in closed form. We obtain posterior
samples using Markov-chain Monte Carlo, specifically the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm
described below. We first give an overview of the entire procedure and then explain the
truncated beta updating step in detail. Given suitable initialization values, the sampling
algorithm proceeds:
1. Sample Ps|c from truncated beta step described in the following section.

We find computation time to be reasonable even for datasets with ∼ 105 deaths. We provide
additional details about assessing convergence in the results section and Online Supplement.

2.2.2

Truncated beta step

As described in the previous section, our goal is to estimate probabilities in Ps|c for each
ranking given by experts (the letters in Table 1). We denote the levels of Pr(s|c) as L(s|c)
and, assuming the prior from the previous section, sample the full conditional probabilities
under the assumption that all entries with the same level in P(s|c) still share the same value.

14

Denoting the probability for a given ranking or tier as P t (si |cj ), the full constraints become:
P t (si |cj ) = P t (sk |cj 0 ), ∀k s.t. L(si |cj ) = L(sj |cj 0 )
P t (si |cj ) < P t (sk |cj 0 ), ∀k s.t. L(si |cj ) < L(sj |cj 0 )
P t (si |cj ) > P t−1 (sk |cj 0 ), ∀k s.t. L(si |cj ) > L(sk |cj 0 ).

The full conditionals are then truncated beta distributions with these constraints, defined
as:

Pr(sj |ck , S, ~y ) = PL(sj |ck )|S,~y ∼

j 0 ,k0 :
L(sj 0 |ck0 )=L(sj |ck )

j 0 ,k0 :
L(sj 0 |ck0 )=L(sj |ck )

where M and αLsj |ck are hyperparameters and ~y is the vector of causes at a given iteration.
We incorporate these full conditionals into the sampling framework above, updating the
truncation at each iteration according to the current values of the relevant parameters.

Simulation studies

To evaluate the potential of InSilicoVA and to compare it to InterVA, we fit both InSilicoVA
and InterVA to simulated data and compare the results in terms of accuracy of individual
cause assignment. We performed two simulation studies using data generated with various
conditional probability matrices Ps|c designed to explore different aspects of the performance
of the two models, and within each study we compared three levels of additional variation
to reflect conditions commonly found in practice.
In each case we simulated 100 datasets, each with 1, 000 deaths. For each dataset we first
simulated a set of deaths with a pre-specified cause distribution. Since cause distributions
vary substantially between areas, we used the reported population cause distribution from
15

multiple HDSS sites in the ALPHA network (Maher et al., 2010), mentioned in the introduction. For each simulation run, we randomly picked the Agincourt study, uMkhanyakude
cohort, or Karonga Prevention Study/Kisesa open cohort HDSS site, then used the cause
distribution from that site as the “true” cause distribution in that simulation run. Karonga
and Kisesa actually represent two HDSS sites, though we combined their results for our
simulation purposes because both have relatively small sample sizes.
In the simulation studies that follow we explore various aspects of the performance of
InSilicoVA and InterVA. Recall that we wish to assign causes of death and estimate a population cause distribution using data from the VA interviews and the physician-reported
cause – sign/symptom association matrix Ps|c . We focus specifically on the first two limitations we identified with InterVA: lack of a probabilistic framework and inability to quantify
uncertainty. In Section 3.1 we evaluate minor/no perturbation to Ps|c under more realistic
scenarios in which data from VA interviews are missing or imperfect. Then in Section 3.2 we
examine the performance of both models when altering the range of possible probabilities in
Ps|c . These simulations demonstrate that the choice of values of Ps|c impacts the resulting
cause assignments and population cause distribution, providing evidence and support for our
probabilistic approach that appropriately captures this uncertainty.

3.1

Simulation 1: InterVA Ps|c

The first set of three simulation studies maintains the basic structure of the table of conditional probabilities Ps|c that describes the associations between signs/symptoms and causes.
Three variations explore the ideal situation, the effect of changing the precise values in Ps|c
and what happens when the data are not perfect.

3.1.1

Baseline

First we test and compare InSilicoVA and InterVA under “best case” conditions in which both
use perfect information. To accomplish this we use the association between signs/symptoms
16

and causes described in Table 1. In each simulation run we sample a new conditional
probability matrix Ps|c with exactly the same distribution of levels as displayed in Table 1.
In this setup both InSilicoVA and InterVA are given the sampled Ps|c so that they have
the true conditional probability matrix used to simulate symptoms, i.e. they have all the
information necessary to recover the “real” individual cause assignments. For InsilicoVA
this means that the prior mean of the conditional probability matrix is correct, and InterVA
has correct conditional probabilities. We run both algorithms on the simulated data. For
InSilicoVA the cause assigned to each death is the one with the highest posterior mean, and
for InterVA the assigned cause is the one with the highest final propensity score. Accuracy
is the fraction of simulated deaths with assigned causes matching the simulated cause.
The left panel of Figure 1 displays accuracy of both methods. We also computed accuracy
for the top three causes for each method and found only very minor differences in the results.
Under these ideal conditions InsilicoVA performs nearly perfectly all the time, and InterVA
also performs well, although there is more variance in the performance of InterVA.

Resampled Ps|c

Next we test the effect of mis-specifying the exact numeric values of Ps|c , a situation that
is always true in reality. It is not realistic to expect physicians to produce numerically accurate conditional probabilities associating causes with signs/symptoms, and for this reason
we want to understand the extent to which each method is affected by mis-specification
of the conditional probability values in Table 1. Recall that the Ps|c supplied with InterVA (described in Table 1 and used throughout this paper) contains the ranked lists of
signs/symptoms provided by physicians and arbitrary values attached to each level.
We performed a simulation designed to evaluate the sensitivity of the algorithms to the
values assigned to the conditional probabilities in Ps|c . The probabilities assigned by InterVA
increase approximately linearly on a log scale. We preserve this relationship but assign new
values to each probability in Ps|c by drawing new values uniformly between log(10−6 ) and
log(0.9999) and then exponentiating and ordering the results. We fit both methods with the
new Ps|c on the simulated data described above.
The middle panel of Figure 1 displays the accuracy of both methods using the misspecified
Ps|c on the ideal simulated data. InSilicoVA’s performance is unchanged indicating that
InSilicoVA is able to adjust the probabilities correctly using the data and is therefore more
robust to misspecification of the conditional probability table. InterVA performs slightly
worse with a reduction in median accuracy and an increase in accuracy variance.

3.1.3

Reporting Error

Finally we investigate the effects of reporting error. Given the nature of VA questionnaires
we expect multiple sources of error in the data. To explore the impact of reporting error
like this, we conduct a third simulation that includes reporting error. We first generate
data as described above for the best case baseline simulation; then we randomly choose a
small fraction of signs/symptoms and reverse their simulated value, i.e. generate some false
positive and false negative reports of signs/symptoms.
18

The accuracy of each method run on simulated data with reporting error is contained in
the right panel of Figure 1. Reporting error reduces the accuracy and increases the variance
in accuracy for both methods. The effect on InSilicoVA is relatively small with median
accuracy pulled down to ∼ 95%, while InterVA suffers dramatically with a median accuracy
of less than 40% and a large increase in accuracy variance.

3.2

Simulation 2: Compressed range of values in Ps|c

The second set of simulation studies investigates the performance of the two methods with
a modified set of conditional probabilities Ps|c . The Ps|c supplied with InterVA contains
very extreme values that range from [0, 1] inclusive. The extreme values in this table give
their corresponding signs/symptoms disproportionate influence that can overwhelm any/all
of the other signs/symptoms occurring with a death. This set of simulation studies is aimed
at understanding the effect of the extreme values in Ps|c . To accomplish this we retain
the log-linear relationship among the ordered values in Ps|c , but we draw new values for
each of the conditional probabilities from the range [0.25, 0.75]. We then repeat the same
three simulation studies described above. The results are shown in Figure 2. This change
significantly degrades the performance of both InSilicoVA and InterVA with reductions in
median accuracy and increases in accuracy variance. Yet across all scenarios InsilicoVA still
maintains a mean performance around 70 − 90% while InterVA drops to around 40 − 60%
with larger variance. Given this substantial reduction in accuracy, we also calculate accuracy
using the top three causes identified by each method. In practice it is still useful to have
the correct cause identified as one of the top three. Figure 3 displays accuracy allowing any
of the three most likely causes to agree with the true cause. Accuracy increases for both
algorithms, but InsilicoVA consistently outperforms InterVA by more than 10% and with
much smaller variance. This result indicates that InterVA relies on the extreme values in
Ps|c while InsilicoVA is more robust in situations where the conditional probabilities are less
informative.

HDSS sites

In this section we present results comparing InSilicoVA and InterVA using VA data from
two HDSS sites. Section 4.1 provides background information to contextualize the diverse
environments of the two sites, and Section 4.2 presents the results.

4.1

Background: Agincourt and Karonga sites

We apply both methods to VA data from two HDSS sites: the Agincourt health and sociodemographic surveillance system (Kahn et al., 2012) and the Karonga health and demographic surveillance system (Crampin et al., 2012).
The Agincourt site continuously monitors the population of about 31 villages located
in the Bushbuckridge subdistrict of Ehlanzeni District, Mpumalanga Province in northeast
South Africa. This is a rural population living in what was during Apartheid a black “homeland,” or Bantustan. The Agincourt HDSS was established in the early 1990s to guide the
reorganization of South Africa’s health system. Since then the site has functioned continuously and its purpose has evolved so that it now conducts health intervention trials and
contributes to the formulation and evaluation of health policy. The population covered by
the site is approximately 80,000 and vital events including deaths are updated annually. VA
interviews are conducted on every death occurring within the study population. We use
9,875 adult deaths from Agincourt from people of both sexes from 1993 to the present.
The Karonga site monitors a population of about 35,000 in northern Malawi near the port
village of Chilumba. The current system began with a baseline census from 2002–2004 and
has maintained continuous demographic surveillance. The Karonga site is actively involved
in research on HIV, TB, and behavioral studies related to disease transmission. Similar to
Agincourt, VA interviews are conducted on all deaths, and this work uses 1,469 adult deaths
from Karonga that have occurred in people of both sexes from 2002 to the present.

21

4.2

Results for HDSS sites

We fit our proposed model to VA data from both Agincourt and Karonga. We also fit InterVA
using the physician-generated conditional probabilities Ps|c as in Table 1 and the same prior
CSMFs ~π provided by the InterVA software (Byass, 2013). We removed external causes (e.g.,
suicide, traffic accident, etc.) because deaths from external causes usually have very strong
signal indicators and are usually less dependent on other symptoms. For InSilicoVA, we ran
three MCMC chains with different starting points. For each chain, we ran the sampler for
104 iterations, discarded the first 5, 000, and then thinned the chain using every twentieth
iteration. We ran the model in R and it took less than a day for Agincourt data and a
few hours for Karonga using a standard desktop machine. Visual inspection suggested good
mixing and we assessed convergence using Gelman-Rubin (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) tests.
Complete details of our convergence checks are provided in the Online Supplement.

Estimation comparing InsilicoVA to InterVA in two HDSS sites. Overall we see that InSilicoVA classifies
a larger proportion of deaths into ‘other/unspecified’ categories, reflecting a more conservative procedure
that is consistent with the vast uncertainty in these data. Point estimates represent the posterior mean and
intervals are 95% credible intervals.

The results from Agincourt and Karonga study are presented in Figure 4. InSilicoVA
is far more conservative and produces confidence bounds, whereas InterVA does not. A
key difference is that InSilicoVA classifies a larger portion of deaths to causes labeled in
various “other” groups. This indicates that these causes are related to either communicable

22

or non-communicable diseases, but there is not enough information to make a more specific
classification. This feature of InSilicoVA identifies cases that are difficult to classify using
available data and may be good candidates for additional attention, such as physician review.
We view this behavior as a strength of InSilicoVA because it is consistent with the
fundamental weakness of the VA approach, namely that both the information obtained from
a VA interview and the expert knowledge and/or gold standard used to characterize the
relationship between signs/symptoms and causes are inherently weak and incomplete, and
consequently it is very difficult or impossible to make highly specific cause assignments using
VA. Given this, we do not want a method that is artificially precise, i.e. forces fine-tuned
classification when there is insufficient information. Hence we view InSilicoVA’s behavior as
reasonable, “honest” (in that it does not over interpret the data) and useful. “Useful” in
the sense that it identifies where our information is particularly weak and therefore where
we need to apply more effort either to data or to interpretation.

5

Physician coding

The information available across contexts that use VA varies widely. One common source
of external information arises when a team of physicians reviews VA data and assigns a
likely cause to each death. Since this process places additional demands on already scarce
physician time, it is only available for some deaths. Unlike a gold standard dataset where
physician information is used as training data for an algorithm, a physician code is typically
used as the definitive classification. Coding clinicians do not have access to the decedent’s
body to perform a more detailed physical examination, as in a traditional autopsy.
We propose incorporating physician coded deaths into our hierarchical modeling framework. This strategy provides a unified inference framework for population cause distributions
based on both physician coded and non-physician coded deaths. We address two challenges
in incorporating these additional sources of data. First, available physician coded data often

23

do not match causes used in existing automated VA tools such as InterVA. For example in
the Karonga HDSS site physicians code deaths in a list of 88 categories and need to be aggregated into broader causes to match InterVA causes. Second, each physician uses her/his
own clinical experience, and often a sense of context-specific disease prevalences, to code
deaths, leading to variability and potentially bias. In Section 5.1 we present our approach
to addressing these two issues. We then present results in Section 5.2.

5.1

Physician coding framework

In this section we demonstrate how to incorporate physician coding into the InSilicoVA
method. If each death were coded by a single physician using the same possible causes of
death as in our statistical approach, the most straightforward means of incorporating this
information would be to replace the yi for a given individual with the physician’s code. This
strategy assumes that a physician can perfectly code each death using the information in a
VA interview. In practice it is difficult for physicians to definitively assign a cause using the
limited information from a VA interview. Multiple physicians typically code each death to
form a consensus. Further the possible causes used by physicians do not match the causes
used in existing automated methods. In the data we use, physicians first code based on six
broad cause categories, then assign deaths to more specific subcategories. Since we wish
to use clinician codes as an input into our probabilistic model rather than as a final cause
determination, we will use the broad categories from the Karonga site. Since our data are
only for adults we removed the category “infant deaths.” We are also particularly interested
in assignment in large disease categories, such as TB or HIV/AIDS, so we add and additional
category for these causes. The resulting list is: (i) non-communicable disease (NCD), (ii)
TB or AIDS, (iii) other communicable disease, (iv) maternal cause, (v) external cause or (vi)
unknown. The WHO VA standards (World Health Organization, 2012) map the causes of
death used in the previous section to ICD-10 codes, which can then be associated with these
six broad categories. We now have a set of broad cause categories {1, ..., G} that physicians
24

use and a way to relate these general causes to several causes of death used by InSilicoVA.
We further assume that we know the probability that a death is related to a cause in each
of these broad cause categories. That is, we have a vector of a rough COD distribution for
P
each death: Zi = (zi1 , ..., ziG ) and g zig = 1. In situations where each death is examined
by several physicians, we can use the distribution of assigned causes across the physicians.
When only one physician reviews the death, we place all the mass on the Zi term representing
the broad category assigned by that one physician. An advantage of our Bayesian approach
is that we could also distribute mass across other cause categories if we had additional
uncertainty measures. We further add a latent variable ηi ∈ {1, ..., G} indicating the category
assignment. The posterior of Y then becomes

P (yi |π, Si , Zi ) =

P (yi |π, ηi = g)P (ηi = g|Zi )

A certain level of physician bias is inevitable, especially when physicians’ training, exposure, and speciality vary. Some physicians are more likely to code certain causes than others,
particularly where they have clinical experience in the setting and a presumed knowledge of
underlying disease prevalences. We adopt a two-stage model to incorporate uncertainties in
the data and likely bias in the physician codes. First we use a separate model to estimate

25

the bias of the physician codes and obtain the de-biased cause distribution for each death.
Then, we feed the distribution of likely cause categories (accounting for potential bias) into
InsilicoVA to guide the algorithm.
For the first stage we used the model for annotation bias in document classification
proposed by Salter-Townshend and Murphy (2013). The algorithm was proposed to model
the annotator bias in rating news sentiment, but if we think of each death as a document
with symptoms as words and cause of death as the sentiment categories, the algorithm can be
directly applied to VA data with physician coding. Suppose there are M physicians in total,

and for each death i there are Mi physicians coding the cause. Let Zi = zi1 , zi2 , ..., ziG

be the code of death i by physician m, where zig = 1 if death i is assigned to cause g and
o
n
(m)
0 otherwise. The reporting bias matrix θgg0 for each physician is then defined as the
probability of assigning cause g 0 when the true cause is g. If we also denote the binary
indicator of true cause of death i to be Ti = {ti1 , ti2 , ..., tiG }, the conditional probability of
observing symptom j given cause g as pj|g , and the marginal probability of cause g as πg ,
then the complete data likelihood of physician coded dataset is:

After convergence, the estimator tˆig can then be used in place of zig in the main algorithm
as discussed in Section 2.1. An alternative would be to develop a fully Bayesian strategy to
address bias in physician coding. We have chosen not to do this because the VA data we have
is usually interpreted by a small number of physicians who assign causes to a large number
of deaths. Consequently there is a large amount of information about the specific tendencies of each physician, and thus the physician-specific bias matrix can be estimated with
limited uncertainty. A fully Bayesian approach would involve estimating many additional
parameters, but sharing information would be of limited value because there are many cases
available to estimate the physician-specific matrix. We believe the uncertainty in estimating
the physician-specific matrix is very small compared to other sources of uncertainty.

5.2

Comparing results using physician coding

We turn now to results that incorporate physician coding. We implemented the physician
coding algorithm described above on the Karonga dataset described in Section 4.1. The
Karonga site has used physician and clinical officer coding from 2002 to the present. The
1,469 deaths in our data have each been reviewed by clinicians. Typically each death is
reviewed by two clinicians; deaths where the two disagree are reviewed by a third. Over the
27

period of this analysis, 18 clinicians reviewed an average of 217 deaths each.

Estimation comparing InterVA with and without physician coding for the Karonga
dataset. InSilicoVA without physician coding categorizes many more deaths as
‘Other and unspecified infectious diseases’ compared to InterVA. Including physician coding reduces the fraction of deaths in this category, indicating an increase
in certainty about some deaths. Point estimates represent the posterior mean and
intervals are 95% credible intervals.

We first evaluate the difference in CSMFs estimated with and without incorporating
physician-coded causes. We use the six broad categories of clinician coding described in Section 5.1. Figure 5 compares the CSMFs using InSilicoVA both with and without physician
coding. Including physician coding reduces the fraction of deaths coded as other/unspecified
infectious diseases and increases the fraction of deaths assigned to HIV/AIDS. This is likely
the result of physicians with local knowledge being more aware of the complete symptom
profile typically associated with HIV/AIDS in their area. They may also gather useful data
from the VA narrative that aids them in making a decision on cause of death. Having
seen multiple cases of HIV/AIDS, physicians can leverage information from combinations of
symptoms that is much harder to build into a computational algorithm. Physicians can also
use knowledge of the prevalence of a given condition in a local context. If the majority of
deaths they see are related to HIV/AIDS, they may be more likely to assign HIV/AIDS as

Each 6 × 6 square matrix represents a single physician coding verbal autopsy deaths from the
Karonga HDSS. Within each matrix, the shading of each cell corresponds to the propensity of
the physician to classify the death into the cause category associated with the cell’s row when
the the true cause category is the one associated with the cell’s column. The physician bias
estimates come from comparing cause assignments for the same death produced by multiple
physicians. A physician with no individual bias would have solid black on the diagonal. The
figure indicates that the variation in both the nature and magnitude of individual physician
bias varies substantially between physicians.

a cause even in patients with a more general symptom profile.
Figure 6 shows the estimated physician-specific bias matrices for the nine physicians
coding the most deaths. Since each physician has unique training and experience, we expect
that there will be differences between physicians in the propensity to assign a particular
cause, even among physicians working in the same clinical context. Figure 6 displays the
n
o
(m)
θgg0 matrix described in Section 5.1. The shading of each cell in the matrix represents
the propensity of a given physician to code a death as the cause category associated with its
29

row, given that the true cause category is the cause category associated with its column. If
all physicians coded with no individual variation, all of the blocks would be solid black along
the diagonal. Figure 6 shows that there is substantial variability between the physicians
in terms of the degree of their individual proclivity to code specific causes. This variation
is especially persistent in terms of non-communicable diseases, indicating that physicians’
unique experiences were most influential in assigning non-communicable diseases.

Discussion

Assigning a cause(s) to a particular death can be challenging under the best circumstances.
Inferring a cause(s) given the limited data available from sources like VA in many developing
nations is an extremely difficult task. In this paper we propose a probabilistic statistical
framework for using VA data to infer an individual’s cause of death and the population cause
of death distribution and quantifying uncertainty in both. The proposed method uses a data
augmentation approach to reconcile individuals’ causes of death with the population cause of
death distribution. We demonstrate how our new framework can incorporate multiple types
of outside information, in particular physician codes. However, many open issues remain. In
our data, we observe all deaths in the HDSS site. Inferring cause of death distributions at a
national or regional level, however, would require an adjustment for sampling. If sampling
weights were known, we could incorporate them into our modeling framework. In many
developing nations, however, there is limited information available to construct such weights.
We conclude by highlighting two additional open questions. For both we stress the importance of pairing statistical models with data collection. First, questions remain about the
importance of correlation between symptoms in inferring a given cause. In both InSilicoVA
and InterVA the product of the marginal probability of each cause is used to approximate
the joint distribution of the entire vector of a decedent’s symptoms. This assumption ignores potentially very informative information about comorbidity between signs/symptoms,

30

i.e. dependence in the manifestation of signs/symptoms. Physician diagnosis often relies
on recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms combined with absence of others.
Advances in statistical tools for modeling large covariance matrices through factorizations
or projections could provide ways to model these interactions. Information describing these
dependencies needs to be present in Ps|c , the matrix of conditional probabilities associating
signs/symptoms and causes elicited from physicians. Until now physicians have not been
asked to produce this type of information and there does not exist an appropriate data collection mechanism to do this. When producing the Ps|c matrix, medical experts are only
asked to provide information about one cause at a time. Obtaining information about potentially informative co-occurences of signs/symptoms is essential but will involve non-trivial
changes to future data collection efforts. It is practically impossible to ask physicians about
every possible combination of symptoms. A key challenge, therefore, will be identifying
which combinations of symptoms could be useful and incorporating this incomplete association information into our statistical framework. The Ps|c matrix entries are also currently
solicited by consensus and without uncertainty. Adding uncertainty is straightforward in
our Bayesian framework and would produce more realistic estimates of uncertainty for the
resulting cause assignment and population proportion estimates.
Second, the current VA questionnaire is quite extensive and requires a great deal of time,
concentration and patience to administer. This burden is exacerbated since interviewees
have recently experienced the death of a loved one or close friend. Further, many symptoms occur either very infrequently or extremely frequently across multiple causes of death.
Reducing the number of items on the VA questionnaire would ease the burden on respondents and interviewers. This change would likely improve the overall quality of the data,
allowing individuals to focus more on the most influential symptoms without spending time
on questions that are less informative. Reducing the number of items on the questionnaire
and prioritizing the remaining items would accomplish this goal. Together the increasing
availability of affordable mobile survey technologies and advances in item-response theory,

related areas in statistics, machine learning, and psychometrics provide an opportunity to
create a more parsimonious questionnaire that dynamically presents a personalized series of
questions to each respondent based on their responses to previous questions.
