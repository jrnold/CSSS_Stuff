Abstract
The current practice for determining market price of a real estate often relies on selecting a
list of comparable sales and does not employ modern statistical techniques. The example
in this paper demonstrates how one could use statistical modeling in estimating the market
value of a real estate. This paper illustrates a real estate market analysis via a statistical
modeling case study which allows one not only to estimate the market value of a real
estate but also to learn some characteristics of the market. The statistical analysis scheme
presented fits naturally in the common practice used by real estate agents as it relies on
identified comparable sales as the starting point.

Introduction

When people are buying or selling real estate, there are numerous considerations that
determine answers to the seller’s question, “What should I ask for this condo?” or the
buyer’s question, “How much should I pay for this house?”, many of them are strictly
personal. Despite multiplicity of personal circumstances, everyone would like to know
what is the current market price of the property they are considering to buy or sell.
Market value is the amount of money a buyer, willing but not obligated to buy, would
pay to a seller willing but not obligated to sell. The most common answer that real
estate agents give to the question about the market value is the following: “It is what the
market will bear.” In other words, we don’t know the market value until the place is sold.
A standard way real estate agents deal with this problem is to perform an analysis of a
number of comparable recent sales. This analysis most often contains two steps. First,
recent sales on properties comparable to the property under consideration are selected.
Comparable properties are defined as those of a similar type and being located in the
same or a comparable neighborhood. Naturally, variations in what can be considered as
recent sales, similar property types and comparable neighborhoods are common. In the
second step, an approximate market value for the property of interest is calculated by
averaging the prices of those sales.
This paper illustrates a real estate market analysis via a statistical modeling case
study which allows one not only to estimate the market value of a real estate but also
to learn some characteristics of the market. This type of analysis goes back to Rosen’s
hedonic regression [1] which is based on decomposing the housing values into the values
of its constituent characteristics. The statistical analysis scheme presented in this paper
uses hierarchical regression techniques to control for nested structure of the data. Our
approach is attractive because it is simple and fits naturally in the common practice used
by real estate agents as it relies on identified comparable sales as the starting point.

Data set

This analysis originated from our personal experience as potential buyers. The main
question of interest was the market price of a condominium property in a Seattle neighborhood. Several real estate agents indicated that the listing was probably overpriced but
none would give us an estimate by how much. The situation was rather complex since
only a few truly comparable sales were available because of specific characteristics of the
property and the neighborhood. The property was a condominium unit in a small 11-year
old building situated in a single-family residential neighborhood. In these circumstances,
a real estate agent could consider extending the selection of comparable sales by going
further back in time, by including slightly different types of property, and/or by expanding the choice of comparable neighborhoods. For example, our agent added to the list
properties with similar descriptions but very different construction times and properties
from other neighborhoods. The list of comparable sales therefore contained a mix of
1

completely new and much older buildings, properties located nearby and properties from
different neighborhoods, units from small buildings and units from large condominium
complexes. Therefore, we felt that the traditional data-based approach based on the
extended list of comparable sales was unreliable for this property.
Although the shortage of comparable sales presents a problem for the traditional sales
comparison analysis, these circumstances can be circumvented via statistical modeling.
The idea is to start with a few recent sales on truly comparable properties but expand
the sales data in a systematic fashion by allowing variations on selected characteristics,
and account for those variations in a model. For example, since in our case the property
of interest and all truly comparable sales were condominium units in small buildings, the
data set was expanded to also include prior sales on all comparable units and include sales
on other, different size units in these buildings.
The resulting data set contained sales of units from five 8- to 13-year old condominium
buildings which we label A through E (Table 1). The property of interest is unit 2 in
building E which was sold only once 10 years ago. Two sales of the units in building B
had suspiciously low values. Unreasonably low sale values can happen in several ways,
such as when a sale is being done to a relative. These two units were excluded from the
analysis. The resulting data set contained a total of 30 sales on 15 units. The largest
number of sales per unit was four.
There were three levels of nesting structure in the data: buildings, units, and sales,
with some units having only one sale. Available characteristics of the buildings were: the
year it was built, construction quality (good or average for our sample), and construction
appeal (above average or average for our sample). Characteristics of the units were:
square footage and quality of view from the unit (no, fair, or good). Finally, sale-specific
variables included sale prices and times. Sales times were obtained by combining the year
and the month of a sale:
time = year + month/12.

Statistical models

We have considered a number of fixed- and mixed-effects models for this data set. Finding
a statistical model which fits the data well can allow us to obtain a predicted value for the
sale price of the unit of interest, given the unit’s characteristics. The response variable,
logpriceijk , is the logarithm of the sale price of unit j in building i at time k. Five different
models fitted to the data are summarized below.
1. Regression model 1:
logpriceijk = β0 + β1 timeijk + β2 yearbuildi + β3 sqf tij
+β4 appeali + β5 qualityi + β6 viewij + ²ijk ,
where ²ijk ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) residuals.

2. Since the data set contains repeated measures on units, residuals on the same units
can be more correlated than residuals on different units. This scenario is possible
when units have distinct features that aren’t taken into account by the unit-level
variables in the data which make them more/less attractive to potential buyers,
e.g., orientation of windows or a private street entrance. Model 2 takes this possible
dependence into account by including a random intercept for each unit. Model 2 is
formulated as
logpriceijk = β0 + γij + β1 timeijk + β2 yearbuildi + β3 sqf tij
+β4 appeali + β5 qualityi + β6 viewij + ²ijk ,
where ²ijk ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) are i.i.d. residuals, γij ∼ N (0, σ12 ) are i.i.d. unit-specific
random intercepts.
3. Similarly, residuals from sales on units in the same building can be more correlated
than residuals from sales on units in different buildings due to unavailable buildingspecific features. To take these deviations into account, we introduce a random
intercept for each building in model 3:
logpriceijk = β0 + γi + β1 timeijk + β2 yearbuildi + β3 sqf tij
+β4 appeali + β5 qualityi + β6 viewij + ²ijk ,
where ²ijk ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) are i.i.d. residuals, γi ∼ N (0, σ22 ) are i.i.d. building-specific
random intercepts.
4. Since there are only 5 buildings in the data set, another way to adjust for unavailable
building-specific features is by introducing building-specific fixed effects, βi1 , i =
1, . . . , 5. For model 4, one needs to remove other fixed-effects that are building-level
characteristics:
logpriceijk = β0 + βi1 + β1 timeijk + β3 sqf tij + β6 viewij + ²ijk ,
where ²ijk ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) are i.i.d. residuals. Similarly to model 3, model 4 would allow
one to account for building-specific differences but the model interpretation would
only apply to buildings in the data.
5. One could account for both, unit-specific and building-specific deviations by using
two random intercepts. Model 5 is:
logpriceijk = β0 + γij + γi + β1 timeijk + β2 yearbuildi + β3 sqf tij
+β4 appeali + β5 qualityi + β6 viewij + ²ijk ,
where ²ijk ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) are i.i.d. residuals, γij ∼ N (0, σ12 ) are i.i.d. unit-specific
deviations, and γi ∼ N (0, σ22 ) are i.i.d. building-specific random intercepts.

To calculate AIC and BIC statistics, SAS Proc Mixed uses as the number of parameters
p the number of fixed effects plus the number of covariance parameters; the number
of observations n for mixed-effects models is the number of highest-level random-effects
units.

Results

First, models with random effects were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood
to obtain valid statistical tests for variance parameters. Estimates of variances of the
random effects were not significantly different from zero in any of the models. This
finding implies that after taking available characteristics of the buildings and units into
account and adjusting for sales’ times, no within-unit dependence is left in our data set.
This conclusion is true for both nesting levels, buildings and individual condos. Therefore,
a simple linear regression framework can adequately model the sales data.
Goodness of fit After making conclusions about the random effects, models were estimated using maximum likelihood to compare fit statistics and to interpret fixed effects
estimates. The fit statistics are given in Table 2. Note that the inclusion of random
effects does not change the log-likelihood and AIC, but does change BIC because of
the computational convention for the number of observations used in SAS Proc Mixed.
Model 4 with building-specific fixed-effects has the lowest values of the log-likelihood and
goodness of fit criteria. However, the most parsimonious model 1 contains characteristics
of buildings instead of building-specific fixed effects and has only a small disadvantage
in the log-likelihood value compared to model 4. Model 4 AIC is lower than that of
model 1, whereas BIC is lower for model 1. Therefore, we will use results from model 1
for interpretation and results from model 4 for prediction.
Model 1 Significant effects in model 1 include time of sale, square footage of the unit,
appeal, and view from the unit. Note that effects of building quality and the year when
the building was built are non-significant. We find that a presence of a view can give
as much as 26% contribution relative to the price of a place without a view, everything
else held equal, whereas the difference between fair and good view is negligible. Above

average building appeal can contribute about 16% of the price relative to just an average
appeal, everything else held equal.
We can also obtain the appreciation rate from the estimated effect of time. Let price0
be the predicted value for the market price of a unit at time 0, and price1 be the predicted
value for the market price of a unit after a year, then
price1 = price0 ∗ exp(0.0573) = price0 ∗ 1.0590.
Hence, the estimated appreciation rate is about 5.9% which was comparable to the average
appreciation rate in that neighborhood of Seattle.
Overall, model 1 fits surprisingly well, given that real estate decisions are highly subjective and can be influenced by many more factors than those incorporated in the model.
The adjusted R-squared is 0.938. Only two sales, number 29 and 20, which happened
4 and 10 years ago, have standardized residuals that are greater than 2. Sale 20 is also
the most influential observation with the Cook’s distance of about 0.4. Sales 3 and 8
are classified as influential as well using the cut-off point of 4/30. Sale number 3 is the
only recorded sale of the property of interest. Comparing predicted ‘market price’ from
model 1 with observed sale values, we observe that the influential observations have positive influence on the sale price. We can leave the influential observations in the model
keeping in mind that the model will produce a conservative estimate of the amount by
which the condo is overpriced.
Model 4 After adding the building-specific fixed-effects, the estimates of the coefficients
for time and square footage variables do not change. The effect of the presence of view
is slightly lower compared to that estimated in model 1, but a view can still increase the

price by about 24%, everything else held equal. Model 4 implies a similar interpretation
of the fixed effects as model 1.
The F-statistic for building-specific effects is 3.91 with (4,21) degrees of freedom (pvalue=0.0158). Hence, at least one building has a significant effect on the sale prices.
Notice that the effect of building E was taken to be the baseline, and all other buildings
have positive coefficient estimates which implies that sale prices in building E are lower
compared to other buildings, given that all other unit characteristics are the same.
Model 4 has no standardized residuals that are greater than 2. Sales number 20, 28
and 23 are influential cases with the largest Cook’s distance of about .32 for case 20. The
fit of the model is excellent: the adjusted R-squared is 0.95.
Predicted market price Let’s use model 4 to obtain estimated market prices. Figure 1
compares observed sale prices with market prices estimated by the model on the log scale.
Circles represent observed cases, enumerated as in Table 1. Since circles cluster close to
the 45-degrees line, estimated market prices from the model correspond to sale prices very
well. To address the question how would the model predict market price for a new data
point, let’s consider three most recent sales from the data, re-estimate the model using the
respective prior sales, and obtain predictions for the recent sales. Cases 23, 19, and 30 are
three most recent sales which took place within the last half a year; these are indicated
by filled circles in Figure 1. The corresponding predicted prices are indicated by empty
triangles in Figure 1. The observed sale prices for cases 23, 19, and 30 are very close to
the predicted values; they all fall within two standard deviations from the corresponding
predictions. Thus, the model does a good job in predicting sale prices for these recent
cases.

This analysis was done when the unit of interest was still on the market, and only
the list price was known. The point-up filled triangle in Figure 1 represents the list price
(on the sale price axis) for the unit of interest versus the estimated market price from
model 4. The market price estimate for the sale in question from model 1 was very similar
in its value and standard error. It is obvious that the property in question is drastically
overpriced. Based on the model, there is little hope that the sale price will be close to the
list price for this condominium. Chances are less than 2 in 1000 that the sale price for
the unit of interest will reach or surpass the list price. In this case, an informed potential
buyer would find it difficult to make a reasonable offer that would not be considered highly
offensive by the seller.

Conclusions

This paper presents an example of a real estate market analysis for a condominium unit
in Seattle. We consider basic characteristics of condominium units and apply regression
techniques to estimate sale prices adjusting for differences in the recorded characteristics.
An expanded list of comparable sales provided by a real estate agent is used as a starting point for data selection. Next, we only keep those sales that are truly comparable,
include respective prior sales, and sales on condominium units in the same buildings. We
use hierarchical regression techniques to control for the resulting nested data structure.
Estimating price indices for residential property, Clapp and Giaccotto [2] also considered to combine one-time and repeat sales, and used seemingly unrelated regression for
estimation.
The idea of decomposing housing values into the values of its constituent characteristics goes back to Rosen’s hedonic demand theory [1]. It finds numerous applications in
estimating implicit values of different housing qualities such as neighborhood presence of
popular secondary schools [3], clean air [4], and landscape visibility [5]. A recent trend
in statistical analysis of sale prices focuses on effective spacial-temporal modeling of large
data sets which capitalizes on large amounts of data including sale transaction records
and detailed property characteristics [6, 7, 8]. Despite recent advances in statistical modeling, the day-to-day practice for determining market price of a real estate relies only on
basic statistical techniques. The approach presented in this paper does not require large
data bases, it is simple, it is personalized to each individual property through a careful
selection of relevant transactions, and it fits naturally in the common practice used by
real estate agents as it relies on identified comparable sales as the starting point.
The predicted market price and estimates of uncertainty implied by the model provide
a solid ground for informative decision-making. This type of information can be very
useful when supported by personal circumstances such as a personal financial situation,
a desirability of the real estate, a likely duration of the ownership, a current state of the
real estate market, and others. The modeling approach allows one to avoid relying on the
average value over an unrealistically expanded list of comparable transactions when only
a few recent sales can be deemed as truly comparable. In addition, examining statistical
9

models allows one to draw conclusions about the behavior of the real estate market.
The first surprising finding from the analysis is that data on such general characteristics
as presence or absence of a view, building appeal, time of sale, and square footage, allow us
to build a model which fits the condo sales data very well. Second, even though observed
sales were clustered within condo units that themselves were clustered within buildings,
contrary to our expectations, no significant residual dependence is detected at either the
unit- or the building-level. Incorporating building-specific effects in the model instead of
building characteristics does not improve the model significantly. Hence, it is the building
appeal which accounts for most of the variability between different buildings. The age of
a building in the range of 8-13 years old does not effect the price significantly, and there
is no significant change in price between good and average quality of the building. Since
the data set in this analysis is limited to relatively recent small building condominium
units in a single-family neighborhood in Seattle, the conclusions we draw apply to this
specific share of the market.
The data-based approach of estimating the market value described here can be utilized
not only for making decisions when buying or selling real estate but also for making
property assessments for tax purposes. King County’s Department of Assessments states
that “assessment for tax purposes means establishing the full market value” which, for
residential parcels, is determined by “analyzing recent sales of comparable properties in
the same area” (http://www.metrokc.gov/assessor/RealProperty.htm, updated Feb. 23,
1999). The statistical modeling approach which avoids aggregating data beyond recent
sales of properties that are truly comparable can be clearly useful in establishing the full
market value for tax purposes.

Epilog

After more than five months on the market, the condo was sold at a price which is
indicated in Figure 1 by a square. Based on the model, the chances of having the sale
price as high or higher are about 4 in 1000. What are some possible explanations for such
an unlikely event?
Note that the list price was very high to begin with. A rumor has it that the seller’s
agent did not notice the sale of a comparable unit in the same building that happened
just a year ago, which could be one factor in placing such a high list price. In addition,
assuming that most owners of comparable condominium units in urban Seattle are young
professionals, they usually sell their place and quickly move on to a new location. Since
the seller did not fit this profile and did not seem to be under pressure to sell the place
quickly, the sale in question might have been quite different from other sales in the data in
that respect. The marketing strategy for the sale in question could be at the one extreme
which is to drastically overprice and be ready to wait longer, whereas the marketing
strategy for other sales in the data could be at the other extreme which is to price near
perceived market value to attract the maximum number of potential bids and sell quickly.
Given that the list price was so high, the buyer might have perceived it as an indicator
10

of quality. Another possible incentive for the buyer could be market behavior; loan rates
began to increase quickly about two weeks before the sale took place. Finally, a rumor
has it that the seller lowered the list price after some time on the marked which eventually
resulted in a multiple offer situation and inflated the sale price. Whether the price reliance
effects, market conditions, personal circumstances or some combination of these and other
factors is the correct explanation for this sale, the outcome might have been different if
the results of this analysis were readily available to all.
