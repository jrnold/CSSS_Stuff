Abstract:
Standard estimates of the NAIRU or natural rate of unemployment are subject to
considerable uncertainty. We show in this paper that using multiple indicators to extract
an estimated NAIRU cuts in half uncertainty as measured by variance and a 29 percent
reduction in the confidence band. The inclusion of an Okun’s Law relation is particularly
valuable. The essential notion is the existence of a common cyclical force driving the
macroeconomic variables. Model comparisons based on the use of Bayes factors favor
the idea of a common cyclical component.

Keywords: NAIRU, unemployment, inflation, parametric uncertainty, filtering
uncertainty.

1. Introduction
A prerequisite for the conduct of countercyclical macroeconomic policy is to know
where we are in the cycle – loosely, are we above or below the NAIRU? Measuring the
natural rate and the corresponding cyclical fluctuations of the US economy with
reasonable precision poses a significant challenge. Our aim in this paper is to reduce
uncertainty about the NAIRU by employing a multiple indicator approach. The essential
notion is that the concept of “a business cycle” is meaningful in that there is a single
“gap” which drives cyclical behavior across sectors and across variables. By employing a
number of indicators jointly we are able to significantly improve the precision of
estimates of the NAIRU, reducing uncertainty by about half.
While our primary interest is in reducing uncertainty about the NAIRU, we confront
three related issues along the way. The first issue is the need for care in measuring
uncertainty for a target, such as the NAIRU, which is itself unobserved. For our purposes
the resolution is to use standard models from the literature as benchmarks. The second
issue is the so-called “pile-up” problem, where the Kalman filter puts too little weight on
the variance of the permanent component. Where the goal is to find point estimates of the
NAIRU as an unobserved component, the pile-up problem is an annoyance that has been
dealt with by imposing reasonable values on the variance parameters. This solution is
unsatisfactory when the goal is to measure uncertainty, because picking a value for the
variance comes too close to picking a value for total uncertainty. Fortunately, our
multivariate approach seems to eliminate the pile-up problem. The third issue is how to
compare NAIRU estimates computed from models which have considerable variation in

3

complexity and are non-nested. We use the Bayes factor approximation based on the
Schwarz criterion as discussed in Kass and Raftery (1995)).
We treat the NAIRU as an unobserved component to be estimated by the Kalman
filter. Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997a, hereafter SSW (1997a)) points out three sources
of uncertainty in a state-space setup. The first source of uncertainty is the model
uncertainty arising from incomplete knowledge about the true model. The second source
is the parametric uncertainty due to estimation of the parameters of the model from a
sample. The final source is unpredictable stochastic shocks to the NAIRU, also called
filtering uncertainty.
We begin with a discussion of model uncertainty and identification in the context of
trying to predict an unobserved component. Measuring uncertainty about an unobserved
component adds a twist that isn’t present in the discussion about uncertainty in
forecasting an ex post observable variable. Suppose the econometrician is attempting to
predict an ex post observable variable. For an observable variable, it is only a mild
exaggeration to say that whatever model gives the tightest forecast confidence intervals is
the best model. For an unobservable variable the econometrician still wants a tight
confidence interval, but confidence intervals are comparable only across models using the
same stochastic specification for the unobserved NAIRU and gap. One needs to separate
arguments about improved prediction from arguments that are really about appropriate
models. In other words, a tight confidence interval for an incorrectly defined NAIRU
isn’t very useful. 1 However, for any given specification a multiple indicator approach has

1

If tight confidence intervals alone were a sufficient criterion, then further research to identify the NAIRU
would be unnecessary, at least for the United States. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act declared full
employment level of unemployment to be exactly 4 percent.

4

the potential to improve precision. 2 Our solution is to start with standard models in the
literature and show that using multiple indicators can significantly reduce the variance.
There are two genres of identification restrictions used in the literature. One set of
restrictions describes the statistical behavior of the natural rate, for example that the gap
averages zero. The other set of restrictions uses the Phillips curve and identifies the gap
as the variable that drives a wedge between expected and realized inflation. In particular,
we follow SSW (1997a) in making this distinction. Laubach (2001) showed that the
NAIRU uncertainty can be reduced by using both kinds of identifying restrictions. We
use Laubach’s models as a launching point.
As a first model, suppose the natural rate is constant. A constant natural rate is a straw
man rather than a seriously tenable model. (See, for examples of time-varying NAIRU,
Summers (1986), Juhn, Topel and Murphy (1991), Gordon (1997, 1998), Shimer (1998),
and Ball and Mankiw (2002), to name only a few.) Nonetheless, two different estimates
of a constant NAIRU reinforce SSW (1997a)’s conclusion that it is very difficult to
estimate the natural rate precisely. First, suppose the identifying restriction is that the gap,
unemployment minus the NAIRU, averages zero. Then the constant NAIRU, NU , is
estimated as the sample mean of unemployment, perhaps weighted to account for serial
correlation or heteroskedasticity. In our data a regression of unemployment on a constant
with an AR(2) error process gives an NU of 5.90 with a standard error of 0.41. Second, a
constant NAIRU can be estimated as a parameter in the Phillips curve, Nπ . Using this
method the estimate is similar, 5.99 with a standard error of 0.49.

2

This approach has, of course, been employed in other settings. See for example, Avery (1979).

5

In what follows we decompose total uncertainty within a given model into the
components due to parametric uncertainty and filtering uncertainty. In general the portion
due to parametric uncertainty is fairly large, a result which is not surprising given the
large degree of uncertainty seen in the constant NAIRU model – where by definition
there is no filtering uncertainty. We show that moving to a multiple indicator model
reduces both parametric and filtering uncertainty as cross-equation correlations improve
the efficiency of estimates.
In section 2 we lay out our benchmark model, provide the estimates and show the
results on reduction of filtering uncertainty when moving from a univariate to a bivariate
approach. We augment our benchmark model in section 3 by estimating the NAIRU
shock variance. Thereafter we extend our model to multivariate frameworks sequentially
in section 4 and section 5. We summarize and conclude in section 6.

2. Reduction of filtering uncertainty using multiple indicators
2.1 Specifying the benchmark model
The straw men point estimates in the introduction are essentially identical. Informally
one might think of the conclusions from one estimate reinforcing those from the other,
where “reinforcing” means reducing uncertainty. In this section we formally combine the
two estimates, following Kuttner (1994) and Laubach (2001). This provides a benchmark
for the more extensive models given below. It also provides an opportunity to outline the
“Bayes factor” technique we use for model comparison.
In modeling the NAIRU, we follow the standard set-up of Gordon (1997), SSW
(1997a), Laubach (2001). The following equations form the basic model of NAIRU:

6

(1)

Δπ C ,t = β C ( L )Δπ C ,t −1 + γ C ( L ) (U t −1 − Nπ ,t −1 ) + δ C X t + ε C ,t

(2)

U t ≡ NU ,t + gU t

where L is the lag operator, Δπ C ,t is the first difference of inflation (calculated using the
CPI-all items), U t and N t are the observed civilian unemployment rate and the NAIRU
at time t . The term X t denotes a vector of supply shocks and gU t stands for the
unemployment gap. The supply shocks used throughout this paper are a dummy variable
for the Nixon price control era and the supply shocks measured by the difference between
CPI inflation and food and energy price inflation 3 .
Continuing the straw example, we can specify NU ,t = NU , Nπ ,t = Nπ , and that

gU t follows an AR(2) and then estimate equations (1) and (2) jointly under the
assumption of independent error terms across equations. This gives two independent
estimates for the natural rate and associated confidence intervals. Or we can make a
meaningfully joint estimate by imposing NU ,t = Nπ ,t .
2.2 Bayes factors for model comparison
In addition to seeing whether joint estimation reduces uncertainty, we want to ask
whether it does any particular violence to the data. Frequentist approaches have two
problems in this application. First, what should we do if the right-hand side specifications
are non-nested? (Although in the straw example the joint estimate is nested within the
independent estimates.) Second, classical testing is asymmetric in that strong evidence is
required to reject the null hypothesis.

3

We follow Gordon (1990) to construct the dummies for Nixon era price control and King and Watson
(1994) construct the supply shocks. The procedures are also mentioned in SSW (1997a).

7

The Bayes factor methodology suggested in the statistics literature solves these
problems by taking the approach of model comparison rather than hypothesis testing. We
end up comparing two models by a posterior probability that one model is favored over
the other. Right-hand side specifications need not be nested. What’s more, the
approximation presented by Kass and Raftery (1995) allows use of non-informative
priors for model estimation and equally weighted priors across independent and joint
models.
For a set of data D and two models M I and M J the Bayes factor
BJI =

Pr ( D M J )
Pr ( D M I )

gives the posterior odds and summarizes “the evidence provided by the data in favor of
one scientific theory, represented by a statistical model, as opposed to another.” (Kass
and Raftery (1995, page 777). Kass and Raftery, modifying an earlier suggestion by
Jeffries (1961), suggest the following standards for evaluating evidence.

8

where A (

is the maximized log-likelihood, d is the number of model parameters, and

n is the sample size, gives an approximation to the Bayes factor without specification of
an explicit prior. 2S can then be used with Table 1 to judge whether the independent or
joint is strongly preferred by the data. 4
2.3 Data, estimation and uncertainty in the constant NAIRU model
We use quarterly data from the first quarter of 1955 to the third quarter of 2003,
taken from Fred-II data base of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the DRI
database. Two lags of unemployment gap and two lags of CPI inflation difference proved
to be sufficient in the models. (The selection of lags is based on significance of the last
lag.)
Panel A of Table 2 gives the univariate results and Panel B of Table 2 gives
results for the constant NAIRU from the bivariate model that allows for model
comparison. Joint estimation with a single NAIRU restriction reduces the parametric
variance around the NAIRU by 60 percent. 5 The Bayes factor favors the single NAIRU
model. Using the standards set out in Table 1, the evidence against the two NAIRU
model is in the category ‘positive’.
2.4 A time-varying NAIRU model
If we specify the NAIRU to be a simple random walk (as in SSW (1997a),
Gordon (1997) and Laubach (2001)) and specify the gap as following an autoregressive

4
5

−2S is the Bayesian information criterion or BIC.
The asymptotic standard error for N π is 0.49, but because the estimate of the natural rate is derived by

dividing the intercept by γ C (1) the asymptotic approximation is likely to be poor. Following SSW (1997a),
we report the ‘Gaussian’ confidence interval at the 95 percent level to be between 4.8 percent and 7.5
percent and illustrated in Figure 1.

process of order two to allow for periodicity in the cycle measure, we have a potentially

Results appear in Table 3. 6 Panel A shows results for univariate estimates of the
NAIRU.

7

Panel B shows the bivariate estimate. We used the standard deviation of the

NAIRU shock as 0.2 (also used by Laubach (2001) for both estimates. A time-varying,
univariate, NAIRU model shows much higher reported total variance than does the
constant NAIRU model. Filtering uncertainty is the dominant source of uncertainty about
the NAIRU estimates. The estimates show that the parametric variance is only about six
percent of the total variance. In the table we also show the point estimates of NAIRU at
the beginning of last three decades along with its total standard deviation, parametric
standard deviation and filtering standard deviation. The NAIRU estimates and their 95
percent confidence interval are in Figure 2. Figure 2 also illustrates a main point – that
the NAIRU is very imprecisely estimated in the univariate model – by showing the large
confidence interval of the NAIRU.

6

Even though we have not changed the set of observables, estimates including (3) and (4) cannot be
compared to the previous models using the Bayes factor. Estimation of the Kalman filter where there are
nonstationary state variables involves an initialization which affects calculation of the log-likelihood
although it does not affect final estimates. For this reason, using the Bayes factor to compare models with
different numbers of nonstationary state variables is an unsolved problem.
7
State-space models using the Kalman filter generally assume normal errors. In principle this is
problematic because it implies that the unemployment rate is unbounded. One approach would be to model
the log of unemployment and then back out estimate of the level of the natural rate. As a practical matter
we found this to be an issue only in the univariate model. In calculating the filtering uncertainty using
Monte Carlo methods, we resampled if the standard deviation of the filtering uncertainty turned out to be
greater than 3 – which would put a less than zero NAIRU value within the 95 percent confidence interval
based on a 6 percent NAIRU. This meant 9 percent resampling in the univariate model but no resampling in
the all the following multivariate models. So, the uncertainty in the univariate model might be downward
biased, but there is no such bias in the multivariate models.

10

Joint estimates appear in Panel B. We observe a dramatic decrease in the average
total variance coming from a decline in both average parameter variance and average
filtering variance. Parametric uncertainty is reduced by a factor of five from the
univariate model. But the drop in filtering uncertainty is even greater and most of the
uncertainty in the previous model came from filtering, so reduction in filtering
uncertainty dominates by being approximately 95 percent of the decline in total variance.
The unemployment gap is fairly persistent; the sum of the autoregressive coefficients is
0.92.
In Figure 3, we show the estimates of NAIRU from the bivariate model along
with the 95 percent confidence interval. The graph shows that the gap estimates pick up
the shaded NBER recessions efficiently. The estimates of the NAIRU show a rise from
the mid 1970s and a decline starting in mid 1980s and keeping low throughout 1990s.
These features of the natural rate estimate are consistent with studies like Ball and
Mankiw (2002), Gordon (1997, 1998), Juhn, Topel and Murphy (1991), SSW (1997a,
1997b), Laubach (2001), Salemi (1999), Shimer (1998) Katz and Kruger (1999), and
Summers (1986).

3. The estimated NAIRU shock variance, its standard error and the NAIRU
uncertainty from the bivariate model
We now use the bivariate model described above in equations (1) – (4), generalize
the variance covariance matrix of the three shocks, ε C ,t , ε N ,t and

ε g ,t , and estimate the
U

matrix. This brings two advantages. Firstly, we estimate rather than fix the variance of
the shock to the NAIRU. The bivariate model gives us enough cross-equation
information to estimate the shock variance covariance matrix without the pile-up

11

problem. 8 Estimation of the shock variance provides a better estimate of filtering
uncertainty. The estimation also allows us to have the standard error of the estimated
variance of the NAIRU shock – which enters the calculation of parametric uncertainty.
The second motivation is due to the Morley, Nelson and Zivot (2003) (hereafter MNZ)
result that the estimates of the trend and cycle can be very sensitive to the correlation
structure of the shocks.
We faced a computational issue regarding parametric uncertainty while estimating
the above model. Estimation of the parameters did not pose any problems but the Hessian
of the parameter estimates turned out to be very unstable with respect to some covariance
parameter terms between the shocks (log likelihood function very flat for those
parameters). We took the following approach to address this problem: we estimated the
model with the generalized variance covariance matrix. We noted the off-diagonal
parameters with estimated values being close to zero and imprecisely estimated. Then we
restricted those off-diagonal parameters to zero and re-estimated the model. The
restricted model was used if it was not significantly different at the 90 percent after
comparing the log likelihood values. We follow this approach for the rest of the paper.
This effectively meant two restrictions in our model, i.e. the correlation between
inflation shock and gap shock and the correlation between inflation shock and natural rate
shock were restricted to zero. The log-likelihood difference was not significant at the 75
percent even for one restriction. The results are in Table 4. The standard deviation of the
shock to the NAIRU is 0.24, quite close to Laubach and ours imposed value of 0.20. The
NAIRU – unemployment gap shock correlation is -0.77, precisely estimated and supports

8

Elimination of the pile-up problem reflects, presumably, better identifying information. It’s not
necessarily tied to using a bivariate rather than univariate approach.

12

the MNZ result. The average total standard error is now 0.57 – a 20 percent rise over the
bivariate model in section 2. The Bayes factor favors this estimated standard deviation of
NAIRU shock model strongly against the imposed value model (Table 3, Panel B),
primarily due to allowing for natural rate and gap shock correlation.
The average parametric standard error doubles, from 0.14 in section 2 to 0.28 in
this model, since we now incorporate uncertainty about σ N which was previously
omitted. The filtering uncertainty increases marginally due to a higher value of the
variance of the shock to the NAIRU. The NAIRU estimates along with the 95 percent
confidence interval are shown in Figure 4. The estimates confirm our previous
observations.
4. The Estimation of NAIRU and its uncertainty from four variable models
4.1 The four variable model using GDP and GDP inflation
We now augment the bivariate model in Section 3 to a multivariate model by
using two more variables. We have one more inflationary measure based on GDP
(chained) deflator and real GDP. The real GDP (in natural logs), Yt , equation, following
Watson (1986), Kuttner (1994), MNZ (2003), is specified as a sum of a permanent
stochastic trend, TY t and the output gap, g y t :
(5)

Yt = TY t + g Y t .
The permanent stochastic trend follows a random walk with a constant drift and

the output gap follows a second order autoregressive process:
(6)

TY t = μY + TY t −1 + ε T

(7)

g Y t = φY 1 g Y t −1 + φY 2 g Y t −2 + ε g

Y

t

Y

,t

13

We specify the new inflation equation based on GDP deflator where Δπ G ,t is the first
difference of the GDP inflation rate depends on its own lags, lagged output gaps and
supply shocks. The supply shock based on King and Watson (1994) is measured as a
deviation from GDP inflation instead of CPI inflation.
(8)

Δπ G ,t = β G ( L)Δπ G ,t −1 + γ G ( L) g Y t −1 + δ G X t + ε G ,t

Finally, following Clark (1989), we link the output gap and the unemployment gap by a
dynamic version of Okun’s Law:
K

(9)

g U t = ∑θ Y , k g Y t − k
k =0

So, equations (1) – (9) together form a multivariate model of NAIRU estimation
where there is a single gap driving the dynamics of cyclical fluctuations in GDP and
unemployment. We will refer to this type model as the ‘single gap’ model. This idea of a
single gap or one common cycle is not new in the business cycle literature. Chauvet
(1998) used this in a regime switching context, Issler and Vahid (2001) used it in a VAR
context 9 and Stock and Watson (1989) used it in a multiple indicator common component
context to extract a measure of coincident index of business cycle. We will compare the
performance of the single gap model against alternative of using equations (1) - (8) as the
model of estimation. This omits the linkage equation (9) and allows two different
measures of gap – unemployment gap and output gap. We will denote this type of model
as the ‘multiple gap’ model. Since both models are defined over the same variables but
have different number of parameters, the Bayes factor can be used to discriminate
between the models.
9

Interestingly, Issler and Vahid (2001) show that using the common cycle restriction improves the
efficiency of the model.

14

The estimation results are reported in Table 5. Based on the significance of the
last lag, we used one lag (along with the contemporaneous) for equation (9). This is
consistent with the Clark (1989) framework. For equation (8) we had to use three lags of
GDP inflation differences and two lags of the output gap. Comparing the log likelihoods
between the single gap and multiple gap models – the multiple gap model has a higher
likelihood. However, it also has two more parameters 10 and the Bayes factor ‘positively’
favors the single gap model. The point estimate of standard deviation of the natural rate
shock is lower than our previous estimate but not significantly lower than 0.2. The
average total variance of the NAIRU estimates lower than before. This roughly translates
to 20 percent shrinkage of the confidence interval around NAIRU when compared with
Table 3.
We show the estimates of NAIRU and gaps from single gap and multiple gap
models in Figure 5. In the top left panel we have the NAIRU estimates from the single
gap model and on the top right panel we the NAIRU estimates from the multiple gap
model. They share very similar dynamics even though the confidence interval around the
multiple gap NAIRU is wider. Comparing the output gap estimates in the bottom left
panel, there is very little difference in between the output gap estimates from two models.
Finally, in the bottom right panel we show the unemployment gap estimates along with
the output gap from the multiple gap model. They seem to be strongly negatively related
with very similar dynamics.

10

The low and insignificant off-diagonal parameters of the lower triangular matrix based on Cholesky
decomposition of the variance covariance matrix of the shocks were restricted to zero using 90 percent
significance level.

15

4.2 The four variable model using employment and wage inflation
We now re-extend the bivariate model in Section 3 to a multivariate model by
using two other variables, employment and wage inflation. The employment level (in
logs), Lt , equation is a sum of a permanent, stochastic trend, TL t , and an employment
gap variable g Lt :
(10)

Lt = TL t + g Lt .

We assume the permanent, stochastic trend of the employment variable, TL t , follows a
random walk with a constant drift:
(11)

TL t = μ L + TL t −1 + ε T

L

t

The wage inflation equation also has a similar structure as our equation (1) in
Section 2 except that we use the employment gap instead of the unemployment gap:
(12)

Δπ W , t = βW ( L) Δπ W , t −1 + γ W ( L) g Lt + δW X t + ε W , t

In the above equation Δπ W ,t is the first difference of the wage inflation rate. The supply
shock is measured as a deviation from wage inflation. Our crucial element in this four
variable model is the specification of the employment gap. As in the model with GDP,
the multiple gap specification would imply a separate autoregressive stochastic process
for the employment gap:
(13)

g L t = φ L 1 g L t −1 + φ L 2 g L t − 2 + ε g L ,t .

The alternative of a single gap implies either the unemployment gap is dependent on the
employment gap or vice versa. Based on log-likelihood values and SICs, the specification
that the employment gap is a linear function of contemporaneous and lagged

16

unemployment gap seems a better description of the data. Therefore, the linkage equation
specifying the employment gap in the single gap model is:
M

(14)

g L t = ∑θ L, m gU t −m .
m =0

Equations (1) – (4), (10) – (12) and (14) now form our new single gap
multivariate model. The multiple gap model is denoted by equations (1) – (4) and (10) –
(13) and omits the linkage equation.

Based on significance of last lag, we used

contemporaneous and one lag of unemployment gap in equation (14). Similarly, we used
three lags of first differences in wage inflation and two lags of employment gaps in
equation (12). As before, we start our estimation with a generalized variance – covariance
matrix of the shocks and then restrict the off-diagonal parameters.
The estimates of the model are in Table 6. The multiple gap model has two more
parameters than the single gap model but the Bayes factor again favors the single gap
model. The parameter estimate of the standard deviation of the shock to the NAIRU is
0.19 and precisely estimated. The estimate of the standard deviation of the employment
trend shock is moderate and precise but lower than the estimate for GDP trend shock. The
correlation of the natural rate shock and the gap shock is negative. The drift term implies
a 1.7 percent annual employment growth.
More importantly, we see a similar drop in the NAIRU uncertainty as with GDP
although not as large in magnitude. The average total variance drops to 0.24 and this
translates to approximately 15 percent reduction in the confidence interval around
NAIRU. The top two panels of Figure 6 compare the NAIRU and uncertainty estimates
from the single gap and multiple gap model. They show very similar NAIRU dynamics in
the two panels and a slightly sharper confidence band in the top left panel depicting the

17

single gap case. The unemployment gap estimates from the two models in the bottom left
panel show very similar estimates. Similarly the bottom right panel comparing the
unemployment gap and employment gap estimates from the multiple gap model show the
expected inverse but very similar dynamics in both gaps.

4.3 Model comparisons of the four variable models
In this section we re-estimate the two four variable multiple gap models but
without allowing for any cross correlation between the components. For example, from
section 4.1 we estimate the multiple gap model with separate unemployment gap and
GDP gap and we do not allow the gaps to be correlated. We treat the two observable
variables in each gap estimation as a block with three unobserved components. We then
allow the correlation between components within a block to be identical with previous
estimation but restrict all the cross block correlations to be zero. This in effect extends the
bivariate model of NAIRU estimation to a four variable model without any external
influence on the estimation of NAIRU. Since model comparison using Bayes factor is
defined over identical observations, we can now compare the no cross correlation four
variable variation of the bivariate model to the four variable single gap model.
The results from estimating the two no cross correlation models are in Table 7.
The value of Bayes factor in the top panel, computed as evidence against multiple gap
model with no cross correlation in favor of the single gap model in Table 5, is 174 –
strong evidence favoring the single gap model. The estimates of the standard deviation to
the NAIRU shock and correlation of the NAIRU and unemployment gap shock are
almost identical to the bivariate model. The bottom panel of Table 7 also shows a similar

18

story using employment and wage inflation. The Bayes factor again is very large and the
evidence strongly favors the single gap model. The NAIRU estimates from these two
models are shown in Figure 7 along with the NAIRU from the bivariate model for
comparison. The estimates are almost identical. Overall, both the models imply that the
single gap model brings in important additional information over the bivariate model.

5. The Estimation of NAIRU and its uncertainty from six variable model
In this section we bring together the elements of Section 4 to incorporate the
information in the GDP, GDP inflation, employment and wage inflation simultaneously.
This results in a six variable model of NAIRU and we will compare the performance of
the single gap and the multiple gap models. The multiple gap model is given by equations
(1) – (8) and (10) – (13). For the single gap model, we re-specify the employment gap
equation as:
Q

(15)

g L t = ∑θ L, q g Y t −q .
q =0

The above equation essentially substitutes equation (9) in equation (14) and
reparameterizes the coefficients. Therefore equations (1) – (3), (5) – (12) and (15) make
the six variable single gap model. The lags in the equations are chosen as before.
5.1 Estimates from the six variable models
The estimates are given in Table 8. The SIC estimates reconfirm that the singlegap model strikes a better balance between number of parameters and log-likelihood
when compared to the multiple gap model. The point estimate of the standard deviation
of the NAIRU shock is 0.17 and precise. The standard deviation of the GDP trend shock
is higher than in Table 5 but their confidence intervals overlap quite a bit. The same true

19

for the correlation between trend shock and gap shock, which is higher in this model. The
standard deviation of the employment trend shock and the drift parameters are very
similar to our previous estimates. The Bayes factor strongly favors the single gap model
over the multiple gap model.
The average total variance of NAIRU declined further in this model – implying
approximately 29 percent reduction in the confidence band over the bivariate model.
Overall variance drops in half, from 0.33 to 0.16. This overall drop comes from roughly
equal proportional decreases in each component, the parametric variance dropping from
0.08 to 0.03 and the filtering variance dropping from 0.24 to 0.13. Since filtering variance
was considerably larger in terms of absolute level, most of the total decrease is due to the
reduction in filtering uncertainty. Note that a considerable part of the improvement in the
filtering uncertainty is due to the lower estimate of the NAIRU shock variance.
In Figure 8, the NAIRU estimates from the single gap model in the top left panel
are quite similar to previous estimates but the 95 percent confidence interval is narrower.
The NAIRU estimates from the multiple gap model are in the top right panel 11 .
Comparison of output gaps with the multiple gap model in the bottom left panel still
shows very similar output gap dynamics in both models. The bottom right panel
compares the dynamics of different gaps from the multiple gap model. The employment
gap and the output gap show similar dynamics whereas unemployment gap show inverse
dynamics to them.

11

The uncertainty estimates of this multiple gap NAIRU is based on an approximate Choleski
decomposition of the variance covariance matrix of the hyper parameters. We had to use the approximation
since two diagonal elements of shock covariance matrix were very close to zero with extremely flat
likelihood. The approximation is based on Schnabel and Eskow (1990) modified Choleski factorization that

5.2 Estimates from the six variable models with no cross correlation
We now reexamine our evidence from single gap six variable model by
comparing it to different variations of two gap models with no cross correlations. To start
out, we compare the six variable single gap model with a model where unemployment
gap is measured separately and exactly as in the bivariate model. The remaining four
variables have a single gap exactly as in the six variable single gap model. We restrict the
correlation between the components of the two blocks to be zero. This allows us to use
Bayes factor to compare the bivariate model to the single gap six variable model. The
estimated Bayes factor of 218 in the top panel of Table 9 is very strong evidence against
the two gap model with no cross correlation when compared with the single gap model of
Table 8. As before, the estimates of the standard deviation of NAIRU shocks and the
NAIRU-unemployment gap correlation exactly match the bivariate estimates.
We follow up by comparing the two single gap four variable models of Section 4
to single gap six variable model by restricting the gaps and the cross correlations. The
middle panel of Table 9 compares with the single gap model of Table 5 where
employment and unemployment gaps were driven by a single common gap. The Bayes
factor of 179 in Table 9, as before, is strong evidence against the two gap model with no
cross correlation. The same is true for the case where unemployment gap and GDP gap
have a common gap. That Bayes factor is 122, once again strong evidence to favor the
single gap model. The estimates of standard deviation of NAIRU shock and the
correlation parameters match the corresponding estimates from four variable models. We

minimizes the elements of diagonal matrix added to the original matrix based on iteratively updated
Gerschgorin bounds. This is only case in the paper where this approximation was used.

21

illustrate the NAIRU estimates from all the above three no cross correlation models in
Figure 9 along with the estimates from bivariate or four variable models.

6. Conclusion
We show in this paper that using multiple indicators to extract a common unobserved
factor helps to reduce the filtering uncertainty and parametric uncertainty around the
extracted point estimates. The crucial assumption is that there is a single measure of
economic slackness that links different variables. We use this method to estimate the
NAIRU and reduce its uncertainty. Specifically, we find that four variables, the GDP
deflator, average wage, real GDP, and civilian employment level are valuable indicators
of the gap in the business cycle. The improvement in precision reduces the confidence
interval by 29 percent. We chose these additional indicators because they did a good job
and are consistent with theory. Use of this method opens the possibility for further
research which might suggest yet more such useful indicators.

A Simple Example of How to Reduce the Filtering Uncertainty of the State
Estimates
Let us consider the following unobserved components model where we observe y1t ,
y 2t and y 3t . Our problem is to get estimates and the filtering uncertainty of the
unobserved components i1t , i2t , i3t and i4t given that we know the parameters of the
model. We assume i jt ~ iidN (0, 1), j = 1, 3, 4 and i 2t ~ iidN (0, σ 2 ) .
y1t = i1t + i2t
y 2 t = i 3t + γ 1 i 2 t
y 3t = i 4 t + γ 2 i 2 t
The common component in the three observed series is the unobserved component i2t
and this makes the estimates of i2t to have lower filtering variance. A special case is
when γ 1 = γ 2 = 0 and the resulting estimates of i2t will be based on only y1t .
We can write the model in the state-space representation as:
Measurement equations:
y t = HI t
⎡1 1
⎡ y1t ⎤
⎢
⎥
y t = y 2t , H = ⎢⎢0 γ 1

In the above transition equations, F is the transition matrix of the state variables and
Q is the variance covariance matrix of the shocks to the state variables (which are

variances of the states themselves in this special case since the states are all white noise).
To start the Kalman filter iteration, we need the steady-state values of I t as I 0|0 and
uncertainty around I t at time zero as P0|0 . We specify those initial values as

⎡0 ⎤
⎢0 ⎥
I 0|0 = ⎢ ⎥,
⎢0 ⎥
⎢ ⎥
⎣0 ⎦
P0|0 = FP0|0 F ′ + Q = Q
Starting the Kalman filter iteration, we have
⎡0 ⎤
⎢0 ⎥
I t|t −1 = FI t −1|t −1 = ⎢ ⎥
⎢0 ⎥
⎢ ⎥
⎣0 ⎦
Pt|t −1 = FPt −1|t −1 F ′ + Q = Q
We denote I t |t −1 as the linear projection of the state variables based on time t − 1
information. The uncertainty (or the variance-covariance matrix) around the projections

45

is denoted as Pt |t −1 , also based on time t − 1. The forecast errors are denoted as η t |t −1 , and
f t |t −1 is the conditional variance of the forecast errors. In the case we are considering

η t|t −1 = yt − HI t|t −1 = y t
f t|t −1

⎡1 + σ 2
⎤

1+ γ1 σ
⎥
⎢ γ 2σ 2 γ 1γ 2σ 2 1 + γ 22σ 2 ⎥
⎣
⎦

Updating the iterations to include time t information, we have the Kalman gain
component, K t :

K t = Pt|t −1 H ′f t|_t −11
Therefore

I t|t = I t|t −1 + K tη t|t −1 = K t y t
Pt|t = Pt|t −1 − K t HPt|t −1 = Q − K t HQ
Since the F matrix is a zero matrix, we have Pt|t = Pt|T , where

It is obvious from the above matrix that for γ 1 = γ 2 = 0 , the variance of
i2t|T

is maximum. So, non-zero values of γ 1 and γ 2 will reduce the variance –
1+σ 2

filtering uncertainty improves with a multiple indicator - common factor approach.
Moreover, the marginal effect of σ 2 is

As evident from the analysis above, the same argument applies to the precision of i1t .
This example highlights, ceteris paribus, the role a common factor approach can play by
extracting information from multiple indicators in improving its precision.
The above model also shows that impact of an additional indicator on improving
filtering uncertainty goes down with increasing number of indicators if everything else is
same. The reduction in filtering uncertainty when we augment the univariate model to a
bivariate system is
trivariate

γ 12σ 4
. Similarly, when we extend the bivariate to a
(1 + σ 2 )(1 + γ 12σ 2 + σ 2 )

system,

the

decline

in

filtering

uncertainty

is

γ 22 σ 4
. To simplify the algebra, let us assume that
(1 + γ 12 σ 2 + σ 2 )(1 + γ 12 σ 2 + γ 22 σ 2 + σ 2 )

γ 1 = γ 2 = γ - thereby making the assumption that y 2t and y 3t individually contain same
amount of information about i2t . Then,
γ 2σ 4
(1 + σ 2 )(1 + γ 2 σ

≥

γ 2σ
(1 + γ 2 σ

+ σ 2 )(1 + 2 γ 2 σ

. So, in the above model, the

biggest reduction in the filtering uncertainty comes from extending the model from the
univariate to the bivariate setup.

The Bivariate Model with Generalized Covariance Matrix of the Shocks

In this section we re-estimated the bivariate model of the Section 3 (eqs. (1) – (4)) with a
generalized variance covariance matrix of the three shocks. Specifically,
⎡ σ C2
⎢
Var − Cov (ε C ,t , ε N ,t , ε gU ,t ) = ⎢ σ CN
⎢σ Cg
⎣ U

⎤
⎥
⎥

σ gU ⎦

is the new variance – covariance matrix of the shocks. This implies estimation of two
more parameters and examining the effects of their standard errors on the total
uncertainty.
In Table A1, we show the estimation results of the new bivariate model with
generalized covariance matrix. The estimate of the standard deviation of the shock to the
NAIRU is 0.22, very similar to what studies like Gordon (1997), Laubach (2001) used
before and what we have in our Table 3. The estimate of the correlation between the
NAIRU and the unemployment gap, ρ NgU , is -0.77 – strongly negative like the MNZ
result. The comparison of the log likelihood values with Table 3 indicates that the
inclusion of the two new parameters were insignificant at the 90 percent level. The
estimate of persistence of the unemployment gap is quite similar to the previous estimate,
0.92.
The surprising element of the generalized covariance matrix is in its effect on the
total uncertainty. The average filtering variance remain almost the same as in Table 3, not
a surprising result given the estimate of the standard deviation of the shock to the NAIRU
is quite similar to what used before. However, the average total variance now has risen to
1.33, primarily due to the big rise in the average parametric variance. In Figure A1, we

48

show the new NAIRU estimates along with the new 95 percent confidence bands. The
NAIRU estimates are similar to our previous estimates but the confidence bands are a lot
wider. This was happening because the log likelihood function is very flat with respect to
the two new covariance parameters, making the Hessian and the variance – covariance
matrix of the estimated parameters very unstable and resulting in a large increase in the
parametric uncertainty.
