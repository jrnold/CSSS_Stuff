Abstract
Relative distribution methods are a nonparametric statistical approach to the comparison
of distributions. These methods combine the graphical tools of exploratory data analysis with
statistical summaries, decomposition, and inference.
This report demonstrates software for implementing relative distribution methods within
the R statistical package. It describes how to download and install the software, and use
it to redo the analysis in the paper “Relative Distribution Methods” by Mark S. Handcock
and Martina Morris, Sociological Methodology, Vol 28, July 1998. The full code, references
and links to further resources are provided.

Introduction

In social science research, differences among groups or changes over time are a common
focus of study. While means and variances are typically the basis for statistical methods
used in this research, the underlying social theory often implies properties of distributions
that are not well captured by these summary measures. Consider some of the current
controversies regarding growing inequality in earnings, racial differences in test scores, socioeconomic correlates of birth outcomes, and the impact of smoking on survival and health.
The distributional differences that animate the debates in these fields are complex. They
comprise the usual mean-shifts and changes in variance, but also more subtle comparisons
of changes in the upper and lower tails of the distributions. Survey and census data on such
attributes contain a wealth of distributional information, but traditional methods of data
analysis leave much of this information untapped.
Handcock and Morris (1998) (HM) present methods for full comparative distributional
analysis. The methods are based on the relative distribution, a non–parametric complete
summary of the information required for scale–invariant comparisons between two distributions. The relative distribution provides a general integrated framework for analysis: a
graphical component that simplifies exploratory data analysis and display, a statistically
valid basis for the development of hypothesis–driven summary measures, and the potential
for decomposition that enables one to examine complex hypotheses regarding the origins of
distributional changes within and between groups. A book length treatment of the methodology is given in Handcock and Morris (1999).
The data used in the report are from two cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey
(NLS), one initiated in 1966 and the other in 1979. These cohorts are referred to as the
original and recent cohorts, respectively. The distributions of wage growth in the two cohorts
are examined. Specifically, the growth profile of “permanent wages” is analyzed to study
the question of wage mobility. A development of the estimation of these permanent wages
and their relevance to the study of wage mobility is given in HM. For the purposes of this
report, we can regard the permanent wages as measurements on two groups that we wish to
compare.
The software described here can be obtained from the Relative Distribution Methods
webpage at http://www.stat.washington.edu/handcock/RelDist. Additional reports of
interest can also be found here. The software is available in a number of forms. Here we will
focus on the version for the statistical program R.
In the following sections we will reconstruct the analyses given in HM without discussing
their substantive interpretation. To fully understand the use of the software it would be useful
to have a copy of HM available for reference. The appropriate function calls and associated
code are given for the methods described by section. In Section 2, directions are provided for
the installation of the R statistical software and the reldist package, which is used to create
graphical representations of relative distributions. In Section 3, the standard approach to
comparing the two distributions is presented. In Section 4, the relative CDF and PDF of
permanent wage growth in the original and recent NLS cohorts are constructed. In Section
5, the relative distribution of permanent wage growth in the two cohorts is decomposed into
the impact of changes in medians and changes in shape. In Section 6, summary statistics for
the location/shape decomposition of the relative distribution of wage gains are computed. In
1

Section 7, an example of covariate adjustment is provided, adjusting the relative distribution
of permanent wage growth for changes in educational composition between the two cohorts.
And finally in Section 8, the code necessary for reproducing a discrete level contrast example
and an additive decomposition example is given.

2.1

Installing the software
Installing R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is often referred to
“GNU S” as it was inspired by the well-known and powerful software that has also inspired
“S-Plus”. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s
GNU General Public License in source code form. It can be easily installed over the web on a
wide variety of LINUX and UNIX platforms It also runs on Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP and
MacOS. Official information about the R Project can be found at http://www.r-project.org.
To download the most recent version of the software, go to http://cran.r-project.org. Alternatively, follow the “CRAN” link from the R Project website to find a list of URL’s that
comprise the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). All of the CRAN servers maintain current versions of code and documentation for the R statistical package. From the
CRAN, the R source code can be downloaded, or precompiled binary distributions can be
downloaded for particular platforms. For platform specific installation instructions, follow
the appropriate links.

2.2

Installing the R package reldist

To install the reldist package, simply open R and type
install.packages("reldist",contriburl="http://www.csde.washington.edu/~handcock")
at the prompt. Once the package has been downloaded and installed, it can be used by
typing the call
library(reldist).
For instructions on usage, read the man page by typing
help(package="reldist").
Finally, to access the data that was used to create the figures in this paper, type
library(reldist)
data(nls).
Using the nls data with the code provided below, it is possible to recreate the figures at the
end of this paper. This should be an optimal way to check the installation of the reldist
package.
The data set contains two data.frames, one for the “original” and one for “recent” cohort
(called original and recent, respectively). Each data.frame has three columns: the change
2

in permanent wages (in log-dollars), the final achieved educational level (in years), and the
sample weight. The columns names are chpermwage, endeduc, and wgt, respectively.
The commands listed in this report are also available for download from the Relative
Distribution Methods website.

Density Estimation

The standard approach to comparing the original and recent NLS cohort distributions involves looking at the summary statistics and plotting the probability density functions
(PDFs) and Lorenz curves. The built in R function used for estimating the PDFs is density.
Because our data has weights we create a (weighted) sample from it for the purposes of
creating these graphs. The commands are:
schpermwage1<-sample(original$chpermwage,size=1000,
prob=original$wgt/sum(original$wgt),replace=TRUE)
schpermwage2<-sample(recent$chpermwage,size=1000,
prob=recent$wgt/sum(recent$wgt),replace=TRUE)
The plots of the PDFs given in Figure 1 (a) are generated by
kwidth <- 0.2597
dens1 <- density(schpermwage1, n = 500, width=kwidth)
plot(x = (dens1$x), y = dens1$y, type = "l",
xlab = "change in log permanent wage", ylab = "density",
axes = FALSE,
xlim = c(-1, 3),
ylim=c(0,1.2))
title(main="(a)",cex=0.6)
axis(side = 1)
axis(side = 2)
fig1legend <- list(x=c(1.2,1.2),y=c(1.2,1.2))
legend(fig1legend,lty=1:2,cex=0.5, bty="n",
legend=c("original cohort","recent cohort"))
dens2 <- density(schpermwage2, n = 500, width=kwidth)
lines(x = (dens2$x), y = dens2$y, type = "l",lty=2)
From the plot of the PDFs, we see that the recent cohort experienced smaller average wage
gains, these gains were more variable, and the frequency of low wage gains was much greater
for the recent cohort.
Lorenz curves are a standard method used for inequality comparison. The plots of the
Lorenz curves given in Figure 1 (b) are generated by
swage1 <- sort(recent$chpermwage)
swage2 <- sort(original$chpermwage)
xout <- (0:1000)/1000
alpha <- seq(along=swage2)/length(swage2)
3

galpha <- cumsum(swage2)/sum(swage2)
fn1 <- approx(x=alpha,y=galpha,xout=xout)
plot(x = alpha, y = galpha, type = "l",
xlab = "proportion of population",
ylab = "proportion of wages",
ylim=c(0,1.0))
legend(x=c(0,0),y=c(1.03,1.03),lty=1:2,cex=0.5, bty="n",
legend=c("original cohort","recent cohort"))
Here we see that the Lorenz curve for the recent cohort lies uniformly below that of the
original cohort which indicates that there is more inequality in the distribution of recent
wage gains.

The Relative Distribution

To do a full distributional comparison based on the relative distribution, we look at the
PDF and CDF of the relative distribution. Both preserve all of the information necessary
to compare the two distributions. If the two distributions are identical, then the CDF of
the relative distribution is a 45◦ line and the PDF of the relative distribution is that of the
uniform on [0, 1].
To obtain the relative CDF in Figure 2 (a) we use
fig2a <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage,yo=original$chpermwage,
ci=FALSE,smooth=0.4,
yowgt=original$wgt,ywgt=recent$wgt,
cdfplot=TRUE,
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
ylabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
cex=0.8,
ylab="proportion of the recent cohort",
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main="(a)",cex=0.6)
The option cdfplot = TRUE is used to obtain a plot of the CDF rather than the (default)
density. The options yowgt and ywgt are used to assign a vector of weights to the reference
distribution and comparison distribution, respectively. The smooth option identifies the
degree of smoothness required in the fit. Specifying higher values of smooth leads to smoother
curves, while specifying lower values leads to closer fits to the observed data. The relative
PDF in Figure 2 (b) is produced with
fig2b <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage,yo=original$chpermwage,
ci=FALSE,smooth=0.4,
yowgt=original$wgt,ywgt=recent$wgt,bar=TRUE,
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
ylim=c(0,2.5),cex=0.8,
ylab="Relative Density",
4

xlab="Proportion of the Original Cohort")
title(main="(b)",cex=0.6)
Here the option bar=TRUE is used to superimpose a barplot on the relative density estimate.
Figures 3 (a) and (b) show the effects of increasing the smooth option used in Figures 2 (a)
and (b) by specifying smooth = 1.2.

Decomposing the Relative Distribution

In this section we decompose the overall relative distribution into two component relative
distributions which depict differences in location and shape. Figure 4 displays the median
and shape decomposition of the relative distribution of weight gains and is generated by
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
g10 <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage, yo=original$chpermwage,
smooth=0.4, ci=FALSE,
ywgt=recent$wgt, yowgt=original$wgt,
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
ylim=c(0.5,3.0),
bar=TRUE, quiet=FALSE,
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main=paste("(a) entropy = ",format(g10$entropy,digits=3)),cex=0.6)
abline(h=1,lty=2)
g1A <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage, yo=original$chpermwage,
ywgt=recent$wgt, yowgt=original$wgt,
show="effect",
bar=TRUE, quiet=FALSE,
ylim=c(0.5,3.0), ylab="",
smooth=0.4, ci=FALSE,
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main=paste("(b) entropy = ",format(entropy(g1A,g10),digits=3)),cex=0.6)
abline(h=1,lty=2)
gA0 <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage, yo=original$chpermwage,
smooth=0.4, ci=FALSE,
ywgt=recent$wgt, yowgt=original$wgt,
show="residual",
bar=TRUE, quiet=FALSE,
ylim=c(0.5,3.0), ylab="",
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main=paste("(c) entropy = ",format(gA0$entropy,digits=3)),cex=0.6)
abline(h=1,lty=2)
Panel (a) shows the overall relative density (and is the same as Figure 2 (b)). Panel (b) represents the effect of the median shift in the wage gains between the two cohorts – displaying
5

what the relative density would have looked like if there had been no change in distributional shape. The option show="effect" is used to additively shift the reference sample
median to the comparison sample median before comparing the two distributions. Panel (c)
displays the effect of changes in distributional shape. The option show="residual" is used
to additively scale the reference sample to the comparison sample before comparing the two
distributions.

Summary Measures

To complement the graphical displays of the preceding sections, we compute summary measures based on the relative distribution which can be used for the comparison of distributional
change. In particular, we calculate entropy, which is a widely used measure of the dispersion
of the distribution, and the median relative polarization index, which provides a means to
measure distributional polarization. Both summary measures have useful decompositions.
The overall entropy may be decomposed into a median effect and a shape effect. The median
relative polarization index may be decomposed into upper and lower polarization indices,
representing the contributions made by components above and below the median of the relative distribution, respectively. In Table 1 the full set of summary statistics is presented.
Note also that entropy summaries are given on the top of Figure 4.
The summary statistics may be reproduced with
format(rpy(y=recent$chpermwage,yo=original$chpermwage,
ywgt=recent$wgt,yowgt=original$wgt,pvalue=TRUE),
digits=3)
format(rpluy(y=recent$chpermwage,yo=original$chpermwage,
ywgt=recent$wgt,yowgt=original$wgt,pvalue=TRUE),
digits=3)
format(rpluy(y=recent$chpermwage,yo=original$chpermwage,
ywgt=recent$wgt,yowgt=original$wgt,pvalue=TRUE,
upper=TRUE),
digits=3)

The Relative Distribution for Discrete Variables

The educational composition of the NLS cohorts may be different and this will likely effect
the wage outcomes. We will consider the effect in the next section, but here consider the
distributional difference between the two cohorts.
Figure 5 shows the relative distribution of final observed education in the two cohorts
and is generated by

Covariate Adjustment

One can separate the impacts of changes in population composition from changes in the
covariate-outcome relationship by adjusting the relative distribution for changes in the distribution of other covariates. This method decomposes the relative distribution into the
composition effect or the component that represents the effect of changes in the marginal
distribution of the covariate, and a component that represents residual changes.
Based on Figure 5, the educational composition of the NLS cohorts has changed. The covariate adjustment technique can be used to determine whether differences in the educational
profile between the two cohorts explain some of the changes in relative wage gains.
Figure 6 is a graphical representation of the adjustment of the relative distribution for
education composition changes and is produced with
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
i3x <- sample(seq(along=original$chpermwage),
size = 10*length(original$chpermwage),
prob=rdsamp(e2,e1,recent$wgt,original$wgt),
replace = TRUE)

schpermwage1 <- original$chpermwage[i3x]
wschpermwage1 <- original$wgt[i3x]
g10 <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage, yo=original$chpermwage,
smooth=0.4, ci=FALSE,
ywgt=recent$wgt, yowgt=original$wgt,
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
ylim=c(0.5,3.0),
bar=TRUE, quiet=FALSE,
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main=paste("(a) entropy = ",format(g10$entropy,digits=3)),cex=0.6)
abline(h=1,lty=2)
g1A <- reldist(y=schpermwage1, yo=original$chpermwage,
yowgt=original$wgt, ywgt=wschpermwage1,
bar=TRUE, quiet=FALSE,
ylim=c(0.5,3.0), ylab="",
smooth=0.4, ci=FALSE,
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main=paste("(b) entropy = ",format(entropy(g1A,g10),digits=3)),cex=0.6)
abline(h=1,lty=2)
gA0 <- reldist(y=recent$chpermwage, yo=schpermwage1,
smooth=0.4, ci=FALSE,
ywgt=recent$wgt, yowgt=wschpermwage1,
bar=TRUE, quiet=FALSE,
ylim=c(0.5,3.0), ylab="",
yolabs=seq(-1,3,by=0.5),
xlab="proportion of the original cohort")
title(main=paste("(c) entropy = ",format(gA0$entropy,digits=3)),cex=0.6)
abline(h=1,lty=2)
Panel (a) is the (unadjusted) relative density of wage gains (same as Figure 2b), panel (b)
represents the education composition effects, and panel (c) represents the education-adjusted
relative density of wage gains. Thus panel (c) represents the expected relative density of
wage gains had the education profiles of the two cohorts been identical.

Additional Topics

For a discrete covariate, we may adjust for this covariate as in Section 8, or we may compare
the groups defined by the covariate directly. To demonstrate this technique, education is
again used as a covariate, but now it is defined in discrete form. In particular education is
divided into the categories of those with a high school degree or less and those with one or
more years of college.
First we show the code for creating the variables:
# el1 is the final education for the Original

# cohort (with nobs > 2 and non-attrited)
# 1= < HS 2= HS 3=HS+ 4= College+
#
# First generate the samples

el1[el1 < 12] <- 1
el1[el1 == 12] <- 2
el1[el1 > 12 & el1 < 16] <- 3
el1[el1 >= 16] <- 4
#
el2 <- e2
el2[el2 < 12] <- 1
el2[el2 == 12] <- 2
el2[el2 > 12 & el2 < 16] <- 3
el2[el2 >= 16] <- 4
#
i3x <- sample(seq(along=original$chpermwage),
size = 10*length(original$chpermwage),
prob=rdsamp(el2,el1,recent$wgt,original$wgt),
replace = TRUE)
schpermwage1 <- original$chpermwage[i3x]
wschpermwage1 <- original$wgt[i3x]
sel1 <- el1[i3x]
#
pwhso <- schpermwage1[sel1 <= 2 & !is.na(sel1)]
pwsco <- schpermwage1[sel1 > 2 & !is.na(sel1)]
wgthso <- wschpermwage1[sel1 <= 2 & !is.na(sel1)]
wgtsco <- wschpermwage1[sel1 > 2 & !is.na(sel1)]
#
pwhsr <- recent$chpermwage[el2 <= 2 & !is.na(el2)]
pwscr <- recent$chpermwage[el2 > 2 & !is.na(el2)]
wgthsr <- recent$wgt[el2 <= 2 & !is.na(el2)]
wgtscr <- recent$wgt[el2 > 2 & !is.na(el2)]
Figure 7 compares the distributions of wage gains for the two education groups, as density
overlays (a and c) and as relative densities, recent to original cohort (b and d). Panels (a)
and (b) compare the wage gains for the high school educated across the two cohorts. Panels
(c) and (d) compare the wage gains for the the college educated across the two cohorts.

To assess how much the location and shape shifts in each groups’ distribution contributes to
the overall change in their relative positions, we make a decomposition into the “marginal
effects” of each change. It is also possible to obtain a unique decomposition by defining the
effects sequentially. Figure 8 presents the two compositions side by side and is produced

Panel (a) represents the marginal effects of the median shift from the original density, the
marginal effect of the shape change in the high school distribution, and the marginal effect
of the shape change in the college distribution. Panel (b) represents the sequential effects
of the relative median shift from the original relative distribution, then the shape change in
the college distribution form the median shifted original relative distribution, and finally the
shape change in the high school distribution from the median shifted, college shape changed
relative distribution.
