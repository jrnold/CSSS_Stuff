Abstract
We describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific projections of the total
fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. It decomposes the evolution of TFR in three phases:
pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The
model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division’s current
deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below
replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that
depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is
used to project future TFR based on both the country’s TFR history and the pattern of all
countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using
a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled
using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and
oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections
for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated.

Population forecasts predict the future size and composition of populations, based on
projections of fertility, mortality and migration. They are used for many purposes, including
predicting the demand for food, water, education, medical services, labor markets, pension
systems, and future impact on the environment. It is important for decision makers to not
only have a point forecast that states the most likely scenario for a future population, but
also to know the uncertainty around it, that is, the possible future values of an outcome,
and how likely each set of possible future values is.
Fertility is a key driver of the size and composition of the population. Fertility decline
has been a primary determinant of population aging and projected levels of fertility have
important implications on the age structure of future populations, including the pace of
population aging. The total fertility rate (TFR) is one of the key components in population
projections; it is the average number of children a woman would bear if she survived through
the end of the reproductive age span, experiencing at each age the age-specific fertility rates
of that period.
In this paper we propose a new methodology for probabilistic projections of the total
fertility rate for all the countries of the world. The goal is to produce probabilistic projections
that would ultimately be part of the population projections produced by the United Nations
Population Division. Earlier versions of this methodology were described by Alkema (2008),
Alkema et al. (2008, 2009), and Raftery et al. (2009).
Until now, most operational population projections have been deterministic, produced
using the standard cohort-component population projection model. Future fertility rates
have typically been assigned in a deterministic way. The main organizations that have
produced population projections for all or most of the world’s countries are the United
Nations, the World Bank (Bos et al. 1994) and the United States Bureau of the Census (U.
S. Census Bureau 2009), all of which use the standard deterministic approach.
Probabilistic projections of the TFR have been proposed, mostly for developed countries with low fertility. Lee (1993) and Lee and Tuljapurkar (1994) proposed a time series
approach based on the probabilistic mortality projection method of Lee and Carter (1992),
for decomposing and projecting fertility in the U.S. Methods based on expert judgement
have been developed and applied by Lutz, Sanderson, and Scherbov (2001). The Uncertain
Population in Europe project (Alho et al. 2006; Alders, Keilman, and Cruijsen 2007; Alho,
Jensen, and Lassila 2008) developed probabilistic TFR projections for 18 European countries
using the ex-post method based on the errors of previous projections (Keyfitz 1981; Stoto
1983). Hyndman and Booth (2008) developed a method using functional data models and
applied it to Australia, as well as France (Booth et al. 2009).
These methods were developed mainly for low fertility countries that have largely finished

1

going through the fertility transition and for which fertility is fluctuating in a fairly stable,
stationary way. They do not apply easily to countries that are still going through the fertility
transition. Here we develop a methodology for all countries.
A great deal of the demographic literature over the past sixty years has been concerned
with explaining trends in fertility; see the reviews by Hirschman (1994) and Mason (1997).
This literature is dominated by controversy over why fertility has declined in most countries.
Proposed explanations include socioeconomic and educational development, declines in child
mortality, contraceptive programs and ideational changes; see Raftery, Lewis, and Aghajanian (1995) for one empirical comparison between competing theories. In spite of this, there
has been a general consensus that, whatever the causes, the evolution of fertility includes
three broad phases: a high-fertility pre-transition phase, the fertility transition itself and a
low-fertility post-transition phase during which fertility remains close to replacement level.
Our methodology is based on this sequence of change. For countries that are going
through the fertility transition from high fertility toward replacement fertility, we decompose the pace of the fertility decline into a systematic decline and random distortion terms.
The pace of the systematic decline in TFR is modeled as a function of its level, based on the
current UN methodology. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the parameters of the decline function. A time series model is used for projecting trends in fertility after
reaching replacement level, assuming that in the long term the TFR will fluctuate around
replacement-level fertility. The results are country-specific projections that are reproducible
and take into account past trends.
We build on the deterministic methodology currently used by the United Nations Population Division for projecting the TFR. The UN Population Division produces projections
of the total fertility rate for 196 countries that are revised every two years and published
in the World Population Prospects (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social
Aﬀairs, Population Division 2009). The UN produces deterministic TFR projections. It
then decomposes them into projected age-specific fertility rates using fertility schedules, and
finally combines them with projections of mortality and international migration using the
cohort-component projection method, to yield the Medium variant of the oﬃcial United
Nations population projections.
The eﬀect of lower or higher fertility is illustrated with the Low and High variants of
the projections. In the high variant, half a child is added to the TFR projections in order
to examine the influence of higher fertility on the population projections. Similarly, for
the low variant, half a child is subtracted from the TFR projections. The high and low
variants highlight the sensitivity of demographic outcomes to diﬀerent assumptions about
future TFR, but they do not assess the uncertainty in future fertility levels (Bongaarts and

2

Bulatao 2000), nor to what extent the low or high fertility variants are more likely.
Our projection intervals vary by country. The 80% projection intervals are wider than
the current UN low-high intervals in most high-fertility countries, and narrower in most
low-fertility countries. On average, the 80% projection intervals are slightly narrower than
the UN high-low intervals. For high-fertility countries, the pace of fertility decline in our
projections is slower compared to corresponding UN projections, but about the same for
most other countries.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the Bayesian projection
model. The following section summarizes the results and the out-of-sample projection validation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the methodology and results, and additional
details of the model are given in the Appendix.

BAYESIAN PROJECTION MODEL
The three phases
We base our projections on the five-year UN estimates of TFR for 1950 to 2010 from the 2008
revision of the UN World Population Prospects (United Nations, Department of Economic
and Social Aﬀairs, Population Division 2009). The outcome in each five-year period (t, t + 5)
is computed between July 1st of year t and July 1st of year t+5, and centered on January 1st
in year t + 3. Following standard fertility transition theory, the change in TFR is modeled in
three phases, illustrated in Figure 1. Phase I is the stable pre-transition high fertility phase;
the fertility transition has not started yet and fertility fluctuates around high TFR levels.
In some countries there was an increase before the decline started. Phase II is the fertility
transition from high fertility to replacement-level fertility or below, and Phase III consists
of the post-transition low fertility, which includes recovery from below-replacement fertility
toward replacement fertility and oscillations around replacement-level fertility.
We do not model Phase I explicitly because in all countries, the TFR has now started
to decline, so Phase I is not relevant for projections. Instead we use a deterministic rule to
identify the periods during which a country was in Phase I. If the TFR was below 5.5 in
1950–1955, we define Phase I for that country as having ended before 1950–1955, i.e. before
the beginning of our data set. For the other countries, we define the start period of the
fertility decline as the most recent period with a local maximum that is within 0.5 children
of the global maximum of the TFR within that country. The use of half child is a more
stringent threshold than the 5% decline proposed by other authors to detect the early stage
of the fertility transition (Bongaarts 2002b; Casterline 2001).
Phase III starts after the fertility transition has been completed. To operationalize this

for countries where this happened during the observation period, we say that Phase III
started the first time two 5-year increases below a TFR of 2 were observed. More specifically, the start of Phase III is the earliest period t for which: (i) fc,t > fc,t−1 , (ii) fc,t+1 > fc,t ,
and (iii) fc,p < 2 for p = t − 1, t, t + 1. Thus the start of Phase III is in the middle of two

increments below a TFR of 2 children. By this definition, in 2005–2010 the start of phase
III has been observed in 20 countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Channel Islands, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
Norway, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States).

Fertility transition model
When a country is in Phase II, the five-year decline in its TFR is modeled as a sum of
two logistic functions and a random distortion term. Specifically, fc,t , the TFR in five-year
period t in country c, is modeled by a random walk model with drift:
fc,t+1 = fc,t − dc,t + εc,t , for τc ≤ t < λc ,

(1)

where dc,t is the decrement term that models the systematic decline during the fertility
transition, εc,t are random distortions that model the deviations from the systematic decline,
τc is the start period of the fertility decline, and λc is the start period of the post-transition
phase. The decrement dc,t is modeled as a function of the level of the TFR, as follows:
�
g(θ c , fc,t ) for τc ≤ t < λc and fc,t ≥ 1;
dct = d(θ c , λc , τc , fc,t ) =
(2)
0
otherwise,
4

where g(·, ·) is a parametric decline function. This function specifies a five-year decrement
(decrease) as a function of the current level of the TFR and parameter vector θ.

The decline function is the sum of two logistic functions, i.e. a double logistic or bilogistic function (Meyer 1994). The first logistic function describes a pace of fast decline at
high total fertility rates that decreases toward a slower pace as fertility becomes lower. The
second function describes the opposite force, namely a slowing down of the pace of fertility
decline over time. The sum of the two is a parametric function that describes a decline in
fertility that starts with a slow pace at high TFR values, peaks and slows down again at
lower TFR values, the general shape of the trend in TFR observed in many countries. This
model underlies the current deterministic UN methodology (United Nations, Department of
Economic and Social Aﬀairs, Population Division 2006), and it is flexible enough to represent
a wide range of fertility decline patterns.

Figure 2 illustrates the parametrization of the double logistic function. The five-year decrements as given by the decline function are plotted against TFR. The TFR is reversed, i.e.
plotted from high to low outcomes on the horizontal axis so that the five-year decrements
during the fertility transition are given by the decline curve in chronological order when following the curve from left to right. The maximum possible pace of the decline (the maximum
five-year decrement) is dc . However, the actual maximum pace tends to be slightly smaller
than dc ; it depends on the four �ci ’s, which describe the TFR ranges in which the pace of
the fertility decline changes.

�
The decline starts at TFR level Uc = 4i=1 �i , where the decrement is between 0 and
10% of its maximum pace. Between TFR levels Uc and Uc − �c1 , the pace of the decline
increases from around 0.1dc to over 0.8dc . During the TFR range denoted by �c2 , the TFR

declines at a higher pace than during the rest of the transition: its five-year decrements
range between 0.8dc and dc . In �c3 the pace of the fertility decline decreases further to 0.1dc
at TFR level �c4 . The decline is set to zero if the TFR is smaller than one.

The parameters of the decline function are estimated for each country. For countries
�
in which the transition started before period 1950–1955, the start level Uc =
�ci of the

fertility decline is added as a parameter to the model. For countries in which the fertility
decline started after 1950–1955, the start period τc is within the observation period. For these
countries, the start level Uc is fixed at the TFR in that period, Uc = fc,τc . The systematic
decline in the start period is between 0 and 10% of the maximum decline, with a “start

period:
εc,τc ∼ N (mτ , s2τ ),

(3)

where mτ is the mean and sτ is the standard deviation of the distortion in the start period.
The distribution of the distortion term εc,t after start period τc is
εc,t ∼ N (0, σ(fc,t )2 ), for t �= τc .

(4)

The expression for its standard deviation σ(fc,t ) is based on examination of the absolute
distortions as a function of the TFR level (which shows a higher variance around a TFR of
4-5, and over time), and is given in the Appendix.
Given Uc , the five parameters that determine the pace of the fertility decline and the
time that the transition takes in country c are �c4 , {�ci /(Uc − �c4 ) : i = 1, 2, 3}, and dc .
Estimating these five parameters presents a challenge, because for any one country there
are at most 11 observed five-year decrements in Phase II, often fewer. We use a Bayesian
hierarchical model (Lindley and Smith 1972; Gelman et al. 2004) which allows us to borrow
strength from the observations in all countries when estimating the parameters for country
c, and also to assess the uncertainty of the estimates.
The model assumes that for all countries, each of their unknown decline parameters is
drawn from a probability distribution that represents the range of outcomes of that decline
6

parameter across all countries. For a specific country, the posterior distribution of its decline
parameters is then determined by the world-level experience for all countries combined, as
well as the observed declines in that country. The resulting estimate can be viewed as based
on a weighted average of a “world pattern” and information from the country data. In
the hierarchical model, transformations of parameters are used to restrict their outcomes to
realistic values.
The maximum five-year decrement,
�
� dc , is transformed to restrict its outcomes to between
c −0.25
0.25 and 2.5 child: d∗c = log d2.5−d
. The upper bound of 2.5 reflects the maximum pace
c
of fertility decline observed in the past, i.e. around 2 children per five-year period in China.

The hierarchical distribution of the transformed dc ’s is given by d∗c ∼ N (χ, ψ 2 ), where χ is

the world mean of the d∗c ’s, and ψ 2 is their variance.
A similar approach yields world distributions of the other decline parameters. The world

distribution for ��c4 is given
� by �c4 ∼ N (�4 , δ4 ), where �c4 is a logit-transform of �c4 ,
�c4 −1
namely �∗c4 = log 2.5−�
, to restrict it to be between 1 and 2.5 children.

To define the world distributions of {�ci /(Uc − �c4 ) : i = 1, 2, 3}, we first define
�3

for i = 1, 2, 3, such that

i=1 pci = 1. For the purpose of computation,

new parameters γci , i = 1, 2, 3 are introduced, with the pci ’s defined as a function of these
parameters (Gelman et al. 1996): pci =

The hierarchical model for the γci ’s is

where αi is the hierarchical mean of the γci ’s and δi2 is their variance.

To summarize, the complete Phase II model is defined by the random walk with drift as
described in Eq.(1), the distributions of the random distortion terms given by Eq.(3) and
(4), hierarchical distributions for country-specific decline parameters, prior distributions on
the variance parameters of the distortion terms and hierarchical parameters, and a prior
distribution on Uc for the countries in which the transition started before 1950–1955. A
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to get samples of the posterior
distributions of each of the parameters of the fertility transition model (Gelfand and Smith
1990). The full model and details of the MCMC algorithm are given in the Appendix.

Estimated decline curves
Figure 3 shows the observed five-year decrements during the fertility transition, against
decreasing TFR, for all countries combined. The world mean of the double logistic decline
curve is plotted in red.
For comparison, we also show the double logistic curves currently used by the UN. The
UN currently uses three specific double logistic curves, each corresponding to one set of
double logistic parameters. Each of these is chosen to describe a diﬀerent observed pace of
decline; they are called “slow-slow,” “fast-slow” and “fast-fast.” For each country, the UN
7

analyst chooses the decline curve that seems most reasonable for the future fertility decline
in that country, based on what has been observed to date in that country or its region. The
TFR is kept constant after it decreases to 1.85. Our method generalizes the current UN
approach because we allow a wide range of parameter values for the double logistic curve
rather than restricting it to a small number of possibilities.
The UN decline functions corresponding to the fast/fast and slow/slow declines are shown
in blue in Figure 3. The Bayesian world decline curve diﬀers from the UN decline curves at
high TFR values, but the maximum decrements are comparable between the Bayesian and
UN curves. The Bayesian world decline curve increases rapidly to its maximum outcome
after the start of the decline, while the UN decline curves increase more slowly as TFR
declines and peak around a TFR of 5.
Figure 4 shows the Bayesian estimates of the double logistic decline curves for Thailand,
India and Mozambique, together with the observed decrements in those countries and the
fast/fast and slow/slow UN decline curves. The shapes of the curves for Thailand and India
are very diﬀerent. Thailand has had a very fast fertility transition, and its median decline
curve peaked at a five-year decrement of around one child per five-year period. In India the
transition has been much slower, with a maximum decrement of around 0.4 children every
five years. The UN decline curves do not capture the extent of the variation between these
two countries. In Mozambique, the observed and projected decrements are smaller than the
decrements as given by the UN decline curves. Only a short part of its transition has been
observed so far, which leads to large uncertainty about the pace of its future transition.
The 95% projection interval includes decline curves with a maximum decrement that ranges
between about 0.3 and 0.8 children per five-year period.

Post-transition model
In long-term projections the TFR is assumed to converge toward and fluctuate around
replacement-level fertility (around 2.1 children per woman for low-mortality countries). As
proposed by Lee and Tuljapurkar (1994), this is modeled with a first order autoregressive
time series model, an AR(1) model, with its mean fixed at the approximate replacement-level
fertility, µ = 2.1:
fc,t ∼ N (µ + ρ(fc,t−1 − µ), s2 ) for t > λc ,

(5)

where ρ is the autoregressive parameter with |ρ| < 1 and s is the standard deviation of the

random errors. This can also be written as fc,t = fc,t−1 + (1 − ρ)(µ − fc,t−1 ) + ec,t , with
errors ec,t ∼ N (0, s2 ). In this model the expected increase or decrease toward 2.1 is larger
if the current TFR is farther from 2.1, and depends on ρ. For example, at a TFR of 1.5,

the expected next TFR is 2.1 − 0.6ρ; a smaller ρ will give a larger expected increase. The

where zα is the (1 − α2 ) quantile of the standard normal distribution. For example, for an

(6) is the projection interval for the TFR in the distant future.
The AR(1) parameters ρ and s are estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation based
on all the data points after and including period λc . The start of Phase III has been observed
in 20 countries, giving 52 post-transition outcomes (fc,t−1 , fc,t ) to estimate the parameters
of the AR(1) process. The maximum-likelihood estimate for ρ is 0.906, and the estimated
standard deviation of the residuals is 0.09. The 52 post-transition outcomes and fitted
regression line are shown in Figure 5; the fitted regression line fits the data well. The
asymptotic 80% projection interval is [1.83, 2.37] and the asymptotic 95% projection interval
is [1.68, 2.52].
The estimated value of ρ gives expected increases that are similar to those from the
current UN methodology. The UN projects increments of 0.05 child for each five-year period,
until the TFR equals 1.85, as shown in blue in the same figure.

TFR projections
TFR projections during the fertility transition are based on the Phase II model, using the
sample from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The result is a sample from
the predictive distribution of future TFR trajectories for each country. For example, consider
projecting fc,t+1 , the TFR in country c in period (t + 1), assuming that it is in Phase II. The
(i)
predictive distribution is represented by a sample {fc,t+1 : i = 1, . . . , I}. The i-th member
(i)

(i)

(i)

(i)

(i)

(i)
of the sample, fc,t+1 , is then given by fc,t+1 = fc,t − d(θ (i)
c , fc,t ) + εc,t , where θ c is the i-th
(i)

sample of parameter vector θ c , and εc,t is a random draw from N (0, σ(fc,t )(i) ).

In each trajectory, Phase III is projected to start when the TFR has decreased to a TFR
level which is around replacement-level fertility, and after the pace of the fertility decline has
decreased to zero. These assumptions are incorporated into the definition of the projected
(i)

(i)

start of Phase III, which is given by the earliest period t such that (i) mint {fc,t } ≤ �c4 , and
(i)

(i)

(i)

(ii) fc,t > fc,t−1 . The TFR level �c4 is the TFR outcome at which the pace of the fertility

declines has decreased to 10% of the maximum five-year decrement, and is restricted to be
between 1 and 2.5 children, to ensure that the fertility transition ends around replacementlevel fertility. The TFR increases in period t when the sum of the expected fertility decrement
(given by the decline parameters) and the random distortion term is positive. The chance of
an increasing TFR in period t increases as the expected fertility decrements decrease, and is
thus more likely to occur at the end of the fertility transition. This definition of the start of
Phase III means that the projected start period depends on the decline parameters, as well
as the random distortion terms. The start of Phase III will vary between trajectories, which
quantifies the uncertainty in the start of the recovery phase. For projections during Phase
III, the AR(1) model is used, with the parameters as described in the previous section.
In all projections, an additional prior distribution is put on future TFR outcomes, fc,t+1 ∼

U [0, Uc ]. The upper bound is used to exclude TFR trajectories in which the fertility transition
does not take oﬀ. The lower bound ensures positive TFR outcomes. This prior is enforced
by resampling any future distortion term that results in TFR outcomes outside its prior
bounds.
After constructing a large sample of TFR trajectories, the “best” TFR projection is given
by the median outcome of the TFR trajectories in each period, and the bounds of the 80%
projection intervals are given by the 10th and 90th percentiles.

RESULTS
Probabilistic TFR projections
We now illustrate the results of the Bayesian projection model (BPM) for several countries.
The results for all countries are given in the Appendix. Figure 6 shows the projection intervals
for future TFR in six countries with diﬀerent fertility pasts and prospects, namely Italy,
China, the USA, India, Israel and Mozambique. We also show the current UN projections
and the result of adding and subtracting half a child to and from the median BPM projection,
by analogy with how the UN constructs its high and low variants. The most recent UN
estimates for 2005–2010 and projections for 2045–2050 and 2095–2100 for these countries
are shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Projection results for 2045–2050 and 2095–2100 for selected countries, ordered by
increasing TFR in 2005–2010. “Low” and “High” refer to the lower and upper bounds of
the 80% projection interval.

Italy: Italy is one of the countries, mostly in Europe, that have had “lowest-low” fertility
during the past two decades, as documented by Kohler, Billari, and Ortega (2002), Billari and
Kohler (2004) and Frejka and Sobotka (2008). Various possible explanations of this have
been reviewed by Morgan and Taylor (2006). After some recovery over the past decade,
Italy’s TFR is currently 1.38. Our method projects a slow recovery, with relatively tight
80% projection intervals of about plus or minus a quarter of a child, much tighter in this
case than the UN’s scenarios of plus or minus half a child. The UN projects a recovery of
TFR toward 1.85 while our method projects movement toward 2.1. However, the average
recovery projected by our model is so slow that the UN medium projection and the Bayesian
median projection are essentially the same for 2045–50 (1.77 and 1.76). Even by 2100 the
Bayesian median projection is still below 2.1 (1.97), although there is a real possibility of
recovery by then (the upper bound is 2.26).

Our projection of a recovery is supported by the more detailed analysis by region, age
and social group conducted by Caltabiano, Castiglioni, and Rossina (2009). One possible
explanation is given by Myrskyla, Kohler, and Billari (2009), who postulate a recent reversal
of the negative relationship between fertility and socioeconomic factors that prevailed during
the fertility transition.
This paper is concerned with projecting period TFR, which UN incorporates into its
population projections. Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) have pointed out that current belowreplacement period TFRs may be lower than the cohort TFRs for the currently fertile cohorts,
reflecting a tempo rather than a quantum eﬀect. Our AR(1) model for the low fertility Phase
III predicts a recovery from below-replacement period TFR, as does the Bongaarts-Feeney
work, and so it may to some extent capture this phenomenon. Bongaarts (2002a), Lutz,
O’Neill, and Scherbov (2003) and Sobotka (2005) have estimated the average tempo eﬀect
on TFR in Europe to be in the range of 0.2–0.3 children, and as a result Lutz et al. (2003)
predicted that average TFR in Europe would increase from about 1.5 to about 1.8. This is
compatible with our projections.
The probabilistic TFR projections of the Uncertain Population in Europe project (Alho
et al. 2006; Alders, Keilman, and Cruijsen 2007; Alho, Jensen, and Lassila 2008) yield
much wider intervals than our method for the below replacement European countries, with
widths of their 80% intervals averaging around 1.7 compared with our 0.6 or so. They based
their intervals on past projection errors by projecting agencies, and these tended to greatly
underestimate the pace of decline, leading to large errors. Our projection method would
have made much smaller errors in the past, leading to tighter projection intervals for the
future.
China: According to the UN estimates, Chinese TFR fell precipitously from the 1960s to
the late 1990s, but has remained constant for the past 15 years or so, at its current level of
1.77. The Bayesian median projection is that the fertility transition is not yet finished, and
that a further small decline will be followed by a slow recovery. The UN projection is quite
diﬀerent, remaining essentially constant at 1.85.
Our projection intervals for China are much wider than for Italy — one child compared
to half a child — even though both countries are currently below replacement. This reflects
the unusual form of the Chinese data, with a steep fall followed by the abrupt end of the
decline.
In fact there is controversy about whether the sudden halt to the decline over the past 15
years is real. The UN estimate of 1.77 for China’s TFR in 2005–2010 was based on oﬃcial
estimates. However, Gu and Cai (2009) argue that current Chinese TFR is lower, at about

14

1.5, summarizing several other studies (Retherford et al. 2005; Zhang and Zhao 2006; Cai
2008; Morgan, Guo, and Hayford 2009). A decline of the TFR to 1.5 over the past 15 years
would also be more in line with the experience of other countries than the reported abrupt
end of the decline. Reflecting this, our 80% projection intervals are also compatible with a
lower current TFR value.
United States: The United States is the only country so far that has recovered to replacement level from a below-replacement turnaround (about 1.75 in the mid-1970s). Our
projection is flat, with a width of about half a child. The UN projection declines fairly
quickly to 1.85, and stays there. This value of 1.85 is on the edge of our 80% interval. By
comparison, the US Census Bureau projects a TFR of 2.0 in 2045–2049, which is higher than
the UN projection and well within our interval.
Preston and Hartnett (2008) analyzed the eﬀect of population changes on fertility, and
concluded that the two most predictable changes in population composition, educational
attainment and ethnicity, are expected to induce relatively small changes in fertility by
2025–29, and that these changes essentially cancel one another out. Their estimated changes
in the TFR related to the tempo eﬀect, increasing ratio of female to male earnings, and
possible restrictions on abortion access (0.15, -0.24 and 0.1 respectively) would yield TFR
projections that are within our projection interval.
Israel: Israel is an unusual case because it has a technologically advanced market economy,
but its TFR of 2.8 is much higher than in most other such countries. Over the past 60 years
its fertility has declined, but more slowly than in most other countries. Our projection
reflects this, with a likely slow decline for the rest of the century. In contrast, the UN
projects a faster decline.
DellaPergola (2007, 2009) and Nahmias and Stecklov (2007) analyzed proximate determinants of fertility in Israel, including fertility intentions, and concluded that future fertility
decline would be slow, or perhaps non-existent. Our projection is compatible with this, with
an upper bound for 2045–2050 of 2.6, only 0.2 children below the current level. The unusual
nature of the Israeli fertility transition is reflected in a relatively wide projection interval of
one child in 2045–2049.
India: India has a TFR of 2.8 and has had a typical, fairly rapid fertility decline. The
Bayesian median projection indicates that the steady decline will continue to below replacement level, bottoming out late in the century and followed by a gradual recovery that will
likely continue into the next century. As with other countries with mid-level fertility, there

15

is considerable uncertainty about the timing, leading to fairly wide projection intervals of
slightly less than one child.
Mozambique: Like most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Mozambique’s TFR of
5.1 is high and has experienced a late and slow fertility decline. Reflecting this, our method
projects a continued slow decline. It also reflects considerable uncertainty, with an interval
of width 1.6 children in 2045–2049.
The UN projects a faster decline than our method, for Mozambique as well as most other
high-fertility countries. This is because the UN method is restricted to a small number of
double logistic decline functions, none of which fit the Mozambique experience well, as shown
in Figure 4(c). In contrast, the double logistic curve estimated by the Bayesian method does
fit the Mozambique experience well.
This is the largest diﬀerence between the UN medium projection and the Bayesian median projection for the selected countries. For 2045–50 in Mozambique these are 2.4 (UN),
and 2.6 (Bayesian). The US Census Bureau projection is much higher than either, at 3.2,
anticipating an even slower decline. Guengant and May (2002) analyzed the proximate determinants of fertility, including contraceptive use, in sub-Saharan Africa, and concluded
that the fertility decline was likely to continue to be slow. Timaeus and Moultrie (2008) and
Moultrie and Timaeus (2009) analyzed the evidence for stopping, spacing and postponing
in these countries, and also concluded that continued slow decline is the most likely future.
These analyses lead to conclusions similar to those from our method.
Regional averages: A summary of the average results by region for 2045–50 is given in
Table 2. Western, Middle and Eastern Africa have the highest projected fertility in 2045–50
and the widest projection intervals, because of high current levels of fertility. The mean
uncertainty as given by the 80% projection interval is around 1.4 children. The widths of
the 80% projection intervals are around 1 child for Asia, Latin America and the Pacific, and
around 0.6 children for Europe. The widths of the 95% projection intervals are about 50%
wider than the widths of the 80% projection intervals.
Diﬀerences by 2045–2050 between the UN medium TFR projection and the BPM median
TFR projection are overall small for regional averages (|12|% at most). Main diﬀerences between the two approaches can be roughly summarized as follows; for regions with countries
that have experienced fast fertility declines in recent decade(s), the BPM projects lower
fertility by 2045–2050 than in the current UN projection (e.g., Asia, Northern and Southern
Africa), while for other regions with high-fertility countries in 2005–2010 that have experienced slower fertility declines, the BPM projects a slower fertility decline than in the UN

16

projection (e.g., Western, Eastern and Middle Africa and part of Oceania).

Model validation
We validated our projection model using out-of-sample projections. In the first set of outof-sample projections, we used the Bayesian projection model to construct projections for
1980–2010 based on the UN estimates up to and including the five-year period 1975–1980.
In the second set of out-of-sample projections, we used the BPM to construct projections
for 1995–2010 based on the UN estimates up to and including the five-year period 1990–
1995. The first set of projections was compared to the UN estimates for the six five-year
periods from 1980–1985 up to 2005–2010, and the second set of projections was compared to
the UN estimates for the three five-year periods 1995–2000, 2000–2005 and 2005–2010. In
17

both comparisons, we did not include countries that were still in Phase I at the start of the
projection period. This is because currently there are no countries in Phase I, so predictive
performance for these countries is not relevant to the current projection task.
Table 3 shows the proportion of left-out UN estimates that fall outside their projection
intervals. If the projection model is valid, on average we expect about 10% of the values
to fall above the upper bound of the 80% projection interval and about 10% to fall below
its lower bound. Similarly, we expect about 2.5% to fall above the upper bound of the
95% interval and about 2.5% to fall below its lower bound. The projection intervals were
reasonably well calibrated in both out-of-sample projections, although the TFR was slightly
overpredicted in the more recent periods.

estimates that falls above the median projected TFR, and above or below their 80% and 95%

DISCUSSION
We have proposed a new unified approach to projecting the total fertility rate for all countries
of the world. It uses a Bayesian projection model that incorporates worldwide fertility
experience over the last 60 years. The method produces a full predictive distribution of
future fertility trajectories. We assessed it in terms of out-of-sample predictive performance,
and it yielded reasonably well-calibrated intervals.
To summarize our results in this paper we have presented the median projections and
18

80% and 95% projection intervals. For policy planning purposes, the 80% projection interval
may often give enough insight into future scenarios. It has the appealing interpretation that
there is one chance in ten of the true value being above the interval, and one chance in ten
of it being below. The 95% projection interval is wider and can be viewed as encompassing
most plausible possibilities.
The projection intervals as presented here are based on the UN estimates of past and
current TFR. However, the UN estimates themselves measure the true TFR with some error,
and to that extent our projections may underestimate uncertainty about future true TFR.
They can be viewed validly as probabilistic projections of future UN TFR estimates. Ideally,
uncertainty about the UN estimates would be incorporated into our uncertainty assessment,
but the wide variation in data availability and quality around the world makes this diﬃcult.
For one eﬀort to assess uncertainty about the UN TFR estimates, see Alkema et al. (2008b).
It is possible that the projections could be improved by including information about
future trends in determinants or predictors of fertility, such as child mortality and economic
development. However, this would require good projections of these variables themselves far
into the future, and they are arguably harder to predict than fertility itself. This has been
done for several countries at the national level (Lutz 1994; Sanderson 1998). However, it
would be hard to do this for all countries on a comparable basis.
The projections produced by our method could in practice provide a basis for UN projections of future TFR, to be evaluated and if necessary revised by the UN analysts. Recent
values and short-term projections of proximate determinants such as contraceptive use and
fertility intentions could be especially useful for doing this. As these are not available on
a uniform basis for all countries, modifications of the results of our method based on these
could be incorporated in a more informal way by analysts, as is currently done with the UN’s
deterministic projections.

The complete fertility transition model is given by:
fc,t+1 = fc,t − dc,t + εc,t , for c = 1, . . . , C, t = τc , . . . , λc − 1,
εc,t ∼ N (0, σ(fc,t )2 ), for t �= τc ,

εc,τc ∼ N (mτ , s2τ ),

dc,t = d(θ c , λc , τc , fc,t ),

if τc ≥ 1950 − 1955;
for τc < 1950 − 1955,

where Mc = max fc,t is the maximum observed TFR outcome in country c, and Lc,t denote
t

local maxima. The upper bound of the prior distribution for Uc for countries in which the
decline had possibly already started before 1950–1955 is based on the observed maximum in
the UN estimates, namely 8.7. Its lower bound is the minimum of the maximum observed
TFR value and 5.5 children (5.5 children is based on examining decline curves, the minimum
level at which the decline starts is slightly under 6).
The expression for the standard deviation σ(fc,t ) of the distortion terms after start period
τc is:
�
�
��
σ(fc,t ) = c1975 (t) σ0 + (fc,t − S) −aI[S,∞) (fc,t ) + bI[0,S) (fc,t ) ,

where σ0 is the maximum standard deviation of the distortions, attained at TFR level S,
and a and b are multipliers of the standard deviation, to model the linear decrease for larger
and smaller outcomes of the TFR. The constant c1975 (t) is added to model the higher error
variance of the distortions before 1975, and is given by:
�
c1975 , t ∈ [1950 − 1955, 1970 − 1975];
c1975 (t) =
1,
t ∈ [1975 − 1980, ∞).

j=1 exp(γcj )
γci ∼ N (αi , δi2 ).

The country-specific parameters in the model are given by {γci , Uc , dc , �c4 }, i = 1, 2, 3.

The hyperparameters in the model are given by {χ, ψ 2 , �4 , δ4 , α, δ} and {a, b, S, σ0 , c1975 , mτ , sτ }.
The prior distributions on the hyperparameters are given by:
χ ∼ N (−1.5, 0.62 ),

1/ψ 2 ∼ Gamma(1, 0.62 ),
α1 ∼ N (−1, 1),
α2 ∼ N (0.5, 1),
α3 ∼ N (1.5, 1),

1/δi2 ∼ Gamma(1, 1), for i = 1, . . . , 4
δ4 ∼ N (0.3, 1),
a ∼ U [0, 0.2],
b ∼ U [0, 0.2],
σ0 ∼ U [0.01, 0.6],
c1975 ∼ U [0.8, 2],
S ∼ U [3.5, 6.5],

mτ ∼ N (−0.25, 0.42 ),

1/s2τ ∼ Gamma(1, 0.42 ),
The prior distributions on the hyperparameters are chosen based on (i) initial least-squares
fits to fertility declines in countries that had observed most of the transition and/or (ii)
guesses of reasonable outcomes. All priors are more spread out than their posterior distributions (i.e. the posterior is determined mostly by the data).
26

A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to get samples of the posterior
distributions of each of the parameters of the fertility transition model (Gelfand and Smith
1990). This algorithm is a combination of Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings and slice
sampling steps (Neal 2003).
The MCMC sampling algorithm was implemented in the statistical package R. The results
are based on a run of 102,000 iterations, discarding the first 2,000. Convergence of all model
parameters was assessed using the run length diagnostic of Raftery and Lewis (1992, 1996).
The length of the MCMC chain exceeded the required sample size for estimating the 2.5%
and 97.5% percentiles of the posterior distributions of all model parameters to within +/0.0125 accuracy with probability 0.95. Convergence of αi , i = 1, 2, 3, was assessed on the
�
transformed scale, i.e. αi /( 3j=1 αj ), as these parameters are only weakly identified on

their original scale (the likelihood of the data conditional on these parameters, and thus the
projections, are not altered when adding a constant to all three αi ’s). Similarly for the γci ’s,
�
i = 1, 2, 3, c = 1, . . . , C, convergence was assessed for γci /( 3j=1 γcj ), i = 1, 2, 3, c = 1, . . . , C.
