Abstract
Despite the desire to focus on the interconnected nature of politics and economics at the
global scale, most empirical studies in the field of international relations assume that the
major actors are not only sovereign, but also that their relationships are independent phenomena. In contrast, this article illustrates the use of linear and bilinear random effects
models to represent statistical dependencies that often characterize dyadic data such as international relations. In particular, we show how to estimate models for dyadic data that
simultaneously take into account:
a) regressor variables,
b) correlation of actions having the same actor,
c) correlation of actions having the same target,
d) correlation of actions between a pair of actors(i.e. reciprocity of actions), and
e) third-order dependencies, such as transitivity, clustering, and balance.
We apply this new approach to the political relations among a wide range of political actors
in Central Asia over the period from 1989-1999, illustrating the presence and strength of
second- and third-order statistical dependencies in these data.

Introduction

Why has interdependence been ignored by empirical analysis in the field of international
relations? Part of the answer resides in the long-standing tradition of ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù in
world politics. Certainly since John Herz‚Äô (1950) association of idealism and realism in the
sovereignty of the nation-state, world politics has been conceived of as the relationships of
sovereign entities, despite increasing evidence to the contrary. The geopolitical perspective
that undergirds a realist perspective on politics goes far back into the 19th Century. R¬®atzel,
Kjell¬¥en, Haushofer, and MacKinder, among others, promoted this geopolitical undergirding
for world politics, an understanding that was quite successful in policy circles in Continental
Europe (certainly in England and Germany) as well as in the United States.1 The incorporation of these ideas‚Äìespecially the notion of lebensraum‚Äìinto the foreign policies of the

Third Reich and especially the policy role played by Haushofer and his most famous student,
Rudolph Hess, brought great, formal disregard for geopolitics in the post-World War II era. 2
Despite the widespread disrepute of geopolitics, its basic tenets guided much foreign policy throughout the last century. In this perspective, states were seen as irreducible objects.
This meant that geopolitics, epitomized best perhaps by Henry Kissinger in the policy realm
and by Hans Morgenthau in the scholarly community, implied an evaluation of world politics with a focus on the heft of monadic objects called states, a heft ascribed primarily to
their ‚Äúpower‚Äù seen in the ability of individual states to affect the overall global geopolitical
equilibrium. The main assumption of this conceptualization of politics is that world politics
is (over)determined by the characteristics and actions of organizations asserting ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù
control over territory. This idea places very little importance on interactions, except as they
may affect the heft or power of the individual nations in the global system.
Most analyses of world politics and studies of national security policies recognize the
interdependence among the salient actors across the salient issues, but typically ignore this
interdependence. Traditionally, international politics has been defined as the scope and
extent of the relations among independent countries, thought to be the most important
elements in world politics. This means that actors as well as their actions are strategically interdependent (Signorino 1999). Ignoring the interdependence among these phenomena would appear to be a serious oversight that plague attempts to understand, let alone
predict, the course of national security policy and world politics more generally. Quantitative, systematic studies of international relations and national security typically assume
that the major events that comprise world politics consist of the independent actions of
independent actors. An exception is analysis via game theoretic models, but these rarely
deal with more than two actors at a time. Some beginning attempts to model the empirical interdependency in international relations have appeared in the literature (Ward and
Kirby 1987; Smith 1999; Gleditsch and Ward 2001; Gleditsch and Ward 2001; Ward and
Gleditsch 2002; Gleditsch 2002; Lofdahl 2002; Przeworski and Vreeland 2002).
Social network analysis is a broad area of social science research that has been developed
to describe the relationships among interdependent units. It is somewhat surprising that to
date there are no published applications using a social network framework to study international relations3 , since it is evident at first blush that international politics is about the
interdependencies that appear around the world. This is perhaps due to the fact that most
tools for social network analysis are focused on the simple case of binary (0-1) relations,
where the data can be represented by a simple graph (see Wasserman and Faust 1994 for
a review). Dealing with non-binary data (such as counts or continuous data) or regressor
variables has not been well addressed in the social networks literature (see Hoff, Raftery, and
Handcock 2002 for a discussion).
Herein, we develop a generalized regression framework for analyzing and accounting for

Hess, for example, sent Karl Haushofer to negotiate with BeneÀòs during the Sudeten Crisis of 1938.
Steven J. Brams (1966; 1968) and later Schofield (1972) tried to estimate linkages among countries, but
this line of research was not pursued. Some work with elementary graph theory in the field of international
relations has appeared more recently (Lai 1995), but like most of the early work, this applies to a small number
of actors, typically three. Zeev Maoz and colleagues (2003) have begun to investigate this descriptive thread
of social network analysis in the context of international relations.

the dependencies in valued and binary dyadic international relations data. This approach
builds on the social relations model (Warner, Kenny and Stoto 1979; Wong 1982) that specifies random effects for the originator and recipient of a relation or action, as well as allowing
for within dyad correlation of relations.4 We expand upon previous approaches by allowing
for certain kinds of third-order dependence using an inner product of latent, unobserved
characteristic vectors. The use of inner products to model dependencies is new, and related
to the the recent development of ‚Äúlatent space‚Äù models for dyadic data (Hoff, Raftery and
Handcock 2002; Ward, Hoff and Lofdahl 2003; Hoff 2003b). The idea of measuring latent
characteristics or positions of political actors has a long lineage in political science, though
not in international relations.5

A Model of Dependent, Dyadic Interactions

Dyadic data are replete in studies of international relations. Bilateral trade (Mansfield and
Pollins 2003), the presence of conflicts and crises among countries (Brecher and Wilkenfeld
2000; Wilkenfeld 2001), alliances (Gartzke and Simon 1996; Leeds 2003), and joint membership in international and nongovernmental organizations (Russett, Oneal and Berbaum
2003), each provides a ready example of international phenomenon that can be viewed as
dyadic. Let Y denote an n √ó n matrix that contains dyadic measurements, so that the i, jth
entry yi,j is the measurement of the relation from i to j. The matrix Y is often called a
socio-matrix. Similarly, let X denote an n √ó n √ó r array, so that xi,j is a vector of length r
describing characteristics specific to dyad (i, j).
It is typical to model these kind of data via a linear regression approach
yi,j = Œ≤ 0 xi,j + i,j .

(1)

Examples of this kind of model are common in the so-called democratic peace literature,
although the errors i,j are typically treated as independent. In contrast, we develop a
random effects model that can account for various second and third order dependencies that
may be present in such dyadic data.6
We begin by assuming the errors {i,j , i 6= j} have a covariance that is exchangeable
under identical permutations of the indices i, j of the senders and receivers. With the added
assumption of normality, this implies the residuals can be represented in terms of a linear
4

This work also builds upon advances in techniques for decomposition of variances (Li 2002; Li and
Loken 2002; Gill and Swartz 2001).

Oneal (2001), and Bennett and Stam (2000). However, each of these studies ignores the network aspects of
the dyadic data on which they are based.

where œÉa2 represents dependence among measurements having a common sender, œÉb2 represents
dependence among measurements having a common receiver, and œÅ represents correlation of
measurements within a dyad, i.e. reciprocity. The above model has been called the ‚Äúsocial
relations‚Äù or ‚Äúround robin‚Äù model (Warner, Kenny, and Stoto 1979, Wong 1982), and has
been recently studied by Gill and Swartz (2001) and Li and Loken (2002).
To accommodate other data types such as counts or binary measurements, the error
structure in (2) can be integrated into a linear predictor in the framework of a generalized
linear model in which the dyadic data are conditionally independent given the random effects,
but are unconditionally dependent:

p(y1,2 . . . yn,n‚àí1

Œ∏i,j = Œ≤ 0 xi,j + ai + bj + Œ≥i,j
E(yi,j | Œ∏i,j ) = g(Œ∏i,j )
Y
| Œ∏1,2 . . . Œ∏n,n‚àí1 ) =
p(yi,j | Œ∏i,j ),

(3)

i6=j

where g(¬∑) is the inverse-link function. For example, letting g(Œ∏i,j ) = eŒ∏i,j and yi,j |Œ∏i,j ‚àº
Poisson (eŒ∏i,j ) is equivalent to a mixed-effects Poisson regression model with the log-link.
The random-effects model above can capture second-order forms of dependence such as
reciprocity and within-actor correlation. However, the social network literature (Wasserman
and Faust 1994) suggests that third-order dependence patterns, such as transitivity and
balance, are often found in dyadic data. Indeed, international relations would seem to be
replete with these phenomena. For binary data, transitivity describes the dependence among
three nodes i, j, k in which i and k are more likely to be linked if i and j are linked and j
and k are linked. For signed measurements, such as residuals, a triad is called ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù
if the product of the measurements among the three nodes is positive, i.e. i,j j,k k,i > 0.
A weaker concept similar to balance is clusterability, in which a positive relation between i
and j implies that i,k and j,k will have the same sign for each other node k. A set of nodes
4

that are perfectly ‚Äúclusterable‚Äù can be partitioned into groups that have all positive linkages
within groups and negative linkages between groups.7 In practice, dyadic data will exhibit
varying degrees of transitivity, balance, and clusterability.
Building on Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002) we use unobserved latent characteristic
vectors to represent transitivity, balance, and clusterability among dyadic data. We define
an unobserved, latent K-dimensional vector zi for each node i in the network, which can be
thought of as representing a position in an unobserved latent characteristic space of dimension
k. Modelling the response between two nodes as an increasing function of the similarity of
their latent characteristics induces a pattern of transitivity, balance, and clusterability into
the network. We achieve this effect mathematically by adding the inner product zi0 zj to the
linear predictor (3) to yield
i,j = ai + bj + Œ≥i,j + zi0 zj .

(4)

Note that if the vectors zi and zj have similar direction and magnitude, then zi0 zj will be
positive and the effects zi0 zk and zj0 zk will be similar to each other, thus representing balance
and clusterability. Similarly, if zi0 zj and zj0 zk are both positive then zi0 zk is likely to be positive
as well, thus representing transitivity.8
The inner product term is one way to measure a latent similarity - Hoff, Raftery and
Handcock (2002) discuss other ways of establishing the topology of latent space, including
distance and projection approaches. The inner product used in the above model has the
appeal of being analogous to an ‚Äúerror term‚Äù and facilitating substantive interpretation as
a random or fixed effect. Considered as a random effect, if the zi ‚Äôs are independent samples
from a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix œÉz2 I, then
the expectation of zi0 zj is zero. Furthermore, this inner-product term induces a third order
dependence that captures transitivity and balance via the expectation of the third order
moment E(i,j j,k k,i ). The incorporation of zi0 zj into the linear predictor gives
E(2i,j ) = œÉa2 + 2œÉab + œÉb2 + œÉŒ≥2 + KœÉz4
E(i,j j,i ) = œÅœÉŒ≥2 + 2œÉab + kœÉz4
E(i,j j,k k,i ) = kœÉz6 ,
with other second order moments given as above and all other third order moments equal to
zero. Alternatively, as a fixed effect the inner-product term can be thought of as a reducedrank interaction term. In this context, it has been called a ‚Äúbilinear effect‚Äù or ‚Äúmultiplicative
interaction‚Äù (Gabriel 1978; Gabriel 1998).
We re-parameterize the bilinear model given above as
Œ∏i,j = Œ≤d0 xd,i,j + si + ri + Œ≥i,j + zi0 zj
si = Œ≤s0 xs,i + ai
ri = Œ≤r0 xr,i + bi

These ideas were introduced into international relations in the 1960s to the balance of power (Zinnes
1967), but have been applied more recently by Lai (1995) to study reciprocity among superpowers.

separating regressors xd,i,j that are specific to a dyad (i, j), from those specific to a sender
xs,i or receiver xr,j . Bayesian estimation of model parameters is made feasible by use of a
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which samples values of the parameters from their
posterior distributions: We construct a Markov chain in {Œ≤d , Œ≤s , Œ≤r , Œ£ab , Z, œÉz2 , Œ£Œ≥ } (where
Z is the K √ó n matrix of latent vectors) that eventually samples from the desired target
posterior distribution p(Œ≤d , Œ≤s , Œ≤r , Œ£ab , Z, œÉz2 , Œ£Œ≥ | Y ). The algorithm proceeds by iterating
three basic steps:
1. Resampling of linear effects:
(a) sample Œ≤d , s, r | Œ≤s , Œ≤r , Œ£ab , Œ£Œ≥ , Œ∏, Z (similar to a linear regression);
(b) sample Œ≤s , Œ≤r | s, r, Œ£ab , Œ£Œ≥ , Œ∏, Z (similar to a linear regression);
(c) sample Œ£ab , Œ£Œ≥ from their full conditional distributions.
2. Resampling of bilinear effects:
(a) for each i, sample zi | {zj : j 6= i}, Œ∏, Œ≤, s, r, Œ£z , Œ£Œ≥ (similar to linear regression);
(b) sample Œ£z from its full conditional distribution.
3. Resampling of dyad-specific parameters: update {Œ∏i,j , Œ∏j,i } using a Metropolis-Hastings

If conjugate priors are used, then all parameters in steps 1 and 2 can be sampled from their
full conditional distributions. In this case, the full conditionals for the regression terms
Œ≤d , s, r, Œ≤s , Œ≤r , Z are multivariate normal, and the covariance terms have inverse-Wishart
conditional distributions. (more details on the full conditionals are available in Hoff (2003a)).
This estimation procedure essentially provides a decomposition of Œ∏i,j into regressor,
sender, receiver, and latent position effects in a generalized regression framework. This
allows for the modeling of binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian network data in the presence of
second and third order dependence. In the subsequent section we employ this approach to
estimate the dependencies in dyadic data on the political interactions in Central Asia.9

Estimation of Network Links in Central Asia

We use the bilinear mixed effects model to estimate the network structure of the political
interactions among the primary actors in Central Asian politics over the period from 1989
through 1999. This region has a great deal of conflict and spotty coverage in English language
media, despite its contemporary salience. Event data collection has provided one way to

examine the politics of such regions. Event data are nominal or ordinal codings of the
recorded interactions of international actors.10 Berelson (1952) introduced the concept of
content analysis to the social sciences, but it was North, Holsti, Zaninovich and Zinnes
(1963) that pioneered its use in studies of world politics. Event data have been widely used
in quantitative international relations research and in policy research for four decades (North
1967; McClelland and Hoggard 1969; Azar 1980). Until the development of machine coding,
the World Event Interaction Survey (WEIS) and Conflict on Peace Databank (COPDAB)
were the two dominant schema. The contemporary, state-of-the-art is found in the Kansas
Event Data System (KEDS) which uses automated coding of English-language news reports
to generate political event data (Schrodt 2000; Schrodt, Davis and Weddle 1994).
While most event data analyses in the field of international relations have focused on the
interactions of countries, writ large, there is no reason to presume that national governments
are the only actors in world politics. We include both countries and non-countries as actors
and targets. The initial database was taken from the Kansas Event Data Survey, an automated textually oriented data generating process (Schrodt, Davis and Weddle 1994; Gerner,
Schrodt, Francisco and Weddle 1994), available from http://www.ku.edu/ keds/data.html.
The CASIA database records approximately 30, 000 events concerning Central Asian politics
over the period from 1989-1999. Based on the CASIA database, there are 106 such actors
with substantial interactions that have been deemed by substantive experts to be significant.
Of these, there are 66 countries, and 40 non-country actors.11 For the purposes of most of
our analyses, we sum the paired interactions among all actors across the eleven year period,
so yi,j is the total number of directed interactions from actor i to actor j, resulting in a
106 √ó 106 sociomatrix Y .
We examine separately the conflictual and cooperative interactions among these 106
actors. Conflictual interactions are defined as those having a negative Goldstein scale score
(1992); cooperation is defined a events that have been assigned a positive score on this scale.
Goldstein scale values, ranging from -10 (extreme conflict) to 8.3 (extreme cooperation)
are psychometrically determined weights, where a positive weight means that the event has
positive affect; conversely, a negative Goldstein score indicates negative affect.
We model the count of cooperative or conflictual interactions among these 106 actors
using the generalized bilinear model, using a Poisson distribution with a log-link. We include
sender and receiver random effects, as well as a 2 dimensional latent space or bilinear effect. 12

United Nations, and the Vatican.

7

In addition, we employ the so-called Tobler law of geography (Tobler 1979) to reflect the
fact that actors that are close geographically have a higher rate of interaction. Although it is
impossible to determine with certainty the geographical ‚Äúlocation‚Äù of most non-state actors‚Äì
where, for example are ‚Äúinternational negotiators‚Äù located‚Äìwe can with some confidence
determine the nearest neighbor distances of the state actors (Gleditsch and Ward 2001). To
gauge inter-country distances, we use nearest neighbor distance (Gleditsch and Ward 2001)
up to 950 kilometers complemented by the distance in thousands of kilometers between the
capital city of each of the countries for larger distances.13 We also allow for the possibility
that countries will have a different propensity for dyadic interaction than non-country actors,
both on the cooperative and conflictual scales. Therefore, we model the rate of interaction
between two actors as depending on the country/non-country status of both the sender and
receiver. The hierarchical model specifying these ideas is given by:
Œ∏i,j = Œ≤0 + Œ≤s √ó (i ‚àà c) + Œ≤r √ó (j ‚àà c) + Œ≤1 √ó (i, j ‚àà c) + Œ≤2 xi,j √ó (i, j ‚àà c) + (6)
ai + bj + zi0 zj + Œ≥i,j ,
yi,j |Œ∏i,j ‚àº Poisson(eŒ∏i,j )
where xi,j is the distance between countries i and j (in thousands of kilometers), and c is
the set of countries. The fixed effects, shown above in the first line of equation 6, are further
detailed in Table 1.14
Table 1: Fixed effects for dyads involving countries and non-countries. i ‚àà c indicates
that actor i is a country; i 6‚àà c indicates that actor i is not a country, but an individual,

Figure 1: The posterior density and a time-series plot of the Markov chain for the distance
parameter for the cooperation data. The mean response is greater for actors that are closer
together geographically, and the estimated coefficient is ‚àí0.079; 95% empirical confidence
interval is [‚àí0.044, ‚àí0.116]. See Table 2 for posterior means and confidence intervals for all
estimated parameters. Note that this image is rotated ‚àí50‚ó¶ to provide perspective.
The parameter estimates are presented for conflict and cooperation in Table 2. These
estimates illustrate that the differences between networks of conflict and cooperation are
not immense, but are recognizably different. There is a strong distance effect for both
cooperation and conflict: the rate of political interaction is inversely related to distance, as
expected, as both of the parameters are negative. The distance effect is about 30% greater for
conflict than cooperation. This particular effect only applies to dyads for which the distance
measurement makes sense, i.e., for dyads in which both nodes are countries (see Table 1).
The effect of being a country seems about 40% stronger for conflict than for cooperation.
This suggests that countries are more likely to share conflict linkages. The effects of countries
being separately senders and receivers illustrates that countries are twice as likely to send
cooperation, but more likely to receive conflict. The estimates of œÅ indicate a large degree of
reciprocity in reported actions, but it is substantially higher in cooperative social relations
than in conflictual ones. This indicates a large degree of within-dyad dependence.
The model also detects a large degree of sender and receiver specific variance, as well
as third order dependence, as œÉa2 , œÉb2 and the variance of the inner-products œÉz20 z are all
larger than œÉŒ≥2 . Finally, Figure 2 presents posterior means of random effects for senders and
receivers for conflict. The actors have similar random effects orderings across both domains
of dyadic interaction,though only conflict orderings are presented herein.

presented for the major parameters (given in bold) of the bilinear effects model as applied to
both conflict and cooperation among 106 major political actors in Central Asia, 1989-1999.
Broad comparison shows that there is a similar structure to cooperation and conflict. Countries that are distant geographically have lower interaction rates in both domains. Cooperative
events are more highly reciprocated within dyads than conflictual ones. Strong second and
third order dependence is evident in both cooperative and conflictual dyadic interactions.

Note: Data are available from http://www.ku.edu/‚àºkeds/data.html, and are briefly described above. Statistics presented are from runs of 200K
iterations with output sampled every 50 iterations; the first 50K iterations were discarded as ‚Äúburn-in‚Äù, although results are not appreciably
different if they are included. Two latent dimensions were estimated for both domains, i.e., K = 2.

color. Each actor is assigned a unique color in a way so that actors with similar latent
position values have similar colors. Thus, the clusters of dots of similar colors reflect both
the clustering of actors with similar positions, as well as the estimated uncertainty of these
positions. This figure shows that there is considerable clustering in the estimated dyadic
relations. The top panel and the bottom panel are similar, showing that there are similar
patterns to both conflict and cooperation in the political interactions in Central Asia. In
the top panel, several clusters are identifiable. The lower left hand portion is dominated by
actors involved in the Armenian and Azerbaijan conflict which dominated the later part of
the 1980s in Central Asia. Central European involvement in Kosovo with its implications
for Central Asia cluster above this, with the Vatican, CSCE, NATO, and other European
actors being visible. At the same time, the ebb and flow of politics in southern Central Asia,
particularly Afghanistan, Pakistan present a visible cluster in the lower right of the latent
space. Immediately above that one finds the cluster of Middle Eastern, Moslem, and Arab
actors. The bottom panel illustrates similar clusterings for conflict interactions in Central
Asia.
In terms of prediction, the bilinear effects approach is quite accurate. For an arbitrary
draw‚Äìthe 200, 000th‚Äìfrom the posterior distribution, we compare the predicted number of
linkages between actors i and j. The correlation of the predicted number of linkages and the

Figure 2: Orderings of sender-specific and receiver-specific random effects are similar for
the conflict data. The United States, the United Nations, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan are actors with large, positive random effects sending and receiving both
conflict and cooperation (not shown).
actual number of linkages is 0.85 for conflict and 0.86 for cooperation.15 If we compare the
predicted fit for the fixed effects model estimated with no latent positions (i.e., with K = 0)
with this same model using 2 latent dimensions, it is apparent that the fit is improved by
the inclusion of the latent positions in the model. The correlation between predicted and
actual number of cooperative events in the latter case is 0.85, compared to 0.75 when no
latent positions are estimated.
While the in-sample fit of the model is strong, it is also important to gauge its outof-sample predictive performance. This provides an important heuristic to determine the
predictive value added for the random effects specified in the model. To examine this we
undertook a small comparative study of out-of-sample predictive performance For both the
cooperation and conflict data, one-third of the data was randomly replaced with missing
values, and three models were fit using the remaining ‚Äúin-sample‚Äù data. The first uses
only the fixed-effects (i.e., only the Œ≤ coefficients); a second model additionally includes
random intercepts having country-specific sender and receiver effects; and the third model
also includes the inner product effect zi0 zj , with K = 2. The posterior mean parameter
values were then used to predict the one-third of the data reserved as ‚Äúout-of-sample‚Äù, and
15

These are an order of magnitude larger than for a simple model that ignores dependencies.

11

Table 3: Correlation between observed values and out-of-sample predictions: The out-ofsample predictions show the marginal benefits of modeling the sender and receiver random
effects, as well as the additional predictive gain of the inner product of latent positions.
For cooperation a generalized linear model produces out-of-sample predictions that have a
correlation of 0.13 with out-of-sample measurements, which rises to 0.68 when random effects
for senders and receivers are included and to 0.86 when the inner product of latent positions
is also modeled. The gain is even stronger for conflict, rising from 0.07 in the first instance
to 0.91 in the last. These patterns are less striking when measured on the log scale, but still
evident.

the correlations of predicted and actual responses were computed in a raw, untransformed as
well as a logarithmic scale.16 Table 3 presents the results of this out-of-sample experiment.
The addition of the random effects‚Äìspanning the random intercepts for senders and receivers as well as the inner product of the latent positions‚Äìincreases predictive performance
substantially, viewed in terms of the correlation between actual and predicted responses.
The effect is particularly dramatic on the raw scale of the data, for which the inner product
model is able to predict some very high responses, whereas the other models cannot.

Conclusion
This article presents a generalizable way to account for types of second and third order dependencies in regression models for dyadic data. Most current analyses in political science‚Äìand
especially international relations‚Äìignore all of these dependencies. The latent space, bilinear
regression approach is major step forward for analysts interested in the interdependencies
of dyadic data that are often used to characterize world politics. The latent space approach
provides a practical framework that can be used to empirically estimate and display a range
of important dependence patterns in dyadic data.
This alone is an important breakthrough. Moreover, the approach facilitates the presentation of latent positions in an intuitively satisfying way, mapped into a small number of
dimensions. Confidence regions for these latent positions are also available via the Markov
chain Monte Carlo procedure, allowing for prediction of unmeasured relations, as well as
confidence statements about such predictions. Perhaps most importantly this approach is
quite general, since it encapsulates a broad class of models. Specifically, a variety of discrete
and continuous specifications can easily be adapted, depending upon the data generating
process. This allows scholars to embrace interdependence in an empirical framework that is
16

A small constant was added so that the correlation on the log scale was computed as cor [log(.1+y i,j ), Œ∏ÀÜi,j ].

not only rich in description at the sub-national, national, multi- and transnational, as well
as systemic levels, but one that is also firmly rooted in well-understood statistical methods
such as generalized linear regression and random effects modeling.

Figure 3: A sample of the estimated posterior latent positions in two dimensions identifies
nodes that are similar in their patterns of interaction.
Actors have the same color over sam14
ples from the Markov chain; each actor has a unique color. Those actors with similar latent
positions will have similar colors. The posterior mean position for each actor is located at the
center of the text string identifying it. Only the last 100, 000 iterations of the Markov chain
were used in the sampled latent positions presented here. Cooperative and conflictual latent
positions have been rotated to enhance similarity; the inner product of the latent positions is
invariant to such rotations.
