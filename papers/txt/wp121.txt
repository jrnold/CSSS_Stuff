Abstract
The Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System has since 2001 conducted a
biannual household asset survey in order to quantify household socio-economic status (SES)
in a rural population living in northeast South Africa. The data contain binary, ordinal and
nominal items. We aim to describe the SES landscape in the study population by clustering
the households into homogeneous groups based on their asset status.
A model-based approach to clustering, based on latent variable models, is proposed. In
the case of modeling binary or ordinal items, item response models are employed. For nominal
survey items, a factor analysis model, similar in nature to a multinomial probit model, is used.
Both model types have an underlying latent variable structure – this similarity is exploited
and the models are combined to produce a hybrid model capable of handling mixed data
types. Further, a mixture of the hybrid models is considered to provide clustering capabilities
within the context of mixed binary, ordinal and nominal response data. The proposed model
is termed the mixture for factor analyzers for mixed data (MFA-MD).
The MFA-MD model is applied to the SES data to cluster households into homogeneous
groups. The model is estimated within the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm. Intuitive groupings result providing insight to the different socio-economic
strata within the Agincourt region.

Introduction

Categorical data arise in many different fields and are typically collected as responses to
a number of questions or survey items. These responses could be either binary, ordinal or
nominal in nature. A model is presented here which facilitates clustering of observations in
the context of such mixed categorical data. Latent variable modeling ideas are used as the
observed response is viewed as a categorical manifestation of a latent continuous variable(s).
The proposed clustering method is motivated and illustrated by a study of household
socio-economic status conducted by the Agincourt health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in rural northeast South Africa [30]. Asset-based wealth indices are a common
way of quantifying wealth in populations for which alternative methods are not feasible
[48]. Households in the study area have been surveyed biannually since 2001 to elicit an
accounting of assets similar to that used by the Demographic and Health Surveys [44] to
construct a wealth index. We use the most recent measurement for each household. The
resulting dataset contains binary, ordinal and nominal items. Examples of typical survey
items include whether or not a household owns a television, or the type of toilet facilities
used by a household. Based on the asset status data, we are interested in exploring any
clustering structure within the set of Agincourt households, and in uncovering whether underlying clusters relate to different socio-economic strata. Hence a clustering method which
can appropriately model the mixed categorical response data is required.
Several models for clustering mixed data are detailed in the literature. Early work on
modeling such data employed the location model [26, 31, 49], in which the joint distribution
of mixed data is decomposed as the product of the marginal distribution of the categorical
variables and the conditional distribution of the continuous variables, given the categorical
variables. More recently, [27] re-examined these location models in the presence of missing
data. Latent factor models in particular have generated recent interest for modeling mixed
data; [41] uses such models in a political science context. [11, 12] and [38] provide an
early view of clustering mixed data, including the use of latent variable models. More
recently [5], [4] and [21] propose clustering models for mixed data based on a latent variable.
The clustering model proposed here is also based on latent variable models, but differs
from existing models in that it proposes a unifying latent variable framework by elegantly
combining ideas from item response theory and from factor analysis models for nominal data.
Item response modeling is an established method for analyzing binary or ordinal response
data. First introduced by [46], item response theory has its roots in educational testing.
Many authors have contributed to the expansion of this theory since then including [32, 43],
[33] and [47]. Extensions include the graded response model [45] and the partial credit model
[34]. Bayesian approaches to fitting such models are detailed in [29] and [15]. Item response
models assume that each observed ordinal response is a manifestation of a latent continuous
variable. The observed response will be level k, say, if the latent continuous variable lies
within a specific interval. Further, typical item response models assume that the latent
continuous variable is a function of both a respondent specific latent trait variable and item
specific parameters.
Modeling nominal response data is typically more complex than modeling binary or ordinal data as the set of possible responses is unordered. A popular model for nominal choice
data is the multinomial probit (MNP) model [18]. Bayesian approaches to fitting the MNP
i

model have been proposed by [2, 35, 39] and [8]. The model has also been extended to include
multivariate nominal responses by [51]. Typically, the MNP model models nominal response
data as a manifestation of an underlying multidimensional continuous latent variable, which
depends on a respondent’s covariate information and some item specific parameters. Here
a factor analysis model for nominal data, similar in nature to the MNP model, is proposed
where the observed nominal response is a manifestation of the multidimensional latent variable which is itself modeled as a function of both a respondent’s latent trait variable and
some item specific parameters.
The similarities between item response models and the factor analytic version of the
MNP model suggest a hybrid model would be advantageous. Both models have a latent
variable structure underlying the observed data, which exhibits dependence on item specific
parameters. Further, the latent variable in both models has an underlying factor analytic
structure, through the dependency on the latent trait. This similarity is exploited and the
models are combined to produce a hybrid model capable of modeling mixed categorical data
types. This hybrid model can be thought of as a factor analysis model for mixed data.
As stated, the motivating application involves the need to cluster observations based on
mixed categorical data. A model-based approach to clustering is proposed, in that a mixture
modeling framework provides the clustering machinery. Specifically, a mixture of the factor
analytic models for mixed data is considered to provide clustering capabilities within the
context of mixed binary, ordinal and nominal response data. The resulting model is termed
the mixture of factor analyzers for mixed data (MFA-MD). Here, a Bayesian framework is
employed for inference.
The paper proceeds as follows. Background information about the Agincourt region of
South Africa as well as the socio-economic status (SES) survey and resulting data set are
introduced in Section 2. Item response models, a model for nominal response data and
the amalgamation and extension of these models to a MFA-MD model are considered in
Section 3. Section 4 is concerned with Bayesian model estimation and inference. The results
from fitting the model to the SES data set are presented in Section 5. Finally, discussion of
the model and future research areas takes place in Section 6.

The Agincourt HDSS SES Data Set

The Agincourt HDSS [30] continuously monitors the population of 21 villages located in the
Bushbuckridge subdistrict of Mpumalanga Province in northeast South Africa. This is a rural
population living in what was during Apartheid a black ‘homeland’. The Agincourt HDSS
was established in the early 1990s with the purpose of guiding the reorganization of South
Africa’s health system. Since then the goals of the HDSS have evolved and now it contributes
to evaluation of national policy at population, household and individual levels. For more
information on the AHDSS and how the data were collected see www.agincourt.co.za.
The HDSS covers and area of 420km2 consisting of 21 villages with a total population
of approximately 82, 000 people. The infrastructure in the area is mixed. The roads in and
surrounding the study area are in the process of rapidly being upgraded from dirt to tar.
The cost of electricity is prohibitively high for many households though it is available in all
villages. A dam has been constructed nearby but to date there is no piped water to dwellings
ii

and sanitation is rudimentary. The soil in the area is generally suited to game farming and
there is virtually no commercial farming activity. Most households contain wage earners
who purchase maize and other foods which they then supplement with home-grown crops
and collected wild foodstuffs.
The dataset analyzed here describes assets of households in the Agincourt study area.
The data consist of the responses of N = 17, 617 households to each of J = 28 categorical
survey items. There are 22 binary items, 3 ordinal items and 3 nominal items. The binary
items are asset ownership indicators for the most part. These items record whether or not a
household owns a particular asset (e.g. whether or not they own a working car). An example
of an ordinal item is the type of toilet the household uses. This follows an ordinal scale from
no toilet at all to a modern flush toilet. Finally, the power used for cooking is an example
of a nominal item. The household may use electricity, bottled gas or wood, among others.
This is an unordered set since a particular response may not be indicative of socio-economic
status. A full list of survey items and possible responses is given in Appendix A.
Previous analyses of data from this study include a principal component analysis-based
approach by [13] in which the relationship between educational enrollment and wealth is
investigated. Further, [9] construct an asset index for each household which is then used to
divide households into clusters based on the quintiles of this index.

A Mixture of Factor Analysers Model for Mixed
Data

A mixture of factor analyzers model for mixed data (MFA-MD) is proposed to facilitate
clustering of the Agincourt households. Each component of the MFA-MD model is a hybrid
of an item response model and a factor analytic model for nominal data. In this section
item response models for ordinal data and a latent variable model for nominal data are
introduced, before they are combined and extended to the MFA-MD model.

3.1

Item Response Models for Ordinal Data

Suppose item j (for j = 1, . . . , J) is ordinal and the set of possible responses is denoted
{1, 2, . . . , Kj } where Kj denotes the number of response levels to item j. Item response
models assume that, for respondent i, a latent Gaussian variable zij corresponds to each
categorical response yij . Typically, a Gaussian link function is assumed, though other link
functions, such as the logit, are detailed in the item response theory literature [15, 33].

For each ordinal item j there exists a vector of threshold parameters γ j = γj,0 , γj,1 , . . . , γj,Kj .
The elements of this vector are constrained such that
−∞ = γj,0 ≤ γj,1 ≤ . . . ≤ γj,Kj = ∞.
For identifiability reasons [2, 41] typically γj,1 = 0. The observed ordinal response, yij , for
respondent i is a manifestation of the latent variable zij i.e.
if γj,k−1 ≤ zij ≤ γj,k then
iii

yij = k.

That is, if the underlying latent continuous variable lies within a interval bounded by the
threshold parameters γj,k−1 and γj,k , then the observed ordinal response is level k.
In a standard item response model, a factor analytic model is then used to model the
underlying latent variable zij . It is assumed that the mean of the conditional distribution
of zij depends on a q dimensional, respondent specific, latent variable θi and on some item
specific parameters. The latent variable θi is sometimes referred to as the latent trait or a
respondent’s ability parameter in item response theory. Specifically, the underlying latent
variable zij for respondent i and item j is assumed to be distributed as
zij |θi ∼ N (µj + λTj θi , 1).
The parameters λj and µj are usually termed the item discrimination parameters and the
negative item difficulty parameter respectively. Typically, the variance of zij is fixed at 1[2].
Under this model, the conditional probability that a response takes a certain ordinal
value can then be expressed as the difference between two standard Gaussian cumulative
distribution functions:
P (yij = k|λj , µj , γ j , θi ) = Φ[γj,k − (µj + λTj θi )] − Φ[γj,k−1 − (µj + λTj θi )].
Since a binary item can be viewed as an ordinal item with two levels (0 and 1, say)
the item response model can also be used to model binary response data. The threshold
parameter for a binary item j is γ j = (−∞, 0, ∞) and hence for a binary item

P (yij = 1|λj , µj , γ j , θi ) = Φ µj + λTj θi .

3.2

A Factor Analytic Model for Nominal Data

Modeling nominal response data is typically more complicated than modeling ordinal data
since the set of possible responses is no longer ordered. The set of nominal responses for
item j is denoted {1, 2, . . . , Kj } such that 1 corresponds to the first response choice while Kj
corresponds to the last response choice, but where no inherent ordering among the choices
is assumed.
As detailed in Section 3.1, the item response model for ordinal data posits a one dimensional latent variable for each observed ordinal response. In the factor analytic model
for nominal data proposed here, a Kj − 1 dimensional latent variable is required for each
observed nominal response. That is, the latent variable for observation i corresponding to
nominal item j is denoted
K −1
z ij = (zij1 , . . . , zij j ).
The observed nominal response is then assumed to be a manifestation of the values of the
elements of z ij relative to each other and to a cut-off point, assumed to be 0. That is,

{zijk } < 0;

 1 if max
k
yij =

 k if z k−1 = max{z k } and z k−1 > 0 for k = 2, . . . , Kj .

Similar to the item response model, the underlying latent vector z ij is modeled via a factor
analytic model. The mean of the conditional distribution of z ij depends on a respondent
specific, q-dimensional, latent trait variable, θi , and item specific parameters i.e.
z ij |θi ∼ MVNKj −1 (µj + Λj θi , I)
where I denotes the identity matrix. The loadings matrix Λj is a (Kj − 1) × q matrix,
analogous to the item discrimination parameter in the item response model of Section 3.1;
likewise, the mean vector µj is analogous to the item difficulty parameter in the item response
model.

3.3

A Factor Analysis Model for Mixed Data

It is clear that the item response model for ordinal data (Section 3.1) and the factor analytic
model for nominal data (Section 3.2) are similar in structure. Both model the observed data
as a manifestation of an underlying latent variable, which is itself modeled using a factor
analytic structure. This similarity is exploited to obtain a hybrid factor analysis model for
mixed binary, ordinal and nominal data.
Suppose Y , an N × J matrix of mixed data, denotes the data from N respondents to J
survey items. Let O denote the number of binary items plus the number of ordinal items,
leaving J − O nominal items. Without loss of generality, suppose that the binary and ordinal
items are in the first O columns of Y while the nominal items are in the remaining columns.
The binary and ordinal items are modeled using an item response model and the nominal
items using the factor analytic model for nominal data. Therefore, for each respondent i
there are O latent continuous variables corresponding to the ordinal items and J − O latent
continuous vectors corresponding to the nominal items. The latent variables and latent
vectors forPrespondent i are collected together in a single D dimensional vector z i where
D = O + Jj=O+1 (Kj − 1). That is, underlying respondent i’s set of J binary, ordinal and
nominal responses lies the latent vector
KJ −1
1
z i = (zi1 , . . . , ziO , . . . , ziJ
, . . . , ziJ
).

This latent vector is then modeled using a factor analytic structure:
z i |θi ∼ MVND (µ + Λθi , I).

(1)

The D × q dimensional matrix Λ is termed the loadings matrix and µ is the D dimensional
mean vector. Combining the item response and factor analytic models in this way facilitates
the modeling of binary, ordinal and nominal response data in an elegant and unifying latent
variable framework.
The model in (1) provides a parsimonious factor analysis model for the high-dimensional
latent vector z i which underlies the observed mixed data. As in any model which relies
on a factor analytic structure, the loadings matrix details the relationship between the low
dimensional latent trait θi and the high-dimensional latent vector z i . Marginally the latent
vector is distributed as
z i ∼ MVND (µ, ΛΛT + I)
resulting in a parsimonious covariance structure for z i .

A Mixture of Factor Analyzers Model for Mixed Data

To facilitate clustering when the observed data are mixed categorical variables, a mixture
modeling framework can be imposed on the hybrid model defined in Section 3.3. The resulting model is termed the mixture of factor analyzers model for mixed data. In the MFA-MD
model, the clustering is deemed to occur at the underlying latent variable level. That is,
under the MFA-MD model the distribution of the latent data z i is modeled as a mixture of
G Gaussian densities

The probability of belonging to cluster g is denoted by πg where G
g=1 πg = 1 and πg > 0 ∀
g. The mean and loading parameters µg and Λg are specific to cluster g.
As is standard in a model-based approach to clustering [7, 16], a latent indicator variable,
`i = (`i1 , . . . , `iG ) is introduced for each respondent i. This binary vector indicates the cluster
to which individual i belongs i.e. lig = 1 if i belongs to cluster g; all other entries in the vector
are 0. Under the model in (2), the augmented likelihood function for the N respondents is
then given by

The ‘cases’ referred to in the nominal part of the model defined in (3) are as defined as

k

• case 2: if zijk−1 = max{zijk } and zijk−1 > 0 then yij = k.
k

• case 3: if zijk−1 < max{zijk } and zijk−1 > 0 then yij 6= 1 ∧ yij 6= k.
k

The MFA-MD model proposed here is related to the mixture of factor analyzers model
[20] which is appropriate when the observed data are continuous in nature. [14] detail a
Bayesian treatment of such a model; [36] detail a suite of parsimonious mixture of factor
analyzer models within a maximum likelihood framework.

Bayesian Model Estimation

A Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo is utilized for fitting the MFA-MD
model. Interest lies in inferring the underlying latent variables Z, the latent traits Θ, the
cluster membership vectors L and the model parameters i.e. the mixing proportions π, the
˜ g (∀g = 1, . . . , G) and the threshold parameters Γ.

4.1

Prior and Posterior Distributions

To fit the MFA-MD model in a Bayesian framework prior distributions are required for all
unknown parameters. As in [2], a uniform prior is specified for the threshold parameters.
Conjugate prior distributions are specified for the other model parameters:
˜ ) = MVN(q+1) (µ , Σλ )
p(λ
gd
λ

p(π) = Dirichlet(α)

In terms of latent variables, it is assumed the latent traits θi follow a standard multivariate
Gaussian distribution while the latent indicator variables, `i , follow a Multinomial(1, π)
distribution. Further, conditional on membership of cluster g, the latent variable z i |lig = 1 ∼
MVND (µg , Λg ΛTg + I). Combining these latent variable distributions and prior distributions
with the likelihood function specified in (3) results in the joint posterior distribution, from
which samples of the model parameters and latent variables are drawn using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling scheme.

4.2

Estimation via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling Scheme

As the marginal distributions of the model parameters cannot be obtained analytically a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme is employed. All parameters and
latent variables are sampled using Gibbs sampling, with the exception of the threshold
parameters Γ, which are sampled using a Metropolis-Hastings step.
The full conditional distributions for the latent variables and model parameters are detailed in what follows. Full derivations of the full conditional posterior distributions are
given in Appendix B.
• Allocation vectors:

The full conditional distribution for the underlying latent data Z follows a truncated Gaussian distribution. The point(s) of truncation depends on the nature of the corresponding
item and the observed response.

As a uniform prior is specified for the threshold parameters, the posterior full conditional
distribution of γ j is also uniform, facilitating the use of a Gibbs sampler. However, if
there are large numbers of observations in adjacent response categories very slow mixing
may be observed. If the threshold parameters are slow to converge this may result in slow
convergence of other parameters also. Thus, as in [10, 15, 29] a Metropolis-Hastings step is
used to sample the threshold parameters; the overall sampling scheme employed is therefore
a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler.
Briefly, the Metropolis-Hastings step involves proposing candidate values vj,k (for k =
(t−1)
2
2, . . . , Kj −1) for γj,k from the Gaussian distribution NT (γj,k , σM
H ) truncated to the interval
(t−1)

(t−1)

(vj,k−1 , γj,k+1 ) where γj,k+1 is the value of γj,k+1 sampled at iteration (t − 1). The threshold
vector γ j is set equal to the proposed vector, v j , with probability β = min(1, R) where R is
2
defined by (5) in Appendix B. The tuning parameter σM
H is selected to achieve appropriate
acceptance rates.
This Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling scheme is iterated until convergence, after which
the samples drawn are from the joint posterior distribution of all the model parameters and
latent variables of the MFA-MD model.

4.3

Model Identifiability

The MFA-MD model as described is not identifiable. One identifiability aspect of the model
concerns the threshold parameters. If a constant is added to the threshold parameters for
an ordinal item j and the same constant is added to the corresponding mean parameter(s),
the likelihood remains unchanged. Therefore, as outlined in Section 3.1, the second element
γj1 of the vector of threshold parameters, γ j , is fixed at 0 for all ordinal items j.
Another identifiability aspect of the model involves its factor analytic structure. Since
a factor analytic structure is imposed on the underlying latent data, the model is also rotationally invariant. Many approaches to this identifiability issue have been proposed in
the literature. A popular solution is that proposed by [19] where the loadings matrix is constrained such that the first q rows have a lower triangular form and the diagonal elements are
positive. This approach is adopted by [41] and [14] among others. However, this approach
enforces an ordering on the variables [1] which is not suitable under the MFA-MD model.
Here, the approach to identifying the MFA-MD model is based on that suggested by [25]
and [23] in relation to latent space models for network data. Instead of imposing a particular form on the loadings matrices the MCMC samples are post processed using Procrustean
methods. Each sampled Λg is rotated and/or reflected to match as closely as possible to a
reference loadings matrix. The latent traits, θi , are then subjected to the same transformation. The sample mean of these transformed values is then used to estimate the mean of the
posterior distribution.
Conditional on the cluster memberships on convergence of the MCMC chain, a factor
analysis model is fitted to the underlying latent data within each cluster. The estimated
loadings matrix obtained is used as the reference matrix for each cluster. Only the saved
MCMC samples need to be subjected to this transformation which is done post hoc and is
computationally cheap.

Results: fitting the MFA-MD model to the SES data

A number of models with G, the unknown number of clusters, ranging from 1 to 6 and q
the dimension of the latent trait ranging from 1 to 2, were fitted to the SES data. The 3
cluster solution with 1 dimensional latent trait which is discussed here was chosen for reasons
addressed in Section 5.3.

5.1

Results: Three Component MFA-MD model

The clustering resulting from fitting a 3 component MFA-MD model divides the households
into 3 distinct homogeneous subpopulations, with intuitive socio-economic characteristics.
The modal responses to items for which the modal response differed across groups are presented in Table 1. These statistics only tell part of the story however, and the distribution
of responses will be analyzed later.
It can be seen from Table 1 that cluster 1 is a modern/wealthy group of households. The
modal responses indicate that households in this cluster are most likely to possess modern
conveniences such as a stove, a fridge and also some luxury items such as a television.

ix

In contrast, cluster 3 is a less wealthy group. Households in this group are likely to have
poor sanitary facilities – the modal response to the location of toilet facilities and the type
of toilet are “bush” and “none” respectively. Households in cluster 3 are also less likely to
own modern conveniences such as a fridge or television.
The socio-economic status of cluster 2 is somewhere between that of the other two groups,
but closer to cluster 1 than 3. Households in cluster 2 are likely to have better sewage
facilities and larger dwellings than those in cluster 3 but lack some luxury assets such as a
video player. They are also likely to keep poultry and cook with wood rather than electricity
which suggests this group may be less modern than cluster 1 to some degree.
It is interesting to note that the largest group is the wealthy/modern cluster 1 while the
smallest group is cluster 3 who have the lowest living standards.

A more detailed picture of how the groups differ from each other is presented in Figures 1
and 2. Box plots of the MCMC samples of the cluster specific mean parameter µg are shown
in these figures. The box plots for the binary/ordinal items (Figure 1) have a different
interpretation to those for the nominal items (Figure 2). The binary and ordinal responses
have been coded with the convention that larger responses correspond to greater wealth.
Thus a higher mean value for the latent data corresponding to these items is indicative of
greater wealth. To interpret the box plots for the nominal items all latent dimensions for a
particular item must be considered. If the mean of one dimension (k, say) is greater than the
means of the others for a particular cluster, then the response corresponding to dimension k
is the most likely response within that cluster. If the means for all dimensions for a particular
item are less than 0 then the most likely response by households in that cluster is the first
choice.
The box plots corresponding to the binary and ordinal items are shown in Figure 1. The
elements of the mean of cluster 1 (the wealthy/modern cluster) µ1 can be seen to be greater
than those for the other clusters in general; this reflects the greater wealth observed in cluster
1 compared to the other groups. Similarly the elements of µ3 (the least wealthy group) are

in cluster 3. The difference between cluster 3 and clusters 1 and 2 is particularly stark on
the location of toilet facilities (ToiletFac) and the type of toilet facilities (ToiletType) items.
The means for clusters 1 and 2 are notably higher than the mean for cluster 3 since the
responses for groups 1 and 2 are typically a number of categories higher on these items.
Figure 2 shows box plots of the MCMC samples of the dimensions of the cluster mean
parameters, µg , corresponding to the nominal items. Focusing on the latent dimensions
corresponding to the PowerCook item, say, it can be seen that the highest mean for cluster
1 is on the ‘electricity’ dimension followed closely by the ‘wood’ dimension, and that these
means are greater than 0. This implies that the most likely response to the PowerCook
item for cluster 1 is electricity but that a significant proportion of the households in this
group cook with wood. The highest means for clusters 2 and 3 are on the ‘wood’ latent
dimension. Thus most of the households in these clusters cook with wood in contrast to
the wealthy/modern cluster 1. This difference is indicative of a socio-economic divide. In
a similar way, the mean parameters for the PowerLight item suggest that electricity is the
most likely source of power for lighting for households in all clusters; the parameter estimates
associated with the Roof item suggest corrugated iron roofs are the predominant roofing type
on dwellings in the Agincourt region.
To further investigate the difference between the 3 clusters the response probabilities
to individual survey items within a cluster are examined. For example Table 2 shows the
probability of observing each possible response to the Stove item, conditional on the members
of each cluster.

The distances between the cluster specific item response probability vectors can be used
to make pairwise comparisons of groups. The distance measure used here is Hellinger distance [3, 6, 42]. Suppose
P there exist two
Pmvectors of probabilities, a = (a1 , . . . , am ) and
b = (b1 , . . . , bm ), where m
a
=
1
and
i=1 i
i=1 bi = 1, then the Hellinger distance between a
and b is:
" m
#1
p 2 2
1 X √
H(a, b) = √
ai − b i
2 i=1
The Hellinger distance that may be achieved between 2 vectors of probabilities lies in [0, 1].
A distance of 1 is achieved if all the households in one cluster respond in one way while all
the households in the other cluster respond in another.
It should be noted however that there is more than one way in which a Hellinger distance
of 1 may be achieved if Kj > 2. This only causes a problem for ordinal items. For example,
in the case of an ordinal item with Kj = 4, a distance of 1 will be found if all the households
in one group respond with a 1 while all the households in the other group respond with a
4. However, a distance of 1 will also be achieved if all households in one group respond

with a 2 and all households in the other group respond with a 3. Since the question is
ordinal the distance in the former case should be larger than that in the latter case. This
is a shortcoming of the metric and will result in the underestimation of distances between
groups on ordinal items.
Pairwise comparisons between clusters are illustrated in Figure 3. The Hellinger distance
between response probability vectors for each item are plotted. The groups that are most
different are clusters 1 (the wealthy/modern cluster) and 3 (the least wealthy cluster). The
sum of the Hellinger distances between these groups across all items is 7.316. The items for
which the Hellinger distance between the response probability vectors is largest are ToiletType, ToiletFac, Stove and PowerLight, highlighting the areas in which households in these
clusters differ most. There are noteworthy Hellinger distances for many other items also.
The difference in response patterns for these items is also evident in the box plots in Figures 1
and 2.
The sum of the Hellinger distances between clusters 1 and 2 (the wealthier two clusters) across all items is 3.544 making these two groups the most similar. There are some
notable differences however; the Hellinger distance between the groups on the items Stove
and PowerCook are 0.501 and 0.556 respectively which accounts for almost 30% of the total
distance.
Clusters 2 and 3 are quite different and the sum of the Hellinger distances between these
groups is 5.643. As was the case for clusters 1 and 3 the items ToiletType and ToiletFac
provide the largest Hellinger distances between groups 2 and 3. In contrast however there are
much smaller differences for the items Stove and PowerCook. Again these results highlight
the specific areas in which the socio-economic status of households within each cluster differ.
A similar pattern was observed in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2.

5.2

Model Fit

In order to assess model fit we used a cross validation approach based on ideas originally
introduced by [50] and examined more recently by [40]. In the case of the SES data this
involves removing a portion of the data points (not households) at random across the data
matrix, then running the model and imputing these missing values based on the parameter
values at each iteration. The categorical values are imputed by simulating values for the
latent variable Z then using the decision rules explained in Section 3 to determine the
categorical value Y . This procedure is repeated until all data points have been removed
once. The percentage of correct imputations for each data point is used to assess how well
the model fits the data.
The three component, one-dimensional latent trait model performs very well with respect
to this criterion. The SES data was divided into 10 groups with each data point assigned
to one of the groups with equal probability. The model then ran 10 times, leaving out one
of the groups of data points each time. The mean percentage of correct imputations across
all data points was 0.78 and the median was 0.89 indicating that the three component, one
dimensional latent trait model is a good fit for the SES data.

5.3

Model Selection

There are two separate aspects to model selection for the MFA-MD model since both the
dimension of the latent trait, q, and the number of mixture components, G, must be chosen. Traditional likelihood based tools for model selection are not available here since the
likelihood is intractable.
The choice of q is addressed first. Models with the number of mixture components ranging
from 1 to 6 were fitted for both q equal to 1 and q equal to 2. Having fitted these models
it was found that both the clustering and the interpretation of the clusters were broadly
similar whether q was 1 or 2. The Rand index comparing clusterings with the same number
of components was typically about 0.75. However, adding an extra dimension to the latent
trait adds over 17, 500 extra parameters to the model since when q is 2 one extra dimension
of θi must be estimated for each household in the data set. The more parsimonious model
with a one dimensional latent trait was chosen as there was little to be gained from adding
an extra layer of complexity.
Having chosen the dimension of the latent trait it remains to choose the most appropriate number of mixture components. Clustering uncertainty is one model attribute which
helps choose G. A histogram of the clustering uncertainty of each household under the 3
component model is shown in Figure 4. It is clear to see that these values are very low in
general indicating that households are assigned to groups with a high degree of confidence.
Histograms for other numbers of components were quite similar. Although clustering uncertainty was low across all models the lowest median values were observed for the 2 and
3 component models. The median clustering uncertainty for these models were 0.009 and
0.011 respectively. The median value for the 4 component model was 0.039 and this value
increased as more components were added, this can be seen in Figure 4. The clustering
uncertainty for the 2 and 3 component models are virtually identical but the 3 component
model was favored since it provided a much more intuitive interpretation of the clusters.

Discussion

The MFA-MD model described in this paper successfully clusters households into groups of
differing socio-economic status. Which households are in each group and what differentiates
these clusters from each other can be examined in the model output. This information is
potentially of great benefit to various authorities in the Agincourt region. The interpretation
of these groups could aid decision making with regard to infrastructural development and
other social policy.
There are many other potential uses for the MFA-MD model. The cluster memberships
could be used for targeted sampling of a particular cluster with new questions taking into
account what is known about that group already. The clustering output from this model
could also be used as covariate input to other models such as mortality models. There may be
important differences in mortality rates in different socio-economic strata within the region.
New health policies may need to take these differences into account.
The MFA-MD model is also a novel model-based clustering approach to clustering mixed
categorical data. The SES data used here is a mix of binary, ordinal and nominal data. The
MFA-MD model provides clustering capabilities in the context of such mixed data without
mistreating any one data type. A factor analytic model is fitted to each group individually
which may be interpreted in the usual manner.
Future research directions are plentiful and varied. The lack of a formal model selection
criterion for the MFA-MD model is the most pressing, and challenging. Currently the model
relies on expert knowledge and some informative heuristics to choose the most appropriate
number of components. A formal criterion which selects the most appropriate number of
components and also the dimension of the latent trait would be very beneficial. Model
selection tools based on the marginal likelihood [17] are a natural approach to model selection
within the Bayesian paradigm; such approaches are potentially useful within the context of
the MFA-MD model, but the intractable likelihood poses difficulties. One potential future
avenue would be to approximate such model selection tools using the underlying latent data,
but this also brings difficulties.
Additionally, there are several ways in which MFA-MD model itself could be extended.
The data set analyzed here is survey data from a single time point. There have been several
waves of this particular survey – extending the MFA-MD model to appropriately model
longitudinal data would be beneficial. In this way households could be tracked across time
as they may or may not move between socio-economic strata. As with most clustering
models, the variables included in the model are potentially influential. The addition of
a variable selection method within the context of the MFA-MD model could significantly
improve clustering performance. A reduction in the number of variables would also decrease
the computational time required to fit such models. In a similar vein, the Metropolis-Hastings
step required to sample the threshold parameters in the current model fitting approach could
potentially be removed by using a rank likelihood approach – [24] details such an approach in
relation to ordinal regression. This could also offer an improvement in computational time.
Other areas of ongoing and future work include the inclusion of modeling continuous
data by the MFA-MD model. This would facilitate the clustering of mixed data consisting
of both continuous and categorical data [37], and requires little extension to the MFA-MD
model proposed here. Finally, covariate information could naturally be incorporated in the
xvii

MFA-MD model in the framework of a mixture of experts model [22, 28].
