EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!
RECONSTRUCTING THE DEMOCRATIC PEACE

CSSS WORKING PAPER 55
MICHAEL D. WARD, RANDOLPH M. SIVERSON, AND XUN CAO

Research in international politics may have produced misleading results
because (1) typical data contain dependencies that have been ignored, (2) populations are treated as samples, with unwarranted reliance on misleading significance
tests, and (3) scant attention is devoted to how well the model can predict the
events of interest. Using the democratic peace research program as an example, we
show that the three elements of the Kantian model-mutual democracy, high trade
and common membership in IGOs–have at best weak effects on dampening the occurrence of militarized international disputes within dyads. Neither do they offer
meaningful predictions about which dyads will be involved in these disputes. A
model incorporating several types of dependencies among countries yields results
with high levels of predictive accuracy and provides new substantive insight about
the prominence of dependencies in international relations.

Abstract.

In a recent paper, Frieden & Lake (2005) take stock of the state of research in international politics. Their overall argument is that “progress in the study of international politics–
including. . . making its lessons more relevant to policy–depends on more not less, rigorous theory
and, more not less, systematic empirical testing” (p. 137). While we agree with their overall sentiments, the argument we present here is that different modes of systematic empirical research are
needed to avoid problems that have had unrecognized consequences for the quality of the research
results reported in the literature.
In this paper we identify three major problems with prevailing practices in the empirical
analysis of international politics. These are (1) the lack of independence in the cases, (2) an
unwarranted reliance on tests of significance and, as a consequence (3) a neglect of how well a
“tested” model predicts the outcome of interest. The combination of these problems can produce
misleading results. We show in this article that because popular statistical procedures overlook the
dependencies in the data, they result in an over-confidence in the Kantian hypothesis that joint
democracy, mutual trade, and shared participation in the international governmental organizations
each independently reduce international conflict.

Three Problems

The first problem is that both dyadic data and international relations are known to contain dependencies that are omitted by most popular procedures for analyzing data.1 Because
regression-based approaches assume that the data are exchangeable and the errors independently
and identically distributed, they are unable to capture the extent to which dependent data may
actually reflect the ebb and flow of international politics. International Organization published a
symposium in 2001 that examined the robustness of statistical findings in many dyadic studies of
international conflict. Green, Kim & Loon (2001) surveyed more than four dozen panel studies in
the field of international relations that appeared in prominent scholarly journals over the period
from 1996-1999. They raised the question of whether the democratic peace is a powerful explanation, or whether dyad-based fixed effects were statistically more powerful. In summarizing this
debate, King (2001) noted that the thorniest problem is to unravel the dependencies in dyadic data
that result in biased estimates of coefficients and covariance structures, and further suggested that
“[a] logical methodological starting point for addressing the problems at hand would be based on
Bayesian hierarchical, random effects, or split population models” (page 506). Below we present
one such model to examine the role of dependencies in the democratic peace literature.2
What are these dependencies? Maoz (2004) has shown for example that countries which are
involved in conflicts in one decade are quite prone to them in the next. He illustrates that Sweden,
Switzerland, and Venezuela, for example, generally are not involved in militarized disputes and
wars, while historically, Israel, Pakistan, India, Jordan, and Syria (among others) are repeatedly
involved in both disputes and wars. These historical facts result in dependencies among the ebb
and flow of, as well as the data we collect on, interstate disputes and wars. These dependencies
are at the core of this research. They reflect the fact that it is common to observe patterns of
interstate conflict having the same initiator but different targets. For example, pursuing an active
foreign policy may lead a country into conflict with many different countries over time. Similarly,
disputes having different initiators but the same targets are also common, as in the case of the first
Gulf War where a large number of countries were engaged in conflict with Iraq. These actions are
at least partially dependent upon one another and can not be treated as completely independent
occurrences. Additional, there are often pairs of countries that are in repeated, or protracted,
conflicts that are typically described as rivalries (Diehl, Goertz & Jones 2005). Episodic conflicts
and disputes are not independent, either statistically or historically. The geopolitics of the Middle
East is replete with such dyadic dependencies. Table 3, below, displays some of the most prominent
dependencies in international conflict data.
A second important problem we address concerns the basic inferential model that dominates
popular practice in the field of international relations, as well as many other disciplines. Since most
research in international relations is based on observational studies that have a large number of
cases, there is an appearance of statistical significance in almost all the findings in the literature,
even considering the well-known publication bias for positive and statistically significant results.
Actually, the prevailing popular statistical approach reflects the ability of the tests to detect small
differences–i.e., the power of the tests–as well as the number of observations more than it reveals
any underlying statistical significance of hypothesized causal linkages (Savage 1957, Gill 1999). This
research tradition somehow expects more from tests of significance, an expectation that probably
creates more problems than it solves.

One early effort examined strategic dependencies in the context of endogenous choice calculus (Smith 1999). Another
important initiative (Signorino 1999) extends the Quantile Response Equilibrium in the context of a solution to certain
game-theoretic models of strategic choice.

Clark & Regan (2003) have examined split population models, examining heterogeneity in different samples, but not
examining dependencies.

While observational data rarely comprise a random sample, they nevertheless are frequently
treated as an enormous one. Large samples have immense statistical power that large collections
of observational data normally do not. The null hypothesis implicit in most of the statistical
examinations of these models is that the quantities of primary interest are all equal to zero. Why
this would be the case in observational data is not clear. In situations characterized by rare events
with a preponderance of non-occurrences, we should not expect the pooled correlations to be
identical for all groupings of observations. Zero correlation is a meaningful expectation if and only
if one knows that the two groups of cases (for example: the disputes and the non-disputes) are either
randomly assigned to the treatment (dispute) or randomly selected from the covering population
in such a way that they are matched on the important covariates. Neither of these conditions can
plausibly be argued to be the case for observational data on militarized interstate disputes, nor, for
that matter, in almost any data currently being used in the study of international politics. As a
result, statistical significance tests can be badly misleading in terms of producing information about
the underlying data generating processes by allowing scholars to attribute statistical significance
to summary characteristics known a priori to be different. Below we show that it is not necessary
to embrace the sampling framework in order to extract useful information from observational data
in the context of the democratic peace.
Third, most studies have focused solely on statistical significance as a measure of “fit,”
while at the same time avoiding evaluations of the in-sample fit of estimated model predictions
with actual data. Regression diagnostics are only one heuristic, not the terminus of scientific
investigation. Indeed, they can often be misleading. We show that a predictive heuristic helps
to protect scholars from making statistical inferences that may be problematic. The basic idea is
quite simple: a good model will not only have estimated coefficients that are informative, but it
also should accurately map the covariate information into the dependent variable. That is, the
model should accurately identify the observed patterns in the dependent variable. Because of the
misapplication of statistical significance in observational studies, it is possible that specifications
shown empirically to be “statistically significant” will be unable to identify patterns in the data
correctly.
We analyze the issues involved in incorporating higher-order dependencies into statistical
models of dyadic data and illustrate a two-faceted solution to this shortcoming of popular approaches. Our approach not only explicitly incorporates higher-order dependencies in a hierarchical
framework, but also relies on using predictions as a heuristic for model evaluation.
It is simple to predict the absence of conflict between pairs of countries, whether they are
democratic or not.3 This is easy because conflict itself, though enduring and ever present, is at the
same time relatively rare. Over the period from 1886-1992, for example, there are approximately
150,000 dyad-years in which two specific countries could have engaged in a militarized dispute with
one another, but this happened less than 1% of time. Ignoring all temporal, systemic, dyadic, or
country-specific information about what may cause militarized interstate disputes, a good guess is
that about 1% of the dyads may be involved in a dispute at any given point in time. So unconditional
on any additional information, the best guess is that any two countries will not be engaged in a
militarized interstate dispute during any year. This expectation is overwhelmingly correct, 99% of
the time. Such an observation is not especially helpful from a scientific point of view. It provides
no basis for either explaining or predicting which of the dyads will be involved in one of the rare
events.
3
Although, as Schrodt (2002) notes, actual predictions by scholars are quite rare. However, see his (forthcoming)
predictive results on the Balkans and Bueno de Mesquita’s volume on Predicting Politics (2002). Siverson (2000)
also discusses the value of prediction in the context of policy. Pevehouse & Goldstein (1999) is another example of
predictive work in international relations. Feder (1987) wrote an early piece on forecasting in the U.S. Intelligence
Community that has since been declassified. See Ward & Gleditsch (2002) as well as Beck, King & Zeng (2000) for
additional studies employing in-sample and out-of-sample predictions in international relations.

In undertaking this analysis, we aspire to add nuance to the growing literature on the
democratic peace by demonstrating that jointly democratic regimes do have a lower probability of
militarized dispute involvement, but that this probability is sufficiently low to be uninformative in a
predictive sense. In the research area known as the democratic peace scholars have made concerted
efforts to embrace these dependencies at the theoretical level, but have been less successful in
leveraging them in empirical analyses. Instead, we find that the dependencies among countries are
far more powerful in explaining the existence of militarized disputes among contemporary countries
than the factors identified in the Kantian model.
Democratic Peace
The standard model of the democratic peace examines the pacifying effects of trade, international organizations, and democracy upon the initiation and continuation of militarized interstate
disputes. There is a substantial and important scholarly literature largely built upon statistical
studies of observational data reporting the incidence of dyadic militarized interstate disputes and
wars in various periods since 1816. This literature has recently evolved from its roots in exploring
whether pairs of democratic countries have a reduced probability for war with one another (Maoz &
Abdolali 1989, Small & Singer 1976) into a continued and broader examination of the covariates of
militarized interstate disputes.4 Most empirical scholarly literature on this topic uses a regression
perspective, identifying those variables and factors thought to be more or less important in explaining the occurrence of militarized disputes, assessing by statistical significance the power of various
bivariate hypotheses concerning the democratic peace.5 This approach is, of course, wide-spread
and has been adopted by numerous research programs.
“The Kantian Peace” (Oneal & Russett 1999) is, in our opinion, the canonical study of
the democratic peace. It uses a general linear model to estimate the occurrence of militarized
interstate disputes over the period 1886-1992. Many other studies have employed these exact or
similar data along with various perturbations of the specified regression equation. The basic insight
of this line of research has been that democratization, international commerce, and participation in
international organizations are each shown to be independently pacifying forces in world politics.
Oneal & Russett (1999, page 33) summarize their work by noting that “. . . analyses for the years
1885-1992 indicate that Kant was substantially correct: democracy, economic interdependence, and
involvement in international organizations reduce the incidence of militarized interstate disputes.”
Similar declarations are by now legion in scholarly writing, and are also frequently found in the
policy pronouncements of the governments of industrialized democracies, among others.
Because the Oneal & Russett article, as well as the data and methods therein, are widely
referred to, we use it as a reference point to begin our analysis. Table 1 presents Oneal & Russett’s
statistical results. These results were obtained with a general estimating equation specified to take
into account the time-series and cross-sectional nature of the data.6 As in many other published
studies of this phenomenon, the accumulation of asterisks is substantial. Similar results are found
throughout the observational, empirical literature, and serve as part of the basis for the strength
standing behind the democratic peace idea.
Apart from a strong demonstration of statistical significance, how well do these kinds of
results capture the observed existence of the militarized interstate disputes? One way to answer this

Cederman (2001) and Cederman & Rao (2001) are examples of different approaches.
Oneal & Russett made not only their database available, but also their Stata program; accordingly, we have exactly
replicated their published results. We also replicated their statistical procedures using a different implementation
of the GEE estimator, this one found in the statistical package R; these results are essentially identical, and slight
numerical discrepancies are attributed to differences in the underlying scale parameters estimated by each of the two
algorithms.

question is to examine the number of correct and incorrect predictions that this model produces.
Put differently, we seek to move beyond the statistical significance associated with a particular
model and instead to explore how well it captures the occurrence of militarized interstate disputes.
Since the dependent variable is binary and the underlying model produces a probability
estimate, we need to establish an appropriate probability threshold (or cut-point) above which
a predicted probability will be coded as predicting the occurrence of a militarized dispute. By
convention many statistical studies use 0.5 as the threshold, as this value equalizes the cost of false
positives (predicting a militarized dispute in a dyad-year without such a dispute) and false negatives
(failing to predict an actual militarized dispute). In the case of militarized interstate disputes, a
ratio that equalizes these costs will not be sensible, since we know that 99% of the time there is no
militarized interstate dispute. Indeed, as shown in the top half of Table 2, if we use this threshold,
we will be unable to correctly identify any single instance of a militarized interstate dispute; the
model will always predict the absence of a dispute, irrespective of the values of the independent
variables. We chose a more reasonable alternative. The mean of the dependent variable is 0.009.
Employing this as a cut-point, how well does the model predict to actual militarized disputes in the
data?7 As shown in the bottom half of Table 2, because the cost of falsely predicting disputes is
low for this threshold, over 22,000 pairs of countries are predicted to be involved in disputes. To be
sure, about 80% of the MIDs are correctly identified, but at the cost of an overwhelming number
of false positives: 95% of the predicted disputes are actually non-disputes.
The states, dyads and years yielding the largest number of correctly predicted dispute
participation are shown in Table 3. Major powers are frequent members in the set of countries that
are correctly predicted to be involved in a militarized dispute. The United States is most frequently
correctly identified as being in a dispute (some 151 times), followed by the Soviet Union (139), the
7This value suggests that it is about 110 times more costly (to the decision maker using these results) to incorrectly
predict a militarized dispute than it is to predict a non-dispute when there is actually a dispute. It is important to remember that this is just an illustration. Decision theory requires that the cost assessments be obtained independently
of the actual data that are analyzed. However, we ignore this important requirement for didactic purposes. We chose
this small, extreme number to illustrate what assumptions are also necessary to obtain some correct predictions of
militarized interstate disputes using of this model.

column 1) replicated above it is impossible to predict accurately the occurrence and
non-occurrence of dyadic, militarized interstate disputes over the period from 1886

between disputes and the absence of a dispute.

unsurprising: the Soviet Union-Japan (35 instances), the US-Soviet Union (26), India-Pakistan
(27), Greece-Turkey (24), Soviet Union-China (23), and the UK-Soviet Union (21). The years
immediately preceding World War I and II account for over 20% of the correct predictions. Recent
predictions are also better, with an annual average of 19 disputes being correctly predicted in the
post-1938 period, compared to 8 in the pre-1939 era.
In short, this model is not informative beyond making a large number of false positive
predictions and suggesting that major and regional powers are more likely to be involved in disputes.
The results from the pooling procedure appear primarily to support an overconfidence based on
statistical significance that is not borne out in the accuracy of predictions. Moreover, the countries,
dyads, and years identified are not surprising and might have been identified a priori. Using the
residuals from this model yields results that appear to be astonishing. The Pearson residuals were
mapped into the set S{0, 1} such that large outliers were set to 1 and all others were assigned
a value of 0. Table 4 illustrates the results of using these recoded Pearson residuals to identify
militarized interstate disputes. The residuals actually contain all of the correct information about
the existence of dyadic, militarized interstate disputes. The converse is that the originally estimated
canonical model of the democratic peace contains virtually no information about the dependent

variable. Better in-sample predictions are produced by the residuals than are produced by the
model.8 Why? Since the model fits poorly, the residuals essentially recapture the dependent
variable. As a result they provide an overwhelmingly good fit to the dependent variable.
Few studies have examined the fit of the democratic peace idea, focusing instead on the
statistical properties of estimated coefficients thought to represent the insights of the democratic
peace. The message of the above exercise is that the in-sample, predictive power of the estimated
binomial model representing the democratic peace is low, while the predictive power of the errors
from that model is almost perfect. This should perhaps lead to the admonition that “more research
is needed.” If so, perhaps an additional admonition is that we should try to work beyond significance
testing on huge bodies of observational data and instead direct our attention to other approaches
that lend themselves to dealing with the kind of data that dominates quantitative international
relations scholarship.
A Bayesian, Hierarchical, Bilinear, Mixed Effects Model
Modeling Dependencies. As noted above, dyadic data in international relations are replete with
dependencies. For example, because states have relatively stable policies it is reasonable to expect
that data emanating from a single country are likely to be correlated, as are data directed to a
single country. Similarly, dyads are likely to have data correlated over time. The social relations
model introduced a method to decompose variance in such data into sender and receiver effects as
well as permit within-dyad correlations via the analysis of variance (ANOVA) protocol (Warner,
Kenny & Stoto 1979, Wong 1982).9 The idea of further decomposing the variance in the context of
dyadic data was further developed (Gill & Swartz 2001, Li & Loken 2002) to permit the statistical
analysis of normally distributed dyadic data using additive effects. These ideas have been extended
to a generalized linear model that incorporates third-order dependence via a bi-linear effect similar
in spirit to that first introduced by Gabriel (1998).
Dyadic data are almost always characterized by third-order dependencies known in the
social networking literature as transitivity, balance, and clustering (Wasserman & Faust 1994). By
8Oneal & Russett’s Table 2 suggests that the Kantian variables have substantial marginal effects on the occurrence

of international disputes. It is important to recognize that difference statistics–even when calculated correctly–do not
reflect the underlying base rates and as a result may be less informative than tabulations of in-sample predictions.

), a reported 36% decrease in disputes associated
When the base rate of international disputes is 0.009 (i.e., 149,373
with increasing democracy by one standard deviation reduces the rate to 0.006. More concretely, the difference
between these two effects is, of course, 0.003, which implies a decrease of about 4 disputes in the data set. When
looked at in this light, the changes attributed to the variables reported do not look quite so powerful. A change in
probability from 0.25 to 0.75 seems consequential, while one from 0.01 to 0.03 does not, especially if the costs of
reduction are substantial.
9In the context of transactions, the language of sender and receiver is clear. However, in the context of conflict, it
is more complicated, since many disputes are protracted and while initiators of episodes can often be specified, it is
over-simplistic to assign prime mover status to that country. In what follows, we use sender and receiver to represent
different sides of a dyadic relationship. Every country is a potential sender and a potential receiver. This sociomatrix
is square having all countries arrayed along the columns and rows. A country is the sender in a particular militarized
dispute if it is among that set of countries identified to have first taken militarized action, according to the MID data.

way of explanation, transitive relations among three actors implies that “a friend of a friend is a
friend,” for example; balance implies that if two actors behave similarly towards each other, then
they will behave similarly to other actors as well; clustering implies that sets of actors can be
described in which relations are positive among all actors in the set and negative with all actors
not in the set. An early use of this kind of clustering in the field of international relations can be
found in Bueno de Mesquita (1975). Early uses of balance and transitivity can be found in studies
employing graph theory such as Harary (1959, 1969), Brams (1968), and Zinnes (1967).
Using the social relations re-formulation to capture sender (initiator), receiver (target), and
higher-order dependencies in the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data, we explore a model
analogous to the original specification of Oneal & Russett. This model is analogous, but has two
distinct advantages. First, it permits the direct estimation of important dependencies in the dyadic
data. Second, because the model has a hierarchical format it is unnecessary to force non-dyadic
variables to have a dyadic character (or vice versa), an unfortunate practice that is widespread in
the empirical literature. Each partner to any particular interaction has associated covariates at
both the country and dyad level. The hierarchical specification allows relational as well as country
specific linkages to be coherently included in a single model. As a result of these advantages we
have been able to adopt a simple approach to measuring the three putative foundations of the
democratic peace: democracy, trade, and international organizations.
Dyadic variables (xi,j ) capture the pillars of the democratic peace: (1) joint governance
structures measured as the product of the polity score of sender and receiver, (2) the imports of
the sender from the receiver, and (3) the number of international organizations in which both are
members. Like most empirical studies, we also added a measure of the distance between pairs of
countries; we use the distance in kilometers between the capital cities. In the dyadic context, i
and j index the sending and receiving countries. For both sender and receiver, three country-level
covariates (xi ) capture the population, the economic size measured in terms of gross domestic
product, as well as the regime type of each country.10

unmeasured latent positions of each country in the militarized interstate dispute network. These
latent positions (ui and vj ) index the propensities for country pairs to have similar interaction
patterns toward other countries. The latent positions of two countries will be similar if countries
are responsive to one another or if they have similar response patterns involving other countries.
Latent similarity captures transitivity and balance, and reveals clustering. One strong benefit of
this specification is that in addition to the latent positions, four additional quantities of interest are
developed. Each reflects some aspect of the higher-order dependencies. Since we model the random
effects as being multivariate normal, we can estimate their covariance structure: σa2 is the variance
of the sender random effects and σb2 the variance of the receiver random effects. Additionally, the
covariance between these two components is given by σab . In a similar way, the covariance of the
errors across dyads, i.e., the covariance of the errors between ǫi,j and ǫj,i , can also be parameterized
as ρσǫ2 , allowing a specific measure of reciprocity to be estimated (ρ). In this simple way, higherorder dependencies are posited in four new quantities of interest that have been previously assumed
to be nonexistent or unimportant. For the first time, it is possible to estimate these quantities.11
Since it has been demonstrated that the empirical results for the democratic peace are
stronger since the end of the World War II (Gowa 1999, Box-Steffensmeier, Reiter & Zorn 2003),
we have focused on the last five decades, 1950-2000 and estimated this model for eleven years:
{1950, 1955, . . . , 1995, 2000}. Table 5 provides the “big table of numbers” for the Bayesian estimation of the hierarchical, bilinear random effects model for the year 2000, as an illustration of our
basic results.12 It is important to note that the 95% empirical credible limits for all the dyadic
variables representing the democratic peace argument include zero. Stated differently, the three
traditional explanatory variables that undergird the notion of a democratic peace do not have
strong, unambiguous empirical effects in the most recent year available for analysis. In most other
years however, the patterns are more supportive of the notion that higher levels of democracy tend
to reduce conflict probabilities. Figure 1 presents the boxplots for the posterior distributions of the
estimated coefficient for dyadic democracy in equation (1). This figure illustrates that in most years

While the interaction of democracy levels in pairs of countries has a modest impact on
reducing their conflict, the effects of trade and IGO membership are more mixed. Figure 2 illustrates this by presenting a boxplot of the yearly posterior distributions. As the figure shows,

co-membership in international organizations has varying impacts, occasionally actually appearing
to increase the probability of a militarized dispute between two countries. The results for IGOs
in Oneal and Russett are the weakest of the three Kantian variables, and are significant in their
main analysis only for politically relevant dyads. However, in a separate paper (Russett, Oneal &
Davis 1998) covering the years 1950 to 1985, IGOs are closely linked to reductions in conflict.

Trade, shown in Figure 3, also shows a very weak linkage to the probability of dispute
involvement. Since trade is measured in current dollars, each year has been scaled to permit
display on the same scale. Imports generally exert weak downward pressure on the probability
of dispute involvement, but this effect is often indistinguishable from zero. In 1955 and 1975 the
estimated coefficients have a posterior mean that is positive.

The results in Table 5 also demonstrate that the higher-order dependencies posited are
rampant in the data. These dependencies are represented, in part, by the common sender variance,
the sender-receiver covariance, and the common receiver variance. Each is large and important.
Taken together, these three components exert a much stronger influence on the probability of
a militarized dispute among pairs of countries than the standard covariates. Together they are
substantially larger than the error variance. It is also worth noting that the dyadic reciprocity in
this particular year is large, a result similar to the large autoregressive coefficients widely reported
in empirical literature on the democratic peace. The size of these components serves to underscore
the importance of dependencies in these dyadic data on militarized interstate disputes. These
results hold in all years.13
Figure 4 illustrates the country level posterior distributions for the level of democracy of the
non-initiating country in the MID. This has a slight, positive effect on the probability of involvement
in militarized interstate disputes, but this effect had declined over time to become almost negligible
in most recent years.14
Predicting Militarized Interstate Disputes. How well does this more elaborate model predict
militarized interstate disputes? Figure 5 displays the predicted probabilities for each of the 114
dyadic MIDs in 2000. The dyads arrayed along the x-axis. The data are sorted on the size of the
predicted probabilities. Black lines that overlay gray bars may be considered “correct” in-sample
predictions of specific dyadic militarized interstate dispute involvement. Since the underlying model
is a probability model, in some sense no predictions are “wrong” because even events with very
low probabilities happen occasionally. However, most analysts use cut points to assign predictive
success to such models. This graphic illustrates that choosing different cut point will affect the
number of correctly identified militarized disputes. It also shows that even with very high cut

points the model’s predictions will identify a large number of MIDs. Similar predictions (not
shown) using only the linear covariates and excluding the higher-order terms do not identify a
single MID correctly. Thus, the higher-order dependencies enable the model to correctly classify
63 out of 114 militarized interstate disputes (52%, for a cut point of 0.0048), accompanied by only
12 false positives.

We also provide predictions mirroring our earlier experiment with the Oneal & Russett
model in Table 6, which reflects data for a single year. Thirty-seven disputes are correctly identified
by our model using a cut-point of 0.50, with only six false positives. There is a substantial number
of false negatives (77). Using the ex post ante mean to determine the prediction threshold, 63

correct dyadic MID involvements are predicted, with 12 false positives and 51 false negatives. It
appears that model is making reasonable predictions, correctly identifying about one-half of the
observed disputes, accompanied by a relatively low rate of false predictions.15 Importantly, of the
75 predicted disputes about 85% are actual disputes.

Other years have much more modest predictive success. For example, in 1950 (shown
in Table 7) only a few militarized dispute involvements are correctly predicted. However, seven
disputes are correctly predicted out of a possible 36–almost 20%, accompanied by only three false
positives. Even in years that are sparse in the number of MID involvements, the model still performs
better than previous models. Table 8 illustrates the predictions of the model for every year using
the posterior mean for each year as the cut-point.

By way of summary, we observe that a bilinear, latent space approach allows more coherent
heuristics about models that are based on dyadic data. In particular, we learned that it is possible
to make new inferences about the democratic peace. Prime among these is that the democratic
peace tripod is shakier in some years than in others, and we need to understand better this temporal
fragility. It seems most solid in years in which scant conflict occurs, but worse in years in which
15The Brier score is a measure of the predictive accuracy of probability models in the context of binary data, and is

widely employed in weather forecasting (Brier 1950); it ranges between 0 and 1 with low scores representing better
performance. Since there are so many correctly predicted non-events, the Brier score approaches zero in all models
considered. The Brier score for the Oneal and Russett model discussed earlier is 0.009 for the entire period, and
0.007 for the period since 1949. The Brier scores for the current study average 0.003. A similar metric of “fit” is the
Proportional Reduction in Error, variously known as the PRE or λP statistic, which is an index of the association
between two nominal scales. Using 0.50 as the cut-point yields a PRE in 2000 of 0.27 and 0.45 when the cut-point
is set to the posterior mean of 0.0048.

there is a lot of conflict. Ideally a predictive model of conflict should be as strong when there are
more conflicts as when there are fewer.
We also learned that interaction dependencies abound in the existing data on the democratic
peace. Under the standard approach to the democratic peace, and, we suspect, many other problems
in international relations research, second- and third-order dependencies among the data overwhelm
the impacts of the standard covariates thought to explain why democracies do not fight one another.
This does not mean that empirical theories are incorrect, necessarily. It does mean that they are
incomplete if they fail to take into account these contextual dependencies. In particular, we must
recognize that countries have a character to their foreign policies that is broadly consistent, imposing
a correlation in their actions toward others. Often this is the result of coordination. For example,
Gerhard Schr¨oder and Jacques Chirac held informal bilateral dinners every six weeks over the past
several years, reportedly in part to coordinate their foreign policies in opposition to the United
States. Similarly, some countries elicit similar responses from many others, imposing a correlation
in their dyadic behavior patterns. These two new features of the social relations model are missing
from most models in international relations, even those that recognize consistent patterns within
dyads over time. These results also show that context is neither impossible to take into account
systematically, nor solely the domain of qualitative analysis.
Conclusion
Let us summarize briefly the results that emerge from our analysis. Our argument has
been that the empirical analysis in international relations has proceeded on the basis of (1) a false
assumptions that the cases we observe in international relations data sets are independent of each
other and are exchangeable, (2) tests of statistical significance that can be misleading about the
power of the theories being tested, and (3) a consequent neglect of how well a model’s results
actually match up to the world it is putatively explaining. As our analysis of the widely accepted
results of the democratic peace has shown, the use of pooled cross sectional time series does not
obviate these problems. The use of such techniques may indeed control some sources of variation
in the data, but what is missing is the recognition of the dependencies that pervade dyadic data
about international relations.

With respect to the dependencies in the data, we employed tools that embrace a standard
regression framework, but that also explicitly incorporate important dependencies between and
among states. It is apparent that the previously unobserved dependencies are of hugely greater
importance in explaining conflict than the variables typically associated with the Democratic Peace.
These dependencies between and among states show persistent large effects influencing the results
we obtain.
The tools we employed allowed us to make substantially improved assessments about the
effects of several hypothesized relationships as well as markedly better predictions about the occurrence of militarized interstate disputes. Prediction is a useful heuristic in pointing to the practical
as well as theoretical importance of empirical models. Scientists must usually choose among theories that purport to explain the same phenomena. Two of the criteria most often invoked in making
such judgements is the theory’s logical rigor and the results of empirical research. A logically coherent theory that does not allow scientists to predict meaningful patterns in the data is a theory
that should not generate much confidence among researchers.
In that spirit, our analysis should raise some skepticism about the robustness of the Democratic Peace. When dependencies are taken into account, the current results only weakly support
the existence of the democratic peace, in spite of the fact that we used data from a period when the
democratic peace is thought to be strongest. To be sure, shared democratic political institutions
in a dyad does reduce the probability of conflict, but the overall effect is modest. The idea that
shared memberships in intergovernmental institutions reduces conflict shows great variation over
time, and in recent years actually appears to have a modest positive effect. Finally, support is
virtually nonexistent for the idea that high levels of trade dampen conflict. Thus, two legs of the
Kantian tripod, as it is termed by Russett, Oneal and Davis (1998), are broken and one is weak.

A.1.1. GDP. Data on the annual Gross Domestic Product were taken from Kristian Skrede Gleditsch’s “Expanded Trade and GDP Data, version 4.1” (2002). These data in 1999 US dollars are
available at weber.ucsd.edu/∼kgledits/exptradegdp.html.
A.1.2. Democracy and Autocracy. We use the annualized polity score (called Polity2), which ranges
from -10 for highly authoritarian states to +10 for highly democratic societies, to gauge the domestic
institutions in each country. These data are available from http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/
polity/, with registration. Some of these data were updated with information on so-called “microstates” from the separate database maintained at the University of California at San Diego by
Kristian Skrede Gleditsch (2003) Modified Polity P4 and P4D Data, Version 1.0., available at
weber.ucsd.edu/∼kgledits/Polity.html.
A.1.3. Population Data. Data on population were taken from Kristian Skrede Gleditsch’s population data archive, “Expanded Population Data,” University of Essex.
A.2. Dyadic Data.
A.2.1. Militarized Interstate Disputes. We employed the Militarized Interstate Disputes database
(version 3.02) which is maintained by Faten Ghosn and D. Scott Bennett, and described in Codebook for the Dyadic Militarized Interstate Incident Data, Version 3.0, 2003. These data and the
documentation are available at http://cow2.la.psu.edu/. The dependent variable in this study
is the existence of a militarized dispute between any two pairs of countries in a given year, coded
as a 1. Senders are those countries designated by the MID data to have first initiated action.
A.2.2. Dyadic Democracy. The product of the polity score for any given pair of countries defines
the jointly democratic characteristics of regime types in the two countries.
A.2.3. Trade. Imports were taken from Kristian Skrede Gleditsch’s “Expanded Trade and GDP
Data, version 4.1” (2002). These data are available at weber.ucsd.edu/∼kgledits/exptradegdp.
html. The trade data are used in billions of current year US dollars.
A.2.4. International Organizations. We used the IGO data on international governmental organizations with at least three independent states as members (Version 2.1) maintained by Jon Pevehouse
and Timothy Nordstrom and described in Jon Pevehouse, Timothy Nordstrom, and Kevin Warnke,
“Intergovernmental Organizations, 1815-2000: A New Correlates of War Data Set, 2003.” These
data are at http://cow2.la.psu.edu/.
A.2.5. Distance. Distance was calculated using the Haversine formula with data on latitude and
longitude of capital cities taken from the world.cities database maintained as part of the maps
package in the R statistical programming package. These are available from cran.r-project.org.
Distance was calculated in 1000s of Kilometers.
A.3. Countries Analyzed. We used all the data available to us for each year, which resulted
