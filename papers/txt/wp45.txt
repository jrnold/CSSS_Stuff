Abstract
We examine a standard, gravity model of international commerce, augmented to include political as well as institutional influences on bilateral trade. Using annual data from 1980-2001,
we estimate regression coefficients and residual dependencies using a hierarchy of models in
each year. Rather than gauge the generalizability of these patterns via traditional measures
of statistical significance such as p-values, we develop and employ a strategy to evaluate their
out-of-sample predictive strength. Our analysis of recent international commerce shows that
in addition to a typical gravity-model specification, political and institutional variables are
important. We show that the often reported link between international conflict and bilateral
trade is elusive, and inclusion of conflict in a model for trade can lead to over-fitting. Further, we show that there are substantial, persistent residual exporter-and importer-specific
effects, and that ignoring such patterns in dyadic trade data results in an incomplete picture
of international commerce, even in the context of a well-established framework such as the
gravity model.

Introduction

According to the World Trade Organization, the volume of imports in 2003 was over $9
trillion and will grow by approximately 25% by the end of 2005 .1 With the current downturn
in Europe and the recalibration of the U.S. dollar, the most recent expansion of world
trade is primarily a result of the expansion of economic activity in the industrializing world,
notably China, which is estimated to account for as much as one-fifth of the increase in global
exports.2 Macroeconomic theory and considerable policy analysis suggest that elimination
of global trade barriers would benefit rich and poor countries alike. One widely cited study
of the World Bank has suggested that a comprehensive elimination of global trade barriers
could lift 300 million people out of poverty and result in an income gain of as much as
$539 billion for developing countries and about $293 billion for the industrialized world
(World Bank 2002). The 2001 Doha World Trade Organization Ministerial suggested that
trade was the engine of growth, development, and employment over the past five decades
and seeks to leverage that impact to promote economic development and alleviate poverty
in the industrializing world.3 However, the Doha round multilateral negotiations are still
underway as of the end of 2004, having been resuscitated after many months on life support.
The fact that there are still considerable discussions of what could be achieved if there were
free trade underscores the obvious point that actual patterns of international commerce are
very far away from a theoretical ideal.
A snapshot of global economic activity in 2002 is presented in Figure 1. These maps show
each country with a mass approximately equal to its proportional share of global exports
and gross domestic product, respectively.4 While the bulk of the global labor force resides
in Asia, where India alone has a greater population that the continent of Africa, Part (a)
of this map illustrates that most exports emanate the United States and Western Europe,
not from the part of the world with the largest labor force. Indeed the total exports of
France and Germany are approximately equal to the US total. Frame (b) shows that the
United States has a much larger domestic economy than any other single country and most
continents, while western Europe has the a large critical mass as well. Africa, on the other
hand, is virtually missing from the global economic picture, a fact reflected in its atrophied
shape on these maps. A line drawn on the maps at the Equator would emphasize the the
economic vitality of countries in the Northern hemisphere, compared to those in the South.
Analytically, there seems little argument that–in principle–freer trade will result in an
expansion of economic activity that is likely to benefit many. Empirically, there is ample
evidence that international trade is also distributed in a suboptimal fashion. Consequently,
it is important to examine how international trade is typically understood and modeled. For
over four decades the gravity model has been used to describe international trade.5 The
basic idea behind a this model of international commerce is that the flow of goods and
services between two locale is proportional to the combined “mass” of the two locale. Such
an approach is one way of specifying a frictionless model of “free trade.”6 Indeed, the gravity

equalize their area based on the density of the attribute examined. Data in these maps were
primarily taken from the online edition of the World Bank’s World Development Indicators

or from the online edition of the CIA World Factbook. Coloring of maps is keyed to the
21-point Autocracy-Democracy Scale taken from the Polity IV project, with brown tones representing more authoritarian ruling structures and blue presenting variation in more democratic regimes. Dark brown represents countries (Afghanistan, Somalia, Sierra Leone, the
West Bank, and Western Sahara) that are in crisis or transition and can not be coded on
the underlying Autocracy-Democracy scale. The standard non-cartogram projection appears,
for comparison purposes, in the second row of this display.

model specification represents the state-of-the-art in international trade models, especially
since it is derivable from first principles (Anderson 1979), easy to assess statistically, and can
be modified to include a large variety of additional influences which may perturb international
commerce.7
A gravity model can typically explain about one-half the variation in bilateral international commerce and is considered as a benchmark of sorts. However, few political economists
believe that international commerce occurs within a free-trade system, absent the friction
and lubrication created by individuals, firms, and institutions. Figure 1 illustrates that the
global relationship of supply and demand is not transparent. As a result, many scholars
have introduced into the gravity model a variety of factors thought to increase or decrease
Bergstrand 1985). Deardorff (1998) illustrated that under certain conditions a model of transportation costs
will result in a gravity model specification, even under the basic assumptions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.
7
Some studies that employ various types of gravity specifications include Anderson (1979), Pollins (1989b),
Pollins (1989a), Deardorff & Stern (1990), Maskus & Ramazani (1993), Oguledo & MacPhee (1994), Deardorff (1998), Deardorff & Stern (1998), Bliss & Russett (1998), Barbieri & Schneider (1999), Gartzke, Li &
Boehmer (2001), Anderson & Marcouiller (2002), Anderson & van Wincoop (2003), Goenner (2003), and
Goenner (2004).

the bilateral flow of goods and services. Following the pioneering works of Oliver Williamson
(1985) and Douglass North (1990), scholars have focused on a wide variety of international
as well as domestic institutions that affect the bilateral level of commerce. Typically, these
institutions are those that are thought to provide accountable, stable, corruption free, and
effective governance, especially in so far as they provide an enforceable legal framework.
Recent work by De Groot et alia summarizes the general findings of this line of scholarly
research:
We find that institutional quality has a significant, positive and substantial impact on bilateral trade flows. The same goes for similar quality of governance.
These results support the hypothesis that institutional variation is an important
determinant of informal barriers to trade. The positive correlation between income per capita and quality of institutions gives rise to an explanation of why
high-income countries trade disproportionately amongst each other, while the
same does not hold for low-income countries. Generally good governance lowers the transaction costs for trade between high-income countries, while trade
between low-income countries suffers from high insecurity and transaction costs.
(De Groot et alia, 2004, page 119)
There is also long standing interest in whether international commerce is related to
international conflict. Perhaps one of the most influential, modern works in this vein was
Albert Hirshman’s 1945 study of the explicit use of trade by an imperialistic Germany during
the third Reich (Hirschman 1945/1980). Economic activities are seen not only as a substitute
for, but also a complement to, military conquest. More recent attempts to specify the link
between trade and national policy have also been controversial. Barbieri & Schneider (1999)
summarize no fewer than seventeen studies of the influence of trade on conflict. A more recent
summary of this literature can also be found in Mansfield & Pollins (2003). Unfortunately
there is no consensus, though most studies affirm the early findings that trade promotes
cooperation and reduces conflict. The earliest version of the argument is that since trade is
beneficial to both parties by definition, each will be reluctant to engage in conflict that would
disrupt the flow of rents accruing to the trade (Polachek 1980, Polachek 1992, Polachek 1997,
Polachek, Robst & Chang 1999). Pollins (1989b) suggests that “an importer’s consumption
satisfaction is influenced not only by the quantity of goods purchased, but by the general
friendliness or hostility of its political relationship with individual exporters” (page 469).8
Bliss and Russett (1998) argue that private actors in democratic states will prefer commerce with partners also in democratic states because democracies rarely go to war with
one another and the attendant risk ratio of having business interrupted by international
conflict is very low. Since democratic societies are viewed as less threatening in the foreign policy domain, international commerce with partners in democratic societies will rarely
be viewed as threatening national security. Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorf (2000) have
suggested that because governments are subject to domestic pressures in developing trade
policies, democratic countries are more likely to agree to liberalizing trade agreements than
non-democratic countries. Consequently, democratic countries will also trade more with one
another. Morrow, Siverson, and Tabares (1999) also show that pairs of countries both of
which are democratic trade more with one another. However, the role of mass based domestic politics in poor, authoritarian countries is unclear. Countries in militarized disputes are
widely thought to have a slight tendency to trade less with one another.
Despite the growing tensions between France and the United States, the level of bilateral

commerce is at an all time high, about $50 billion in 2002.9 Indeed it is estimated that about
1$ billion in trade and investments flows between the United States and countries in the EU
on a daily basis. The acceleration of trade disputes between Europe and the United States
in the 2003-2004 period does overlap in time with greater tensions between some parts of
Europe and the United States over conflict in the Middle East. However, one difficulty in
observing a trade–conflict link is simply that regions of the world with a large trading profile
are often also peaceful.
There are good examples of how conflict may suppress trade at the extremes. India and
Pakistan have a recurring, ongoing, unresolved international conflict that has endured since
shortly after Indian independence, over five decades ago. This conflict is attributed to having
stunted what should have been productive and extensive bilateral commerce between these
two countries. For example, India exports about $200 million to Pakistan on an annual basis,
less than one percent of its total trade volume. Similarly, Pakistan exports less than $100
million to India, out of almost $10 billion in annual trade. Immediately after independence,
India accounted for approximately one-half of Pakistan’s trade. Despite MFN status of
Pakistan imports in India, there is a de facto ban on imported Pakistani goods and services.
The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry (http://dgft.delhi.nic.in/) reports $38
million in imports from Pakistan over the period from 4/2004-6/2004. To date, Pakistan
has not granted WTO rights or MFN status to Indian goods. It is reported, however, that
as much as $2 billion in informal trade (via third parties such as Dubai) flows between India
and Pakistan.
Cooperation can, at the same time, be viewed as conflict. The prospect of recently agreed
to Chinese-ASEAN free trade policies is perceived to be very far away from “free trade” by
the U.S., European, and other non-Asian trade partners of the rapidly growing Chinese
economy. Increased trade among ASEAN countries has come at the putative expense of
Chinese trade with the west, especially the U.S. While Singapore trade with China grew
$10B from 2001-3, U.S. exports to Singapore were stagnant over the same period. The U.S.,
European, and Australian trade officials have complained bitterly about this new form of
trade cooperation (Gordon 2004).
Some studies have found that trade may actually promote conflict, or at best does not
move very much during severe international disputes among trading partners. This would
result in a positive association between these two phenomena. For example, Gowa (1994)
suggests that trade will generate conflict if states are pursuing policies to extract asymmetric
gains. Barbieri (1996) finds that in some circumstances trade will not be diminished in the
face of conflict among trading partners. There are good arguments to explain contradictory
evidence: trade could promote conflicts in some contexts by and suppress them in others by
providing a costly signal to potential conflict partners (Morrow 1999). Some work has now
begun to examine simultaneous models of conflict and trade (Reuveny & Kang 2003, Keshk,
Pollins & Reuveny 2004).10
Gravity models encompass economic factors at the domestic as well as international
level, while at the same time embracing political and institutional aspects that may impinge
bilateral commerce. However, they suffer from one essential problem. Despite their prominence and utility over the past four decades to study the flow of goods from one country to
another, statistical implementations of gravity models have misspecified the flow of goods
9

See http://stat.wto.org/CountryProfile/WSDBCountryPFView.aspx?Language=E&Country=IN.
The gravity model also played a minor role in the dispute over fixed effects in international relations
models. Green, Kim & Loon (2001) utilized a gravity model with fixed dyadic effects. This yielded a negative
link between democracy and trade, opposite what was found when fixed effects were excluded. Beck & Katz
(2001) suggested the this was largely due to mis-specification of the dynamics, not the fixed effects.

among countries, often by a lot.11 One main reason is that the typical model specification
assumes that the residuals from any linear model of trade flow are assumed to be “patternless”, or statistically independent and identically distributed. This is implausible, since it
assumes that there is no correlation of trade flows having the same source, nor any correlation of flows having the same destination. Given the asymmetry of international commerce
in which a few states account for a large share of international commerce (as shown in Figure 1), such an assumption is untenable. Such correlation calls into question the validity of
any p-values or standard errors associated with regression coefficients. In fact, even in the
absence of statistical correlation one might question the use of sampling-theory measures of
significance for such trade data, as these data are not random samples from a population,
nor do they involve a random assignment of regressor variables to a set of experimental units.
We suggest an alternative evaluation of gravity models in which
(a) residual statistical dependencies in trade involving a common exporter or importer are
estimated via latent additive and multiplicative effects, and
(b) the generalizability of regression and latent effects are evaluated by a type of out-ofsample predictive performance, which we refer to as temporal persistence.
The former builds on work on the bilinear random effects model developed earlier (Hoff 2003,
Hoff 2005, Hoff, Raftery & Handcock 2002, Hoff & Ward 2004) while the latter provides a reevaluation of the the potential impact of institutional context and conflict patterns on trade,
and gives a description of international commerce that exposes many heretofore hidden
dependencies in trade data. This should assist us in developing a clearer, more complete
picture of the evolution of bilateral trade in the contemporary world.
The next section describes the standard gravity model of trade, and the third section
outlines the main data analysis techniques using data from 1981. In Section 4 we analyze
each years’ trade data separately, and evaluate the generalizability of estimated effects based
on their ability to predict trade from one year to the next. Section 5 summarizes the results
and discusses alternative analysis methods. An appendix describes in detail the data and
software used for the analyses.

The Gravity Model of International Commerce

Sir Isaac Newton developed the first gravity model when he noted in Philosophiae Naturalis
Principia Mathematica (1687) that “Every object in the Universe attracts every other object
with a force directed along the line of centers for the two objects that is proportional to the
product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the separation between
the two objects.” That is, the gravitational force between two objects i and j, given their
masses Mi , Mj and the distance Di,j between them, can be expressed as:
Fi,j ∝

Mi × Mj
.
2
Di,j

The gravity model for international trade can be conceptualized analogously: Given some
definition of the “economic mass” of each country, some additional “gravitational” influences
11

McCallum (1995) found that borders between the United States and Canada were associated with a huge
distortion in U.S. commerce with Canada: trade among provinces was 22 times larger than trade between
provinces and states. This was called the paradox of the missing trade, especially since there are few formal
barriers to commerce across this border.

Zi,j and a measure of multiplicative error (eǫ ), a multiplicative model for trade flow between
countries i and j is
Fi,j ∝

β4
Miβ1 × Mjβ2 × Zi,j
× eǫi,j
−β3

.

Taking logarithms reveals the standard linear form of the gravity model typically employed
in statistical studies of bilateral trade:
= β0 + β1 ln Mi + β2 ln Mj + β3 ln Di,j + β4 ln Zi,j +ǫi,j
ln F
|
{z
} | {z } | {z }
| {zi,j}
bilateral trade =
mass
distance
other forces
where, making the analogy with Newton’s law of gravitation, we expect β1 > 0, β2 > 0 and
β3 < 0.
Such models for trade are widely employed and have typically been evaluated using
confidence intervals and p-values for the regression parameters, obtained using ordinary leastsquares regression and assuming the error terms are independent and identically distributed.
In particular, they assume:


E(ǫi,j × ǫj,i )
0 = E(ǫi,j × ǫi,k )


E(ǫi,j × ǫk,j ),

meaning that the correlation of residual trade flow between two countries is zero, and that
the correlation of exports and the correlation of imports from a given country are also both
zero. In the context of international trade, it is dubious that these assumptions are valid.
There is good reason to expect that a wide range of countries will import certain goods from
specific, large exporters. It is also to be expected that many countries will export to specific,
large importers. Finally, we may expect that if a country has certain trade agreements with
another then they will have both large residual exports to and imports from that country.
Thus, there should be a large amount of residual dependence that is attributable to the
sender, the receiver, and the dyad that the standard formulation ignores. We explore this
in the context of a single years’ data in the next section, and over a twenty year period in
Section 4.

Analysis of 1981 Data

We begin with a descriptive analysis of the 1981 trade data using the following linear model:
ln Fi,j = β0 + β1 log Gi + β2 log Gj + β3 log Di,j +
β4 Pi + β5 Pj + β6 Pi × Pj + β7 Ci,j + ǫi,j

(1)

where Fi,j portray the annual exports of country i to country j, Gi is the gross domestic
product of country i, Di,j is the distance from the capital of i to the capital of j, Pi is the
polity score of country i, and Ci,j measures the amount of cooperation between i and j in
conflictual international disputes. Details on the data employed are provided in Appendix
A. The basic substantive motivation of this model is that the flow of trade between two
countries is log proportional to the size of their individual economic outputs (Gi , Gj ) and
to their geographic distance from one another (Di,j ). Additionally, it is generally hypothesized that countries with developed democratic institutions (large values of Pi ) will not
6

only export more goods, but will also import more as well. Further, countries with similar institutional environments which are “jointly” democratic or autocratic (large values of
Pi × Pj ) are expected to have a tendency to trade more with one another. Finally, following
the literature, it is generally hypothesized that countries that are cooperative in militarized
interstate disputes (large values of Ci,j ) will trade more with one another, while those in
conflicts will tend to trade less with each other. This representation of log trade in terms of
linear combinations of explanatory variables falls into the class of standard gravity models of
international commerce, though individual variable choices may differ slightly (for example,
Morrow, Siverson & Tabares 1999, de Groot, Linders, Rietveld & Subramanian 2004).

Table 1 presents estimated parameters, nominal standard errors, and bivariate correlations between trade and the explanatory variables in Equation 1. The signs on the coefficients
for GDP and distance are as expected, indicating positive relationships between trade and
GDP and trade and proximity. There is also a positive relationship between trade and the
polity score of both the exporter and importer. The relationships between trade and the
remaining two variables is less clear. The correlations between these variables and trade
ˆ
are relatively small and have signs opposite the corresponding partial correlations (or β’s).
This is partly explained by the correlation between log distance and cooperation (0.097) and
between log distance and similarity of regime type (-0.098). With log distance removed from
the model, the signs of the regression coefficients for these two variables match those of their
correlation with log trade.
As described in (Hoff & Ward 2004), the residuals obtained from analyses of dyadic data
such as these often display a large amount of structure. Each country in the 1981 database
is represented many times, as an exporter as well as an importer. This suggests examining
the residuals from the above model with the following “row and column effects” model
ǫˆi,j = ai + bj + γi,j ,

(2)

where i and j range over the indices of the countries. This fits an additive exporter effect
ai and an importer effect bi for each country i in the database. Fitted values for these
coefficients are shown in Figure 3. The results indicate that in 1981 countries such as
Singapore, Paraguay, Sri Lanka and South Korea exported more than other countries having
similar explanatory variables, whereas Nigeria, Niger, Algeria, and Oman exported less. In
terms of imports, Singapore and the Netherlands imported more and Turkey, Nigeria and
Peru less than would be expected under the model specified by Equation 1 and given their
covariates.

Are these effects large compared to the error in the model? If the residuals ǫi,j were really
uncorrelated as standard analyses of gravity models typically presume, then the distribution
of these effects should be roughly normally distributed with mean zero and variance approximately equal to σ
ˆ 2 /(n − 1) = 4.8112 /80 = 0.29. If this were the case, we would expect to
see only 5% of the estimated effects outside of -1 and 1. However, we observe more than
50 percent of the effects outside of this bound, indicating there is a substantial amount of
structure in the data that is unexplained by Equation (1).
Finally, dyadic data such as these often display higher order patterns such as balance,
transitivity and clustering (Hoff, Raftery & Handcock 2002, Hoff & Ward 2004). Some
aspects of these patterns can be represented with latent, multiplicative effects (Hoff 2005)
that are similar to bi-plots (Gabriel 1971, Gabriel 1978, Bradu & Gabriel 1978) and other
matrix representation methods. We represent the residuals from Equation (2) as equal
to the inner product of exporter and importer-specific vectors of latent attributes, plus a
disturbance term:
γˆi,j = u′i vj + δi,j
(3)

The inner product u′i vj can be thought of as a reduced-rank interaction term, decomposed
into exporter and importer components. For now, we fit ui and vj as each being of length
two. A method for selecting the dimension of these vectors is discussed in the next section,
and details for obtaining least-squares estimates of ui and vj are discussed in Appendix B.
These multiplicative effects are presented graphically in Figure 3, where the plotting colors
for the countries are based on geographic locations, with nearby countries being of similar

color.

The interpretation of the fitted values of ui and vj is that if country i exports more to
country j than predicted by the gravity model and after controlling for the additive importer
and exporter effects in Equation (2), then the vectors ui and vj will have a similar direction.
For example, note that many OECD countries are in the middle right-hand side of the plot of
u (exporter) vectors, whereas they are on the opposite side of the v plot, suggesting that the
gravity model drastically over predicts the amount of trade among this set of countries. This
phenomenon can be explored further by noting that the residuals from Equation (2) between
pairs of OECD countries tend to be negative. Overall, these inner product representations
show considerable clustering of countries by geography. In particular the European countries
tend to group together, as do Middle Eastern countries and South American countries. This
is remarkable, especially given that geographic distance is already included explicitly in the
gravity model.

Persistence of effects and change over time

One goal of statistical inference is to make general conclusions based on specific data. With
this in mind, it would be desirable to know which patterns in the 1981 trade data generalize
to other years, and which patterns change substantially over time. We initially examine
the change over time by fitting Equation (1) to trade data from 1981 to 2000 for each year
separately. Year-specific least-squares regression parameters are shown in Figure 4.
Note that the variables in the standard gravity model (distance and GDP) all fluctuate
around values that are far from zero, compared to their variance across years. In contrast,
the coefficients for polity and cooperation fluctuate near zero, some even changing sign over
the course of the 20 year period. The figure indicates substantial correlation of regression
coefficients over time, also indicated in Table 2. This correlation is not too surprising, as we

9

would expect the mechanisms underlying trade to not change too drastically from one year
to the next.
ˆ
The red bands in the figure indicate nominal 95% confidence intervals (βˆ ± 2 × se[β])
ˆ is the standard error of the coefficient βˆ as
for each parameter in each year, where se[β]
estimated from the ordinary regression analysis. Each blue band corresponds to aqnominal
¯
95% confidence interval for the “population” mean value of each parameter (βˆ ±2× s2βˆ/20),
¯
where βˆ is the sample mean and s2βˆ the sample variance of the twenty estimated regression
coefficients βˆ1981 , . . . , βˆ2000 for a given regressor variable. Interpretation of such estimates
and confidence intervals has typically not been descriptive, but as providing the basis for
statistical inference and tests of hypotheses. For example, the nominal confidence intervals
from the 1981 analysis suggests that all explanatory variables are significantly different from
zero at level α = 0.05. Traditionally, such a result would be interpreted as meaning that
the nonzero relationships between trade and explanatory variables in 1981 are generalizable
to some larger super-population of trade data. However, the fact that roughly 25% of the
year-specific confidence intervals lie outside the blue intervals makes one wonder to what
putative super-population the significant results from any given year generalize?
As we see it there are at least two problems with the analysis of trade data using a
hypothesis testing approach applied to ordinary least-squares regression models. One is that
the analysis assumes that all the observations are independent, an assumption that can not
in principle be correct since individual countries are included many times in the data, both as
exporters and as importers. The second is that these analyses generally use all available data
in a given year or set of years, calling into question any measure of parameter salience based
on statistical sampling theory: The theory behind a confidence interval is that, in repeated
experiments or random samples from a population, a 95% confidence interval will cover the
true parameter value 95% of the time. In contrast, our analyses use the complete data from
each year under study, and so in a sense the parameter estimates provide the “true” measure
of the linear relationship between trade and the explanatory variables within a year. As
such, the value of a regression coefficient is never actually zero, and regression coefficients
from two different years are never exactly the same. With this in mind, hypothesis tests
of the form H0 : β = 0 or H0 : β1980 = β1981 are neither useful as measures of the salience
of certain variables, nor as measures of the amount of change in them over time. To quote
Savage (1957), “Null hypotheses of no difference are usually known to be false before the
data are collected; when they are, the rejection or acceptance simply reflects the size of the
sample and the power of the test, and is not a contribution to science.” In the analysis of
a single year’s data with 100 countries there will be about 10, 000 observations, and so it is
not surprising that using a hypothesis testing approach leads to the declaration that almost
all of the estimated parameters are statistically significant.

4.1

Predictive persistence of covariates via out-of-sample prediction

We suggest an alternative measure of the explanatory power and temporal persistence of a
variable or set of variables, based on out-of-sample predictive performance. Measuring such
performance is a standard method of model validation in which one subset of a database
(the training set) is used to estimate parameters in a model and a separate subset (the test
set) is used to evaluate the model. Roughly speaking, a model is “validated” if the model
estimated using the training set provides reasonable predicted values for the test set. Such
an approach is also often used for variable selection in regression models. Suppose we want

to decide whether or not to choose between two regression models: Model 1: E[yi ] = β1′ x1,i
and Model 2: E[yi ] = β1′ x1,i + β2′ x2,i . In effect, we are trying to decide whether or not to
include x2 as an explanatory variable. Using only observations from the training set, we can
obtain regression coefficients βˆ(1),1 via model 1 and βˆ(2),1 , βˆ(2),2 via model 2. The two models
can then be evaluated in terms of how well they predict the test data:

ˆ
i∈test (yi − β(1),1 xi,1 )
If the sum were taken over the training set then the ratio would always be greater than one,
as including an additional term in the model always improves the residual sum-of-squares.
In contrast, by summing over the test data, if x2 offers little explanatory power, or the
relationship between x2 and y is substantially different in the test and training data, then
the above statistic could be less than 1. This method of comparison is independent of the
number of parameters in the models being compared.
In many applications the training set is a random sample from an available database
and the test set is its complement. In this case, the model validation procedure is called
cross-validation, and the goal (besides prediction) is in some sense is to identify a model that
generalizes across random subsets of the data. In contrast, our goal is to identify patterns in
trade that are generalizable across time, so we modify the cross validation approach to this

of trade (1) as well as four reduced models, each lacking either the log GDP variables, log
distance, the polity variables or cooperation. For each reduced model, regression coefficients
based on data from year t are then used to make predictions for the trade in year t + 1 (using
the x values from year t + 1), and the sum of squared prediction error is compared to that
of the full model.
Not surprisingly, GDP and distance are both important based on this measure, with the

GDP variables typically halving the one-year ahead predictive sum of squared error. The
results for polity and cooperation are more subtle: The results indicate that a model including regime type variables always gives better one-year-ahead predictions than the standard
gravity model. This suggests that the regime type variables have predictive power and that
the relationship between regime type and trade are not changing too quickly from year to
year. In contrast, adding cooperation as an explanatory variable adds no predictive benefit
in eight of the 19 comparisons made (out to 3 decimal places) and even decreases the oneyear-ahead predictive performance of the gravity model in 4 of the comparisons. The fact
that the ratios for these latter four years are only slightly lower than 1.0 is of little solace: in
these four cases, inclusion of cooperation in the model gives worse predictions. This suggests
that for these pairs of consecutive years the relationship between cooperation and trade, in
the presence of the other variables, is not generalizable from one year to the next.12
To get an idea how much a variable adds to one-year-out predictive performance “on
average,” we can simply take the mean of each column in Table 3. To assess how fast such a
pattern changes over time we can calculate R(M 1, M 2) as above to see how well a model fit
with data from year t predicts data from year t + k. We compute this ratio for each variable,
each year t, and each possible lag in years k, and average the results over t. The result is
a measure of the relative predictive performance of a model with and with out a particular
variable, in terms of predicting k years out. The results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Average k-year-out relative predictive performances of gravity models with and
without distance, polity effects and cooperation. Polity effects are generalizable out to about
eight years. Cooperation effects are not noticeable within the first three years are not generalizable past three years.
The results indicate that, on average, gravity models with the effects of regime type are
better than gravity models without, in terms of predicting up to eight years out. The effect
of cooperation is small and not consistent enough over time to have a positive predictive
effect. Even if the coefficient for cooperation was nominally significant in a given year, it is
likely that removing it from the regression would give a more generalizable model, even just
a few years out.
12

A similar forward selection type of approach could also be used to assess the temporal stability/predictive
performance of each variable, the results give a similar ordering of the importance of the above variables.

4.2

Persistence of latent structure

As shown in Section 3, dyadic trade data often exhibit substantial residual structure that
can be represented by additive exporter and importer specific effects as well as higher order
latent structure that can be analyzed via multiplicative effects. We evaluate the magnitude
of these effects and their persistence over time using the approach outlined above. For each
year t we decompose the residuals from Equation (1) into the additive exporter and importer
effects described in Equation (2) as well as the multiplicative effects of Equation (3), with
the dimension of the latent multiplicative vectors ranging from 1 to 4. These effects are
then used to make predictions for trade in years s : s 6= t. Specifically, when assessing the
persistence of the exporter and importer effects, we compute a set of predicted values for
year s, based on Equation (1) as estimated from data in year t:
ln Fˆi,j,s = βˆ0 +βˆ1 log Gi +βˆ2 log Gj +βˆ3 log Di,j +βˆ4 log Pi +βˆ5 log Pj +βˆ6 log Pi ×Pj +βˆ7 log Ci,j +ˆ
ai +ˆbj +ˆ
u′i vˆj ,
ˆ ai ,ˆbj ,ˆ
with β,ˆ
ui ,ˆ
vj all being estimated from year t and the covariates being from year s. The
fit of these predicted values is then compared to that of the predicted values made from
fitting the baseline gravity model of trade,
ln Fi,j = β0 + β1 log Gi + β2 log Gj + β3 log Di,j + ǫi,j .

Figure 6: The estimated additive and multiplicative country-specific effects provide considerable predictive performance. Model g+pc is the expanded gravity model of trade (1), g+pc+rc
also includes additive exporter and importer effects, g+pc+rc+uvk also includes multiplicative effects of dimension k. Model g+pc+E makes predictions based on the fitted expanded
gravity model plus the residuals.
The first panel in Figure 6 shows how well various models fit with data from year 1981
predict data from years 1982-2000, as compared to the standard gravity model (4). The
second panel averages these curves over years to provide a measure of the average k-year-out
predictive performance of the various models. The blue line gives the relative performance of
the expanded gravity model (2). The expanded gravity model improves predictions several
14

years out, but the improvement in fit is quite small compared to the improvement offered
by the latent structure. Additionally, note that the addition of the latent structure offers
substantial predictive improvement many years out, indicating that the latent structure is
real and persistent. If the residuals within a year were indeed pattern-less and not persistent
from year to year, then the non-blue lines in the plot should all be near or below 1.
Within a given year, as the dimension of the multiplicative effects increases the estimated
latent structure a
ˆi + ˆbj + uˆ′i vˆj becomes a closer approximation to the sociomatrix of residuals
ǫˆi,j for that year. One might argue that if trade patterns are not changing that quickly,
the best predictive model obtainable from a given year will be based on the regression
parameters estimated that year and the residuals from that year, i.e. representing the latent
structure with the residuals. Indeed, such a model typically gives the “best performance”
one or two years out, but after about two years the simpler models having 2 or 3 dimensional
multiplicative effects offer better predictions. This indicates that the sociomatrix of residuals
from a given year contains some structure that is persistent over time (represented with the
additive and multiplicative country-specific effects) in addition to “noise”, or non-persistent
structure. For example, the country specific effects estimated in 1981, 1990, and 2000 (as
displayed in Figure labelfigure:new) show some similar structure, even though they are based
on data observed once a decade.

Conclusion

The standard representation of bilateral international trade is the gravity model. In empirical tests, about half the variance in within sample trade can be explained by this simple
model which focuses on the sizes of the importing and exporting countries as well as the distance between them. Many scholars have added to this standard model important variables
capturing domestic as well as international forces. The power of these additions has been
typically gauged using inferential statistics. Almost universally, the additions have been
found to be statistically significant.
We show how this is misleading, and develop and apply a framework to combat this
tendency to affirm all new hypotheses about international commerce. Standard hypothesis
testing techniques based on ordinary linear regression models are not appropriate for assessing how generalizable the parameter estimates estimated in these models are. We have
proposed evaluating how generalizable results are based on a measure of out-of-sample predictive performance and we have used this metric to examine some empirical claims found
in the extant literature. We found that the domestic political framework (polity) of the
exporter and importer are important factors relating to trade. We also found that the relationship between trade and international conflict (specifically, cooperation in international
disputes) is small and not generalizable from one year to the next.
In addition, we have shown that a substantial amount of trade variation is attributable to
country-specific exporter and importer effects, effects typically assumed to be nonexistent.
These effects indicate strong geographic patterns unexplained by the gravity model, most
recognizably, the over-prediction of trade among OECD countries. Finally, the variation in
trade attributable to exporter and importer specific effects is large and persistent over time.
The estimation and reporting of such effects thus gives a more complete picture of patterns
in international trade.
Apart from the development of a new methodology for (re)examining empirical results
in the arena of dyadic models of international relations, what are the implications of these
findings? First and foremost, bilateral trade is determined mostly by the strength of the
large, vibrant economies, as suggested by macroeconomic theory. Democratization is cer15

tainly associated with increased trade, even in just one of the trading nations. Increased
democratization will serve to expand bilateral trade at a global level, as well as within pairs
of trading nations. These effects are important but are overwhelmed by the impact on
economic productivity as a result of international commerce. For example, recent work suggests even small increases in national productivity owing to increased trade will far outstrip
the potential economic impact of any politically plausible level of foreign aid. Cline (2004)
estimates that “. . . global free trade would confer income gains of at least about $90 billion annually in developing countries . . . and total long-term gains including dynamic effects
would be about $200 billion annually” (page 1). The 9% growth in Chinese GDP in 2004
coupled with its 25% growth in exports during the same period comes to mind. Thus, one
strong benefit of increasing democratization is its direct impact on international commerce,
and the subsequent impetus that brings to national productivity.
Beyond this, there has been considerable discussion of the importance of international
politics on commerce. Much of this is a consequence of variable selection and over-fitting.
International conflict does not bear much of an independent relationship to international
commerce. Indeed, we found compelling evidence that trying to use the behavior of nations
in militarized interstate disputes to explain trade leads to worse, not better, predictions. This
does not mean the conflict is good for commerce; neither does it suggest that cooperation
is bad for commerce. Our results are entirely in line with the suggestion that under some
circumstances the impact of trade on conflict is indeterminant (Morrow, Siverson & Tabares
1999). There are many reasons to promote a peaceful world, but there is little evidence that
increasing trade is one of them.
A better understanding of the enabling and constraining conditions of international commerce has important policy consequences. We have shown that global trade is highly structured and interdependent, even after taking standard macro economic and macro political
forces into account. As such it is important to analyze trade flows in a way that recognizes
the persistence of deep interdependencies in the global system of trade. It seems evident that
the deep, latent structure to the international trade network is likely to remain an important
force in the ebb and flow of daily international commerce.

bilateral exports and imports given in current U.S. dollars. There is a large number of extant attempts to collate data on intranational trade (for example, Farber & Nierop 1989,
Feenstra 2000, Gleditsch 2002, Barbieri, Keshk & Pollins 2003).
Data in Figure 1 on trade in 2002 was taken from the World Bank online data query engine
on Tuesday, November 16, 2004 at 8:15 am (http://devdata.worldbank.org/data-query/
with missing data estimated from the World Factbook 2004, online edition, found at http:

A.3

Distance

Distance was calculated using the Haversine formula with data on latitude and longitude of
capital cities taken from the world.cities database maintained as part of the maps package in
the R statistical programming package. These are available from cran.r-project.org. Distance
was calculated in 1000s of Kilometers.

A.4

GDP

Data on the annual Gross Domestic Product in current US dollars was taken from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators, available online at http://devdata.worldbank.
org/dataonline/.

A.5

Polity

We use the annualized polity score, which ranges from -10 for highly authoritarian states
to +10 for highly democratic societies, to gauge the domestic institutions in each country.
These data are available from http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/polity/, with registration. Some of these data were updated with information on so-called “micro-states” from
the separate database maintained at the University of California at San Diego by Kristian
Skrede Gleditsch (2003) Modified Polity P4 and P4D Data, Version 1.0., available at URL:
http://weber.ucsd.edu/∼kgledits/Polity.html.
There is a new, comprehensive list of available indices of governance, civil and corporate
at http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/govdatasets/external.html.

A.6

Militarized Interstate Disputes

We employed the Militarized Interstate Disputes database (version 3.02) which is maintained
by Faten Ghosn and Scott Bennett, and described in Codebook for the Dyadic Militarized
Interstate Incident Data, Version 3.0, 2003. These data and the documentation are available
at URL: http://cow2.la.psu.edu. Our measure of international interactions is coded −1
for each militarized interstate dispute in which country i is on the opposite side of the dispute
from country j; similarly, if i and j are on the same side in an interstate dispute, this is
scored +1. We sum dispute scores for each pair of countries if there is more than one ongoing
dispute in a given year.

A.7

Countries Analyzed

We used all the data available to us over the period from 1981, the beginning of availability for the UN Commodity Trad data using the HS2002 classifications. Each year in
our study had a different set of countries on which data were available. The superset of
184 countries is: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda,
Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Botswana,
Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Myanmar, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada,

Estimating multiplicative effects

The rank k least squares approximation to an n×n matrix Γ can be obtained by the singular
value decomposition of Γ (Householder and Young, 1938). This provides n × k matrices U
and V such that Aˆ = U V ′ minimizes ||Γ−A||2 among all rank k matrices A. In the context of
dyadic data where the diagonal of Γ is undefined, the computational problem can be written
in terms of weighted least-squares:
minimize

n
n X
X

wi,j (γi,j − u′i vj )2

i=1 j=1

subject to ui , vj ∈ Rk , wi,i = 0 and wi,j = 1 if i 6= j. This problem has been considered
by Gabriel and Zamir (1979), who provide an iterative “criss-cross” regression technique for
finding approximate solution. We have found that combining the regression technique with
a singular value decomposition gives an algorithm that converges much more quickly. The
algorithm we employ is as follows:
Given current values of U = {u1 , . . . , un } and V = {v1 , . . . , vn }, iterate the following
until convergence:
1. for i = 1, . . . , n:
(a) given the v-vectors, update ui as the vector of regression coefficients from γi,j =
u′i vj + δi,j , j 6= i.
(b) given the u-vectors, update vi be the vector of regression coefficients from γj,i =
vi′ uj + δj,i , j 6= i.
ˆ from Γ and having diagonal given by γi,i = u′i vi . Obtain
2. Obtain the n × n matrix Γ
ˆ
new values of U and V from the singular value decomposition of Γ.
R-code for obtaining U and V can be obtained at www.stat.washington.edu/hoff/research.html.
