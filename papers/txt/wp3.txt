How to Measure “What People Do For a Living” in
Research on the Socioeconomic Correlates of Health

ABSTRACT

In this paper we ask two questions. First, is occupational standing associated with
health outcomes when health-related criteria are used to establish the relative standing of
occupations? This is especially interesting in light of recent evidence (Miech and Hauser
2000) that occupational standing is not independently associated with health outcomes when
occupations are ranked using socioeconomic criteria. Second, are job characteristics more
closely related to health outcomes than occupational characteristics? We use data from the
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which includes a unique combination of occupational, job,
and health measures.

We find few independent relationships between occupational

standing and health, using socioeconomic or health-related criteria. However, we do find
many significant relationships between job characteristics and health outcomes.

We

conclude that what people do for a living does matter for their health, beyond the effects of
educational attainment, and that to assess the effects of what people do for a living on their
health we should measure the characteristics of their jobs, not of their occupations.

How to Measure “What People Do For a Living” in
Research on the Socioeconomic Correlates of Health

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES
Social and health scientists have long been concerned with the impact of
socioeconomic circumstances on physical and mental health, and this interest seems to have
grown markedly in recent years (Kaplan et al. 1997). Medical as well as social science journals
now regularly feature research that considers the influence of education, occupation, income,
and other variables on a variety of medical and public health problems. Our research is
concerned with the measurement of socioeconomic factors – particularly occupational and job
characteritics – in this area of study. In this paper we ask how conclusions about the health
impacts of what people do for a living are affected by how occupational and job characteristics
are measured and operationalized.
Occupations and Health
Innumerable

observers

have

reported

an

inverse

relationship

between

occupational standing (however measured) and mortality and morbidity rates (Marmot at
al 1987; Kaplan and Keil 1993; Marmot et al. 1997; Gregario et al. 1997; Borooah 1999;
Goodman 1999; Manor et al. 1999).

For just two examples, Marmot, et al. (1997)

showed that occupation affects self-reported health, rates of depression, and self-esteem
in the United States and England and Kitagawa and Hauser (1973) demonstrated that
occupation affects mortality in the United States. The fact that occupational standing and
health outcomes are inversely related is not surprising in light of research showing that
other indicators of socioeconomic standing – such as income, educational attainment, and

wealth – are also negatively associated with these outcomes. Marks and Shinberg (1997),
for example, showed that education, income, and occupation are all associated with the
odds that a woman received a hysterectomy by age 52.
However, socioeconomic variables such as education and income are certainly
correlated with occupational standing. Thus a logical question is whether occupation, per
se, directly matters for health or whether the apparent association between occupation
and health is spurious owing to education, income, or other variables.

Marks and

Shinberg (1997) found that occupation does have independent effects on the odds of
receiving a hysterectomy after controlling for education and income, but – using the same
set of data in an examination of different outcomes – Miech and Hauser (2000) found that
“associations of health outcomes with occupational standing net of educational
attainment are mainly weak or non-existent.”

As in most prior research, Miech and

Hauser (2000) utilized a variety of socioeconomic and class-based measures of the
relative standing of occupations in their analyses.

A central question in our research is

whether occupation matters for a variety of health outcomes when health-related – as
opposed to strictly socioeconomic – criteria are used to establish the relative standing of
occupations.
Selecting a Criterion for Ranking Occupations
Although any number of observers have reported an association between occupational
standing and health outcomes, very few of their analyses are directly comparable because of
vast differences in how “occupation” has been measured and operationalized.

This

overabundance of measures of occupational standing is understandable since the kind of work

2

that a person does for a living can be (and has been) characterized in terms of a wide array of
attributes of that social activity, any of which might matter for their health. Having a particular
occupation – such as dishwasher, legal secretary, X-ray technician, or high school teacher – is
associated with particular levels of financial remuneration; stress; social prestige; physical
exertion; autonomy; non-monetary benefits; intellectual engagement; exposure to hazardous
materials; scheduling flexibility; and so forth. These and other attributes of occupations are
typically correlated – such that better paying occupations tend to be less physically demanding,
less hazardous, and less stressful, for example – but these correlations are far from perfect.
Researchers who aim to assess the impact of occupation, broadly speaking, on health thus face
the difficult task of measuring important aspects of occupation that might conceivably
influence the health outcomes that interest them.
In their analyses, many researchers classify subjects’ occupations as belonging to one
of several nominal categories, such as “white collar” or “blue collar.”

Some of these

categorization schemes are more theoretically grounded than others. The “white collar”
vs. “blue collar” distinction, for example, seems to be based on simplicity or
convenience, whereas Wright’s (1996) class typology is solidly grounded in Marxist
theory.

Our comments on categorical schemes for expressing occupations apply equally

well to both. Using the former operationalization, the effects of occupation on health are
expressed as the conditional difference between “white collar” workers and “blue collar”
workers. This technique adequately captures the full impact of what people do for a living on
health outcomes if and only if all workers in a particular occupational category are exposed to
the same occupational hazards, are equally well paid, have equal levels of autonomy and

3

authority, and are equal with respect to every other job-related circumstance that might affect
health. If workers within a particular occupational category are heterogeneous with respect to
these job-related circumstances, then this operationalization likely leads to a biased assessment
of the effects of occupation on health.
Some social scientists use more refined systems to classify subjects’ occupations into
one of several hundred categories that can be ranked hierarchically in terms of some objective
criteria and treated as a continuous variable. For example, subjects’ occupations might be
classified as belonging to one of the 501 categories of the 1990 U.S. Census Occupational
Classification. Several distinct characteristics of these 501 occupations – for example, how
much they typically pay (occupational earnings), how prestigious they are considered to be
(occupational prestige), how much education is required (occupational education), and how
frequently occupational incumbents are injured (occupational injury rates) – have been
ascertained from various sources, and can be matched to the Census classification. The effects
of occupation on health are then expressed as the conditional association between health and a
continuous measure of occupational standing.
The first problem with this approach is that it is not obvious which objective criteria
researchers should use to rank occupations. Unfortunately, the decision about which criteria to
use tends to be based more on convenience and tradition and less on theoretically derived
notions of which aspect of occupations might matter most for health outcomes. Most analysts
express occupational standing in terms of just one continuous measure (or in terms of a
weighted average of two continuous measures, such as Duncan’s 1961 Socioeconomic Index or
SEI). How do conclusions about the effects of occupation on health depend on which objective

4

criteria is used to rank occupations? Miech and Hauser (2000) found few effects, net of
educational attainment, of occupational education, occupational earnings, SEI, or prestige on a
variety of health outcomes. We ask whether the use of health-relevant criteria for establishing
the relative standing of occupations – specifically occupational injury rates – might reveal
associations between occupation and health, even net of educational attainment.
The second potential problem with this approach is that if workers within a particular
occupational category are heterogeneous with respect to important job-related circumstances or
conditions, then this operationalization also leads to a biased assessment of the effects of
occupation on health. Specific jobs within occupational categories may be quite diverse in
terms of health-relevant variables.
These methodological issues surrounding the measurement of occupation are
worth worrying about because there is evidence that they matter for substantive
conclusions.

For example, in the context of research on occupational stratification,

Warren, Hauser, and Sheridan (1998) showed that important substantive conclusions
about gender differences in the process of occupational stratification were quite sensitive
to which criteria was used to rank the 503 occupations in the 1980 U.S. Census
classification. Their work follows on the heels of research showing that it matters (within
the context of occupational stratification research) whether occupations are ranked on the
basis of how prestigious they are or on the basis of SEI (Featherman and Hauser 1976;
Featherman and Stevens 1982) and on whether occupations are ranked on the basis of the
characteristics of their male incumbents, their female incumbents, or both (Boyd 1986;
Nakao and Teas 1994).

5

There is also limited evidence that the way in which occupation is measured and
expressed matters for substantive conclusions about the health consequences of
occupational standing.

For example, Miech and Hauser (2000) estimate the effects of

occupation on a variety of health outcomes, and in so doing they compare the predictive
validity of several measures of occupation: occupational prestige, SEI, occupational
education, occupational earnings, Wright’s (1997) social class typology, and Erikson and
Goldthorpe’s (1992) social class typology.

Although those authors found few

independent effects of any of their measures of occupational standing on several health
outcomes, they did find some interesting variability in the predictive power of their
measures.

Most notably, occupational education had the greatest predictive validity for

some outcomes, while Wright’s and Erikson and Goldthorpe’s social class typologies had
the least predictive validity.
Job-Based Versus Occupation-Based Measures of “What People Do For a Living”
Jobs and occupations are not the same thing (Hauser and Carr 1995). A job is a
specific bundle of activities, responsibilities, and behaviors that typically results in
financial remuneration; there may be as many jobs as there are employed people.

An

occupation, on the other hand, is a convenient aggregation of jobs that are similar in some
respect. Regardless of how occupations are grouped or which criteria are used to rank
them, within-occupation category heterogeneity in health-relevant aspects of jobs may
bias the estimated effects of occupation on health outcomes. That is, to the extent that
those aspects of jobs that affect health vary within occupational categories, our analyses
of the effects of that aspect of jobs on health will likely be biased.

6

While standard

practice has been to ascertain respondents’ occupations and then assign to each
respondent the aggregate characteristics of people in that occupation, Hauser and Carr
(1995: 40) note that “the best way to collect job information relevant to health and wellbeing may be to ask directly about the conditions of work.” Thus a central question in
our analysis is what difference it makes for research on the association between health
and what people do for a living when the latter is expressed in terms of the characteristics
of each respondent’s working conditions instead of in terms of the conditions typical of
people who do similar kinds of work.
We wonder whether job-based (as opposed to occupation-based) measures of
what people do for a living might be more closely associated with health outcomes.
Consider the findings of Link, Lennon, and Dohrenwend (1993), who conclude that
occupational

direction,

control,

and

planning

affect

depression/distress;

Link,

Dohrenwend, and Skodol (1986), who show that noisome work conditions are important
in the etiology of schizophrenia; and Karasek and colleagues (Karasek al. 1981; Karasek
et al. 1988), who argue that high job demands and decision-making latitude affect
coronary hear disease.

In each case, it seems plausible that there is a great deal of

variation in relevant job characteristics within each of the 500 or so U.S. Census
occupational categories.

By aggregating to the occupation level, prior research may be

missing important information about the relationship between “what people do for a
living” and health.
In our research we ask two specific questions. First, is occupational standing associated
with a variety of health outcomes when health-related criteria – occupational injury rates

7

– are used to establish the relative standing of occupations?

Second, how might

heterogeneity in what people do for a living within each of the hundreds of occupational
categories influence conclusions about the association between what people do for a living and
health? That is, might job characteristics be more closely related to health outcomes than
occupational characteristics? Miech and Hauser (2000) concluded that when utilizing the
socioeconomic criteria typically used to establish the relative standing of occupations –
occupational education, occupational earnings, SEI, and prestige – there appear to be few and
weak associations between occupation and health net of educational attainment. This implies
that what people do for a living doesn’t matter for their health once their education has been
accounted for. We ask whether this finding persists when we use alternate criteria to rank
occupations or when we use job-based characteristics of what people do for a living.
DATA
We use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). The WLS has followed a
cohort of 10,317 Wisconsin high school graduates from their senior year of high school in
1957 through the early 1990s (with a remarkably high rate of sample retention). The WLS
data are especially useful for our purposes. Respondents’ occupations at age 52-53 were
coded to the standards of the 1990 Census, such that they can be mapped into occupationbased measures like those described above. In addition, the WLS questionnaire ascertained
the details of respondents’ job characteristics – like like how much they get paid per hour, how
often they get dirty, how much autonomy they have, how often they are exposed to hazardous
materials, how they rate their jobs relative to an average job, and so forth. The 1993 mail
survey of WLS respondents also contains rich information about a large selection of self-

8

reported health outcomes and medical conditions at age 52 or so. Each of these occupation,
job, and health measures are described below.
Care must be taken when generalizing from results derived from analyses of WLS
data.

Sample members are all 52-53 year old high school graduates and are almost

universally White. About one in five is of farm origins, and about 70 percent still lived
in Wisconsin 35 years after their graduation from high school. However, prior research
has profitably used WLS data for research on socioeconomic gradients in health (Hauser
and Carr 1995; Marmot et al 1997; Marks and Shinberg 1997; Miech and Hauser 2000)
and the WLS’s unique combination of occupational, job, and health measures make
these data most suitable for our purposes.
In selecting our analysis sample, we began by determining the four most prevalent
self-reported health problems and the five most prevalent self-reported medical
conditions for both men and women. We then selected all cases with no missing data on
these health outcome variables or on educational attainment, current or last occupation in
1992/3, or the job characteristic variables (including hourly wage rate) that we describe
below.

This sample selection scheme leaves us with 82% – 5,645 of 6,875 – of the

respondents who participated in the 1993 WLS mail survey.
Measuring Occupational and Job Characteristics
Table 1 describes variables representing educational attainment and occupational
standing, separately for men and women. Educational attainment is measured as years of
school completed; by definition, all sample members have completed at least 12 years of
schooling.

We use four measures of the socioeconomic characteristics of occupations

9

and six measures of the injury-related characteristics of occupations.

Occupational

prestige represents the relative desirability or goodness of an occupation, and is based on
the subjective ranking of occupations by respondents to the 1989 General Social Survey
(Nakao and Treas 1994). Prior work has established the invariability of these and other
relative prestige ratings; regardless of sex, social class, industrialized country, or
instructions about how to rank occupations, respondents tend to agree about the relative
prestige position of detailed occupational categories. Nakao-Treas prestige scores range
from 0 to 100, where higher numbers represent more desirable occupations.

Our

measures of occupational education and occupational earnings were constructed by
Hauser and Warren (1997) for use with the 1990 Census Occupational Classification.
Occupational education is based on the proportion of incumbents in each occupation
who completed one or more years of college.

Occupational earnings is based on the

proportion of incumbents in each occupation who earned more than $25,000 in 1989.
Each of these proportions was transformed into a started logit of the form log[(p +
.01)/(1 - p + .01)], where p is the proportion of the occupational incumbents above the
threshold.

This transformation reduces heteroscedasticity in the transformed variable

without creating extreme outliers (Mosteller and Tukey 1977:109-115; Hauser and
Warren 1997), and yields measures that range from about –4.5 to about 4.5 in our
sample.

Finally, we use a nominal categorization of occupations that further aggregates

respondents’ occupations into 17 major occupation groups such as “professional and
technical specialty occupations” and “administrative support occupations.”

10

This

measure corresponds to (frequently less detailed) nominal classifications often used in
research in this area of research.
All injury-related occupational characteristics are derived from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics’ 1994 Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. These data report
the occupation-specific number and cause of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses
involving days away from work in 1993, the year that most WLS respondents reported
the characteristics of their current or most recent jobs and occupations.

For each

occupation category we computed rates of occupational injuries by dividing the number
of injuries in that occupation in 1993 by the total number of people who held that
occupation according to data from the 1990 U.S. Census. The “total occupational injury
rate” simply reflects the number of occupational injuries per 10,000 occupational
incumbents in 1993.

The other five occupational injury rates are cause-specific.

For

example, the “slip or fall occupational injury rate” reflects the number of occupational
injuries due to slipping or falling per 10,000 incumbents in 1993. Because of the skewed
distributions of the occupational injury rate variables, we have transformed them by
adding a small constant at taking their natural logarithm.
Although we wonder whether occupational injury rates might be more closely
related

to

health

outcomes

than

occupational

socioeconomic

characteristics,

we

acknowledge that these measures are not ideal. We would prefer to have measures of the
extent to which occupational incumbents are exposed to dangerous conditions, do
repetitive work, overexert themselves, and so forth. However, we are only able to use
indirect indicators of these things.

We are forced to assume that if injuries due to

11

overexertion, for example, are high in a particular occupation, then people who hold that
occupation are required to overexert themselves more often than people in other
occupations.
Table 2 reports the correlations among these educational attainment, base hourly
wage rate (described below), and socioeconomic and injury-related occupational
characteristics (with the exception of the Group II measure, which is a nominal variable).
The socioeconomic occupational characteristics are highly inter-correlated; likewise, the
occupational injury rate measures are highly inter-correlated.

More interestingly, the

socioeconomic and injury-related characteristics of occupations are quite closely related.
The correlations of occupational injury rates with occupational prestige and occupational
education range between –0.55 and –0.66; their correlations with occupational earnings
are more modest, ranging from –0.32 to –0.53.

Simply put, occupations that enjoy

higher social esteem, that require more educational credentials, and that tend to pay
better are typically much safer occupations.

Interestingly, educational attainment and

base hourly wage rate are each more closely related to the socioeconomic characteristics
of occupations than to the injury-related occupational characteristics.
Table 3 describes variables that characterize respondents’ jobs. Many of the job
characteristic measures are loosely parallel to measures of occupational characteristics.
For example, WLS respondents were asked how much education most people in jobs like
their have (paralleling the occupational education measure), how many hours they spend
on their jobs doing the same things over and over (paralleling the repetition occupational
injury rate), and how often they are exposed to disease agents, dangerous equipment, or

12

hazardous chemicals (paralleling the exposure occupational injury rate).

Other measures

indicate whether respondents’ jobs require lots of physical effort, require intense
concentration or attention, require working under the pressure of time, or involve getting
dirty.

Respondents were also asked how many hours they spend working with their

hands, tools or equipment and how many hours they spend dealing with people about
work. The base hourly wage rate was computed based on information about respondents’
earnings, hours worked per week, and weeks worked in the 12 months preceding the
survey; to reduce skew in the distribution of this variable, we have taken its natural
logarithm after adding a small constant.

The WLS contains other measures of job

characteristics, but we have selected a set of measures that might conceivably have
implications for respondents’ health.

For example, respondents who work in jobs that

require lots of physical effort, that involve getting dirty, that are repetitious, and/or that
involve exposure to dangerous or hazardous conditions might quite reasonably have
poorer health outcomes than respondents who work in other jobs.

Likewise, jobs that

involve stressors – such as intense concentration, time pressure, or dealing with people –
might have different consequences for jobholders than less stressful jobs.
Measuring Health Problems and Medical Conditions
Table 4 describes variables pertaining to respondents’ self-reported health
problems and medical conditions. For both men and women we begin with self-reported
overall health. Respondents were asked, “How would you rate your health at the present
time?”

Because of the distribution of responses, we group respondents into those who

said “good” or “excellent” and those who said “fair,” “poor,” or “very poor.”

13

Interestingly, this self-reported overall health measure is closely related to clinically
diagnosed health problems and is a better predictor of mortality than physician-assessed
health (Mossey and Shapiro 1982).
WLS respondents were presented with a list of 24 health problems and asked
whether they had experienced them in the past six months.

They were then asked to

report the frequency with which they experienced each problem and how much
discomfort each problem had caused them in the past six months. For each self-reported
health problem, we coded a respondent as having that problem if they reported
experiencing it at least daily in the past six months and indicated that it caused them at
least some discomfort.

As noted earlier, our analyses consider only the four most

frequently self-reported health problems for men and the four most frequently selfreported health problems for women. As it turns out, three of these health problems –
back pain or strain, stiff or swollen joints, and aching muscles – are frequently
experienced by both men and women.

Male respondents also frequently report

experiencing ringing in their ears and female respondents frequently report having
trouble sleeping.
WLS respondents were also presented with a list of 17 medical conditions and
asked whether a medical professional has said they have that condition.

Here we

selected the five medical conditions most frequently reported by men and the five
medical conditions most frequently reported by women. Four medical conditions – high
blood pressure, arthritis or rheumatism, allergies, and serious back problems – are
frequently experienced by both men and women.

14

Men also frequently report

experiencing heart problems and women frequently report circulation problems.
Respondents were also asked how much each condition interferes with what they like to
do, but we have not taken this information into account; high blood pressure, for
example, is still a serious medical condition even if it does not directly interfere with
respondents’ daily lives.
RESULTS
We ask two central questions. First, net of educational attainment, is occupation
associated with health outcomes when occupational injury rates are used to establish the
relative standing of occupations?

Second, are job characteristics more closely and

independently associated with health outcomes than occupational characteristics? Following
Miech and Hauser (2000), we begin by estimating the effect of educational attainment on an
outcome, and then ask whether the addition of a given occupational or job characteristic
variables adds to the fit of the model. Our decisions about improvement in model fit are
initially based on standard χ2 tests, but we temper our conclusions by using the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) as suggested by Raftery (1995). BIC provides a better-calibrated
assessment of the evidence for a hypothesis than P-values in analyses of data from large
samples. Our tests of statistical significance compare the fit of models that do not include job
or occupational characteristics variables to those that do.
Table 5 reports the results of models predicting self-reported health problems and
medical conditions for men, and Table 6 reports these results for women. The first row
of each table suggests – with a few exceptions – that educational attainment has negative
and statistically significant effects on these health outcomes.

15

For men, educational

attainment is significantly related to 8 of 10 outcomes using conventional criteria for
statistical significance and to 5 of these outcomes using the more conservative BIC.

For

women, conventional significance criteria show an effect of education in 7 of 10 cases,
but BIC suggests that only 4 of these associations are very robust.
The next section of Tables 5 and 6 reports the improvement in model chi-square
associated with adding measures of the socioeconomic characteristics of occupations.
This section of our analysis loosely replicates part of the work of Miech and Hauser
(2000), although they used the 1970 Census Occupational Classification and a slightly
different subset of respondents.

Our results, however, are quite similar.

Using

conventional standards of statistical significance, occupational prestige, occupational
education, occupational earnings, and Group II occupation categories are associated with
health outcomes about a quarter of the time for men (with those associations most
frequently involving occupational education and occupational earnings) and almost
never for women. In only one case for men and in no cases for women do any of these
associations approach statistical significance using BIC. That is, like Miech and Hauser
(2000),

we

find

that

significant

associations

between

health

outcomes

and

socioeconomic measures of occupational standing are very much the exception to the
rule.
Injury-related measures of occupational standing seem to fare little better.

The

next section of Tables 5 and 6 reports the improvement in model chi-square associated
with adding injury-related measures of occupations standing. For men, only once does
the addition of occupational injury rate information add to the fit of the model, and this

16

association is weak using BIC.

For women, occupational injury rates appear to be

particularly associated with aching muscles and arthritis or rheumatism, and overall –
again, using standard criteria for assessing statistical significance – about one in six null
hypotheses are rejected. However, using BIC, only one of these associations appears to
be robust.
The final section of Tables 5 and 6 reports the improvement in model chi-square
associated with adding job characteristic variables.

For men, at least one job

characteristic affects each of the 10 health outcomes using the conventional chi-squared
criteria; indeed, we would reject the null hypothesis of no association in 33 of these 120
models.

For aching muscles and arthritis or rheumatism, 7 of the 11 measures have

significant effects for men.

In the models for women, at least one job characteristic

affects 9 of 10 health outcomes, and – still using conventional criteria for hypothesis
testing – we would reject the null model in 35 of 110 cases. For women, 6 of the 11
measures affect aching muscles, 6 of 11 affect serious back problems, and 4 of 11 affect
stiff or swollen joints. When we use BIC to assess statistical significance, we reject the
null hypothesis in only 7 cases for men and 9 for women.

That is, most of the

associations that are significant by conventional standards are not significant using the
better-calibrated BIC standards.
The associations that remain using the Bayesian Inference Criteria are interesting.
Of the 7 significant effects of job characteristics for men, 4 affect aching muscles. The
typical education level of jobholders, hours spent working with hands, repetitive work,
and exposure to dangerous equipment all affect the odds that a man experienced

17

discomfort from aching muscles at least daily in the past six months.

Thus for men,

dangerous, repetitive, hands-on work seems to be associated with aching muscles. Also,
men with higher base hourly wage rates report better overall health, men whose jobs
involve frequent physical effort are more likely to experience arthritis or rheumatism,
and men who frequently deal with people and who are exposed to disease agents are
more likely to suffer from allergies.
For women, frequent physical effort, frequent time pressure, and getting dirty all
affect the odds of discomfort from aching muscles.

Like men, women with higher base

hourly wage rates report better overall health. Women who get dirty on the job are more
likely to experience arthritis or rheumatism, women whose jobs require frequent physical
effort are more likely to have been diagnosed with serious back problems, and women
are more likely to suffer from circulation problems if their jobs require frequent physical
effort or getting dirty.
From a public health point of view, we do not wish to make too much of the
significant associations involving job characteristics shown in Tables 5 and 6. Many of
the associations seem to have some face validity – it makes sense that men who do
repetitive work have aching muscles, and that women whose jobs require frequent
physical effort experience aching muscles and serious back problems – but our methods
of selecting job characteristics and health outcomes were not designed to yield
substantive findings about particular health problems.
disposal.

They were the data at our

Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate that some job characteristics have independent

effects on some health outcomes, whereas almost no occupational characteristics have

18

any independent effects.

For any particular health outcome, our 12 job characteristics

are not necessarily the most pertinent or consequential aspect of what people do for a
living.

For the medical condition “serious back problem” we might like to know, for

example, how often subjects lift objects and how heavy those objects are. Conversely,
for any particular job characteristic, these health outcomes are not necessarily the health
outcomes most likely to be affected.

We might speculate, for instance, that the job

characteristic “frequent intense concentration” might affect the odds of discomfort from
eyestrain.
DISCUSSION
We began by asking two questions. First, we asked whether occupational standing is
associated with health outcomes when health-related criteria – occupational injury rates –
are used to establish the relative standing of occupations. From the work of Miech and
Hauser

(2000)

we

expected

that

socioeconomic

characteristics

of

occupations

(occupational prestige, occupational education, and occupational earnings) would not be
associated with these outcomes, but we wondered whether occupational standing might
be associated with these outcomes when the criteria used to rank occupations is more
proximally related to health. Our results conform to those of Miech and Hauser (2000),
but the answer to our own question is clearly “no.”

Occupational injury rates are not

associated with the health outcomes that we considered after controlling for educational
attainment.

As discussed above, however, occupational injury rates may not be ideal

measures of occupational incumbents’ exposure to risk factors for various health
problems or medical conditions.

The strong associations between occupational injury

19

rates and occupational socioeconomic characteristics suggest that such measures might be
put to interesting use in research on occupational stratification, but their utility for
research on health outcomes appears to be limited – at least for the outcomes we
considered.
Second, we asked how heterogeneity in work experiences within occupational
categories might influence conclusions about the relationships between what people do for a
living and their health.

To address this, we considered whether job – as opposed to

occupational – characteristics are more closely related to health outcomes after controlling for
educational attainment. Here, the answer is a qualified “yes.” Some job characteristics are
independently related to some of the health outcomes that we considered, even using the more
stringent BIC criteria for assessing statistical significance. The significant associations make
intuitive sense, although not all of the intuitively sensible associations (e.g., between frequency
of working with hands and arthritis or rheumatism) were significant. We are led to conclude
that what people do for a living does matter for their health, above and beyond the effects of
educational attainment, and that to assess the nature and magnitude of the effects of what
people do for a living on their health we should measure the characteristics and requirements of
their jobs, not of their occupations.
With that said, we are not willing to make any substantive conclusions about the
relationships between any of the job characteristics that we used and any of the health
outcomes that we considered. In order to do so, we would need to follow methods of
selecting measures of job characteristics that are quite different from those employed in
this research. If our goal were to assess the association between what people do for a

20

living and their odds of developing a particular medical condition, we would begin by
cataloging the risk factors for that medical condition. We would then collect information
from respondents about the extent to which they are exposed to each of those risk factors
on the job. Subjects may well be exposed to those same risk factors away from the job as
well, so we would need to be careful to assess the added and unique exposure to those
risk factors associated with on the job activities and conditions.
With information about all job characteristics relating to risk factors for a
particular medical condition in hand, we would then be in a position to assess the
association between what people do for a living and that particular medical condition. Of
course different medical conditions have different risk factors, and so the information that
we would want to gather about job characteristics might differ if our focus is on another
medical condition. In the present study, we simply selected a set of 12 job characteristics
that seemed like they might reasonably have mattered for people’s health – whether they
get dirty, how frequently they are exposed to dangerous chemicals, and so forth – but we
had no a priori reason for expecting those specific job characteristics to matter for any
particular health problem or medical condition.
The fact that some of them did matter should encourage researchers to collect and
use information about what people do for a living in investigations of the relationship
between socioeconomic status and health.

What we are suggesting, of course, is that

researchers who collect data for the purpose of assessing the association between
socioeconomic status and health should include specific, detailed, and health outcomespecific survey questions about job characteristics in their surveys.

21

It may well be

possible and desirable to develop a standard set of survey questions that captures
everything we would want to know about people’s jobs in research on socioeconomic
differentials in particular health outcomes.

It means, however, that we must first put

some thought and effort into determining what we would want to know about people’s
jobs for research on any particular health problem or medical condition.
Beyond issues of measurement, we must also recognize that cross-sectional data
are not perfectly suited to assessing the association between what people do for a living
and their health. (Our data are, in fact, longitudinal, but measures of job characteristics
and health outcomes are available only in the most recent wave of survey data.) People
change jobs, and thus they change the extent to which they are exposed to health-relevant
working conditions and the frequency with which they engage in health-relevant
activities.

It seems reasonable to suppose, furthermore, that people sometimes change

jobs because of their health or because former jobs put their health at risk in some way.
A more complete understanding of the impact of what people do for a living on health
outcomes would need to focus longitudinally on the characteristics of prior jobs as well
as those of the jobs that respondents hold at the time that their health outcomes are
assessed.
