There has been a growing interest in the application of social network theory to the epidemiology of sexually-transmitted diseases (STD).1 This interest
arises from recognition that STDs are transmitted through binary contacts and,
consequently, predictions about STD epidemics are unlikely to be robust to the
mass-action assumptions of classical mathematical epidemiology.2 Substantial attention has recently been given to the possibility that human sexual networks
exhibit scale-free behavior.3, 4 We consider scale-free networks that arise when
the probability mass function for partner number (i.e., network degree) is given
by a power law, P (k) ∝ k −α , with 2 < α ≤ 3. Such networks are characterized
by a degree distribution with infinite variance, and since the epidemic threshold
parameter increases linearly with the variance under behavioral heterogeneity,2
the epidemic threshold should always be exceeded in such a scale-free system.
We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the scaling exponent in the discrete power-law distribution, and show that the statistical fit of the power-law
model is very poor for a large local network data set from Uganda. This finding
suggests that human sexual networks may be more complex than simple analogy
to computer networks might suggest, and that a more flexible, actor-based approach to modeling sexual networks is required to understand and control STD
epidemics.
We use data from the Rakai Project Sexual Network Survey.5 The sample consists of
the elicited counts of sexual partners for the last year and lifetime of 1353 men (573) and
women (780) ages 15-49. From these data, we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates
of the discrete version of the probability model presented by May and Lloyd.4 This model is
1

typically known as the zeta distribution,6 which specifies that the probability of observing a
node degree of exactly k is given by,

P (K = k) =

1
,
ζ(α)k α

(1)

where ζ(α), the Riemann zeta function of α.
The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the scaling parameter α in equation 1 is
the solution α
ˆ of:

−

ζ 0 (α)
= log(k)
ζ(α)

(2)

where log(k) is the mean of the log-degree distribution. The uncertainty of the MLE can be
estimated by the bootstrap

7

and is approximately normally distributed.6

In figures 1 and 2, we plot the observed frequency of degree k against k together with
the maximum likelihood fits to the model with 95% confidence intervals. While the fit is
somewhat better for men than it is for women, both fits are clearly very bad. This result
may appear somewhat surprising given that a fit by eye yields the expected slope for a
scale free network (2 < α ≤ 3). However, neither visual nor OLS regression

8

fits to such

plots are appropriate since the values of a distribution function will be highly correlated and
inhomogeneous in variance.
The scaling parameter for the population of women in Uganda is outside of the range
b = 4.659), while the scaling parameter for men falls
of scale-free behavior (CI [4.21, 5.09]; α
b = 2.54). When we estimate the
within the region of scale-free behavior (CI [2.38, 2.69]; α

scaling parameter conditional on observations of degree kmin ≥ 2, the lower bound of the
2

confidence interval is above the range of scale-free networks. In fact, higher values of kmin
infer increasing values. As the power law scaling is supposed to capture the behavior of the
tail of the degree distribution, this finding suggests that this sexual network is not scalefree. Respondent reporting of the number of sexual partners in the extreme upper tail is
notoriously suspect.9 Our fits of power law models that are robust to this reporting bias tend
to support somewhat lower values of the scaling parameter. This suggests that upper tail
misreporting should receive special attention when assessing the statistical validity of power
law models to sexual network data.
We applied these methods to 1996 Swedish data derived from figure 2a of Liljeros et al.3
with similar results. Higher values of kmin infer more divergent values for the scaling again
suggesting a poor fit of the scale-free model to the observed local network structure. The
version of the power law model that represents k as a continuous variable infers values of α
above the scale-free range for both Uganda and Sweden.
The censoring of partners makes the fitting of models to reported lifetime partner count
data problematic. Cross-sectional survey data on the degree distribution contain considerable
hidden reporting heterogeneity as the cumulative lifetime partner count is likely to increase
with age. To assess this quantitatively, we fit a Poisson generalized linear model, using age
as a covariate. Age has a significant effect on the expected lifetime reported partner count
in both men (Poisson GLM, βage = 0.069, z = 41.43, p < 0.001) and women (Poisson GLM,
βage = 0.017, z = 41.43, p < 0.001). Given the exceptionally poor fit of the yearly degree
scaling, together with the censoring, we must treat the fit of the lifetime degree scaling with
skepticism. The epidemiological significance of cumulative lifetime networks can also be
questioned since these are not the structures that an STD pathogen must navigate in order
3

to persist in a population. The actual network over which a pathogen passes is extremely
sparse, a fact which has made statistical estimation of sexual networks extremely challenging.
Our results have important implications for the interpretation of random graph models
of social networks. The power law model predicts that there will only be an epidemic transition in a small region of the parameter space of α. Our statistical estimates of α place
it well outside of these limits, and in a region where an epidemic on a scale-free network is
impossible.10 Given the fact that Uganda has one of the highest HIV incidence rates in the
world, the scale-free power law model clearly fails to describe Ugandan sexual networks.
Public health policy aimed toward eradication of STD pathogens can benefit tremendously from theory derived from mathematical models of underlying biological and behavioral processes.11 The continued development of a theory of STD epidemiology should be
grounded in the behavior of the individual actors who comprise the social networks along
which pathogens propagate. The development of a rigorous theory of STD epidemiology
will benefit from combining traditional mathematical approaches with the inferential tools
of statistical science.12
