Abstract
Recent approaches to development accounting reflect substantial model uncertainty at both
the instrument and the development determinant level. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)
has been proven useful in resolving model uncertainty in economics, and we extend BMA to
formally account for model uncertainty in the presence of endogeneity. The new methodology
is shown to be highly eﬃcient and to reduce many-instrument bias; in a simulation study
we found that IVBMA estimates reduced mean squared error by 60% over standard IV
estimates. We also introduce Bayesian over and under-identification tests that are based
on model averaged predictive p-values. This approach is shown to mitigate the reduction
in power these tests experience as dimension increases. In a simulation study where the
exogeneity of the instrument is compromised we show that the classical Sargan test has a
power of 0.2% while our Bayesian over-identification test has a power of 98% at detecting
the violation of the exogeneity assumption. An application of our method to a prominent
development accounting approach leads to new insights regarding the primacy of institutions.
Using identical data and robustness specifications we find support not only for institutions,
but also for geography and integration, once both model uncertainty and endogeneity have
been jointly addressed.

Introduction

The hallmark of the recent development literature is the distinction between proximate and
fundamental development determinants. Proximate causes (technology, physical and human
capital, etc) are the focus of cross-country growth regressions that are subject to substantial
model uncertainty. The degree of model uncertainty is expressed by the 140 or so candidate regressors that have been suggested by competing theories.1 Fundamental determinants
(e.g., geography, institutions, and culture) are examined in the recent development literature, which is hampered by instrument uncertainty since a multitude of competing theories
motivate numerous candidate instruments for identification.2
Raftery (1995) argued that uncertainty surrounding particular theories should be addressed explicitly by the statistical approach. Standard errors based on a single model can
be underestimated when the uncertainty surrounding the validity of theories has been ignored. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has been used extensively to account for model
uncertainty in growth regressions.3 To date, instrument uncertainty has been addressed
only in standard robustness analyses that juxtapose one particular Instrumental Variable
(IV) theory/specification against another. In one of the most prominent examples, Rodrik
et al. (2004), henceforth RST, motivate their work by a “horse race” among alternative
theories that propose candidate instruments and regressors.
Accounting for uncertainty about both growth determinants and instruments requires a
methodology that is rooted in statistical theory. Durlauf et al. (2007) introduced an IV
model selection procedure to evaluate coeﬃcient estimates according to t-statistics, while
warning of the tenuous nature of the underlying theory. The most comprehensive approach
to addressing endogeneity in growth regressions has previously been proposed by Durlauf
et al. (2008), who built on Tsangarides (2004). The authors introduced a model averaged
version of Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS), but noted that their heuristic approach lacked
statistical justification.4 Strictly speaking, Durlauf et al. (2008) also did not allow for instrument uncertainty, but provided a model averaging approach to instrument candidate
regressors in the second stage only. We extend the Durlauf et al. (2008) approach and
develop formal statistical foundations for an instrumental variable BMA (IVBMA) methodology that addresses model uncertainty in the presence of endogeneity.
We conduct a thorough exploration of the properties of IVBMA as a valid IV estimator
and show that the procedure is a consistent methodology that reduces the well known manyinstrument bias in standard IV regressions. A simulation study conducted below shows this
reduction in bias and also a 60% reduction in mean squared error for estimating regression

coeﬃcients. Instrumental variable estimation of any kind requires a number of assumptions
that relate to the identification of the implied structural model.
Frequently, as is the case in the Sargan (1958) and Cragg and Donald (1993) tests, a
test statistic is compared to a reference distribution. The test statistic is often only asymptotically distributed according to the reference distribution, which frequently has a degrees
of freedom related to the size of the model estimated. The nature of these statistics proves
problematic when working with growth data, for which sample size is small and dimension
is continually increasing.
The Bayesian approach provides a direct interpretation of the eﬃcacy of an instrumentation strategy, by examining posterior inclusion probabilities. However, we also provide
alternative measures to verify IV assumptions that are based on model averaged Bayesian
predictive p-values. Rubin (1984) and Gelman et al. (1996) discussed the use of posterior
predictive p-values for a single model.
Here we introduce the concept of model averaged p-values. We provide Bayesian tests for
over-identification (based on the Sargan test), and a Bayesian test for under-identification
(based on Cragg and Donald 1993) to examine instrument conditions within IVBMA. In a
simulation study of moderate dimension in which a proposed instrument does not satisfy the
exogeneity assumption, we found that the Bayesian over-identification test had a power of
98% at detecting this failure, while the traditional Sargan test had a power of only 0.2%.
IVBMA is then applied to a prominent approach to development accounting that features
both instrument and determinant uncertainty. We first replicate the robustness analysis of
RST, whose analysis led the authors to endorse the “primacy of institutions” over all other
alternative theories. Using their own data and robustness specifications, but allowing for a
principled approach to determinant and instrument uncertainty, we find that strong conclusions regarding any primacy of institutions must be modified. Not only institutions but also
integration and geography are shown to have a clear eﬀect on long term development once
instrument and determinant uncertainty is addressed as part of the statistical approach.5
At the instrument level, we find that, once we allow for instrument uncertainty evidence,
Settler Mortality may, at times, not be robust to the inclusion of alternative instruments
suggested by RST in their robustness specification. The exercises highlight that the results
presented in RST may have relied on specific robustness specifications that do not generate
the greatest model performance given the entire instrument and covariate space suggested
by the authors. The resolution of model uncertainty at both the development determinant
and the instrument level allows us to isolate additional models that receive stronger support
from the same data.
The IVBMA approach thus highlights the extent to which results may be aﬀected by
focusing on particular specifications without accounting for the complexity of the model uncertainty that may be present in both stages of the IV approach. Our result is similar to
the findings of Durlauf et al. (2008), who document that many theories/variables are not
robust once model uncertainty is integrated into the statistical framework. Our approach
5

Glaeser et al. (2004) rejected the primacy of institutions, contending that the proximate causes in

previous approaches measured policy choices. Measurement error is not addressed in our approach.

diﬀers, however, as we develop a formal methodology that is specifically designed to resolve
endogeneity in the presence of model uncertainty.
Previous approaches to resolving endogeneity and identifying proximate and fundamental growth determinants are not limited to the papers and datasets we explore below. The
purpose of our paper is to introduce IVBMA methodology and provide applications that
highlight the importance of model uncertainty at both the determinant and instrument
stages. Alternative approaches to development accounting include Mauro (1995), who first
suggested ethnolinguistic fragmentation as a fundamental determinant of corruption, and
Hall and Jones (1999), who introduced Latitude and Language indicators as instruments to
measure western influence. Acemoglu et al., (2001b; 2001a) suggested population density in
1500 and colonial origins as eﬀective instruments, respectively. La Porta et al. (2004) presented yet another ”horse race” of theories, in their case juxtaposing judicial independence
and constitutional review. In RST the ”horse race” is between three possible determinants:
Institutions, Integration, and Geography. Geography-based theories of fundamental development determinants have previously been proposed by Bloom and Sachs (1998), Easterly
and Levine (2003), and Sachs (2003).
The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the statistical approach that underlies
IVBMA and discusses theoretical properties of the technique. Section 3 describes a simulation study, while Section 4 revisits key robustness results to highlight the importance of
both determinant and instrument uncertainty in the recent development literature. Section
5 concludes.

Theoretical Properties of IVBMA

It is standard to address endogeneity by applying two-stage least squares (2SLS) and imposing over-identification and instrument restrictions as expressed by
�
�
W
�
Y =β
+ η,
(1)
X
�
W = θZ� Z + θX
X + �,

(2)

where Y is the dependent variable, X is a set of covariates, W is the set of endogenous
variables, and Z is the set of instruments. Both X and θX have dimension pX , while Z and
θZ have dimension pZ . To simplify exposition we assume that W is univariate. Assuming
that
�� � � 2

(3)
�

ση� σ�2

the classical endogenous variable situation arises when ση� �= 0, causing W to violate the
standard regression assumption of independence of the error term, η.
In the presence of endogeneity, it is well known that the determination of W leads to
inconsistent estimates of the entire coeﬃcient vector, β, under standard Ordinary Least
4

Squares (OLS). The 2SLS estimator solves the consistency problem, but relies on the existence of a set of instruments, Z, which are independent of Y , given W and the vector of
covariates, X. The IV estimates derived in the second stage, βˆIV , obtained using the fitted
values from the first stage, w,
˜ are consistent only if the conditional independence assumptions are valid.
Several problems can arise. A key concern in IV estimation is that the estimates of βˆIV
are biased and that the extent of this bias increases with the number of terms that are
added in the first stage with coeﬃcients equal, or close to, zero. In that case, the instrumental variable results are not necessarily better than the biased OLS results (Davidson and
MacKinnon, 2004). Another concern is that IV is a large-sample procedure, implying that
even when all assumptions are met, there exists the distinct possibility of finite sample biases
(see Bound et al. (1995)). The prospect of this type of bias looms large in development accounting applications, where samples rarely exceed 100 observations. A third concern for IV
estimation is that economic data rarely present clear-cut instruments that have both strong
explanatory power on the endogenous variables and unquestionable conditional independence properties in relation to the dependent variable. Over-identification tests such as the
one proposed by Sargan (1958) help verify the validity of instrument assumptions, but can
often become ineﬀective as the dimension of the problem increases in small sample situations.

2.1

Statistical Foundations

IVBMA combines the IV and BMA methodologies. It processes the data much like a two
stage estimator while also addressing model uncertainty in both stages. The first stage is a
simple application of BMA to identify eﬀective instruments. As we introduce notation, it is
helpful to review the properties of BMA that are implied in stage 1.
Let ∆ be a quantity of interest and let the set of potential models in the first stage, M,
be comprised of individual models {M1 , . . . , MI }. The posterior distribution of ∆ given the
data, D, is given by the weighted average of the predictive distribution under each model,
weighted by the corresponding posterior probabilities,
pr(∆|D) =

I
�
i=1

pr(∆|Mi , D)pr(Mi |D),

(4)

where pr(∆|Mi , D) is the predictive distribution given model Mi and pr(Mi |D) is the posterior model probability of model Mi . The posterior model probability πi , for each first stage
model Mi is given by
πi = pr(Mi |D) ∝ pr(D|Mi )pr(Mi )
(5)
where
pr(D|Mi ) =

�

pr(D|θ(i) , Mi )pr(θ(i) |Mi )dθ(i)

5

(6)

is the integrated likelihood of model Mi with parameters θ(i) . The prior densities for parameters and models are pr(θ(i) |Mi ) and pr(Mi ), respectively.
Previous approaches that outline Bayesian instrumental variable methods are provided
by Geweke (1996) and Kleibergen and Zivot (2003). There is also a literature that attempts
to “derive” IV, in some cases using automatic, information-theory-based methods to avoid
explicit priors (see Kitamura and Stutzer (1997), Zellner et al. (1997), and Kim (2002)). Related work by Chao and Phillips (1998) pursues the use of Jeﬀreys priors, which are another
automatically generated class of priors.
We simplify matters below by using the BIC approximation to the integrated likelihood.
In general, Schwarz (1978) showed that
pr(D|Mi ) = log pr(D|θˆ(i) , Mi ) − (pZ,i + pX,i ) log n + O(1),

(7)

where pZ,i and pX,i are, respectively, the number of Z and X variables included in model
Mi . Furthermore, when a unit information prior is used the O(1) term may be replaced by
O(n−1/2 ); see Kass and Wasserman (1995) and Raftery (1995).
Under BMA, the posterior mean of θ is
θˆBM A =

I
�

πi θˆ(i) ,

(8)

i=1

which is the sum of the posterior means of each model in the collection M, weighted by their
posterior probabilities. Similarly, the posterior variance of the BMA estimate is calculated
as

σ

(θ) =
πi σ
ˆi +
πi θˆ(i) − θˆBM A .
(9)
i=1

i=1

This variance has a clear interpretation that highlights how model uncertainty is accounted
for in the standard errors by the BMA methodology. The first term is the weighted variance
for each model, σ
ˆi2 = V ar(θˆ(i) |Mi , D), averaged over all relevant models, and the second
term indicates how stable the estimates are across models. The more the estimates diﬀer
between models, the greater is the posterior variance.
The posterior distribution for a parameter is a mixture of a regular posterior distribution
and a point mass at zero, which represents the probability that the parameter equals zero.
The sum of the posterior probabilities of the models that contain the variable is called the
inclusion probability and can then be taken as a measure of the importance of a variable.
For instance, for instrument Zk we may write,
�
µBM A (θZk ) = pr(θˆZk �= 0|D) =
πi ,
(10)
i∈Mk

where Mk is collection of indices for which i ∈ Mk implies model Mi does not restrict the
parameter θZk to zero. Standard rules of thumb for interpreting µBM A have been provided
by Kass and Raftery (1995). They establish the following eﬀect thresholds: < 50% evidence
6

against the eﬀect, 50-75% weak evidence for the eﬀect, 75-95% positive evidence, 95-99%
strong evidence, and > 99% very strong evidence.
In the case of IV estimation in the presence of model uncertainty, the BMA framework
must be extended to account for the two stages in which estimation is performed. IVBMA
is a nested approach that first determines the posterior model probabilities in the first stage
according to the BMA methodology, determining both πi as well as w
˜i , the first-stage fitted
value according to model Mi , for all models in M. Denoting by L = {L1 , . . . , LJ } the set of
second stage models, IVBMA then uses the fitted value, w
˜i to derive second stage posterior
model probabilities, νj (w˜i ), and estimates, βˆ(j) (w˜i ) for each model Lj ∈ L. The IVBMA
estimate of β is calculated as
βˆIV BM A =

I �
J
�

πi νj (w˜i )βˆ(j) (w˜i ).

(11)

i=1 j=1

Equation 11 shows that the IVBMA estimate is formed as the average of each IV estimate
that results from using the combination of model Mi in the first stage and model Lj in the
second stage, weighted by both the first and second stage probabilities.
Furthermore, for the estimated variance we have the following result.
�
Theorem 1. Let βˆi∗ = Jj=1 νj (w˜i )β (j) (w˜i ) be the model averaged estimate of β for a fixed
first stage model Mi . Then the variance of the estimate βˆIV BM A is

is the BMA variance associated with second stage estimates for a fixed first stage model.
Proof See Appendix.
Theorem 1 shows that the variance of IVBMA estimates has a similar separation property to standard BMA variances, containing a part which is the average of BMA variances
associated with a single first stage model and another part that quantifies the variation in
the BMA estimates obtained by fixing a particular first stage model relative to the overall
IVBMA estimate.
The posterior distribution of βˆIV BM A is again a mixture of a regular posterior distribution
and a point mass at zero, which represents the probability that the parameter equals zero.
The sum of these posterior probabilities that contain the variable is then the inclusion

probability in the second stage, which indicates the importance of a variable. For instance,
for the variable Xl we may write,
µIV BM A (βXl ) = pr(βˆXl �= 0|D) =

I �
�

πi νj (w˜i ).

(14)

i=1 j∈Ll

Where Ll indicates the subset of L for which the coeﬃcient βXl is not constrained to zero.
We continue to follow the standard rules of thumb for interpreting eﬀect thresholds in the
second stage, as suggested by Kass and Raftery (1995).

2.2.1

Properties of IVBMA
Consistency of IVBMA

The driving motivation underlying IV estimation is the fact that, in the presence of endogeneity, IV estimates are consistent, in contrast to OLS estimates. This consistency is
retained by the IVBMA estimates.
Theorem 2. The IVBMA estimate is consistent, in that βˆIV BM A →p β.
Proof See Appendix.

2.2.2

Many Instrument Eﬃciency

In what is sometimes called the “many instruments” problem (Hall, 2005), IV estimates
become increasingly biased as the number of proposed instruments increases, especially when
these proposed instruments have little explanatory power on the endogenous variable. Sawa
(1969) derives this bias explicitly as6

The derivation of Sawa (1969) considers the case in which there are no exogenous covariates X and the

instruments Z are considered to be independently distributed, but includes an outline of the straightforward
updates necessary to incorporate additional covariates and dependence between X and Z. Our treatment
takes these additional factors into account, as they are central to the purpose of modeling multiple growth
theories.

(1995) show that the many instrument bias in standard IV regressions increases as τ 2 /K
decreases. As τ 2 is a function of the first stage regression coeﬃcients, we see that adding
instruments with no explanatory power on W leads to a decline in τ 2 /K, thereby creating
larger bias.
We now show that IVBMA mitigates the many instrument bias. Let Bij denote the
bias of the estimate βˆ(j) (w˜i ) from model Mi in the first stage and Lj in the second stage.
Also define B∗∗ the bias from βˆ2SLS , equivalent to using the full models in both the first
and second stages. Provided model Mi excludes some X or Z covariates, but contains at
least one valid instrument from Z, it can be shown that Bij ≤ B∗∗ , which implies that
IVBMA will mitigate any many instruments problem that may have existed in the standard
IV procedure.

Theorem 3. The bias of βˆIV BM A is less than or equal to βˆ2SLS provided that each first-stage
model Mi with πi > 0 contains as least one valid instrument.
Proof. See Appendix.

2.3

Bayesian Tests of Assumption Validity

As mentioned above, the IV framework requires the proposed instrument set to be conditionally independent of the variable Y and presumes that the instruments have some
explanatory power on the endogenous variables W . Various tests have been developed to
verify these assumptions, most notably the over-identification test of Sargan (1958) and the
under-identification test of Cragg and Donald (1993) which Stock and Yogo (2002) use to
propose a weak instruments test. In this section we show how model averaged versions of
these tests can be used in the IVBMA framework to verify model assumptions and discuss
the properties of such techniques.
2.3.1

A Bayesian Test of Over-identification

The most important assumption in IV regressions is that the instrument condition is satisfied,
namely that the instrument is exogenous, E(η|Z) = 0, and that the instrument is relevant
Cov(Z, W ) �= 0. To allow for an examination of whether these conditions are satisfied in the
IVBMA context, we present a Bayesian over-identification test of the exogeneity assumption
that provides similar information to that provided by the Sargan (1958) test for the standard
IV procedure. Our test proceeds in a manner similar to the Sargan test, but is conducted at
the model level and then averaged using model probabilities.
Let ηˆij be the residuals from the combination of models Mi and Lj and let pij be the
total number of X and Z included in this combination. Note that the Sargan p-value S ∗ is
9

2
2
calculated as S ∗ = pr(nR∗∗
> χ2pX +pZ −1 ) where R∗∗
is the R2 associated with the regression
of ηˆ2SLS on all X and Z variables. Just as in the Sargan test, we can then consider the
regression of ηˆij on the subset of the variables X and Z that belong to either Mi or Lj and
2
2
determine Rij
, the R2 associated with this regression. Letting Sij = p(χ2pij −1 > nRij
), we
define the Bayesian Sargan p-value to be

S

IV BM A

=

I �
J
�

πi νj (w˜i )Sij .

(16)

i=1 j=1

S IV BM A is therefore the average of the Sargan p-values derived from the specific models Mi
and Lj , weighted by their respective posterior probabilities.
The benefit of the Bayesian Sargan test is that it eﬀectively mitigates the reduction in
power that the traditional Sargan test experiences as the dimension of the X or Z variables
grows. This increase in power can be marked, as shown in the simulation study below.

2.3.2

Bayesian Tests of Under-Identification and Weak Instruments

While it is crucial to verify that none of the proposed instruments violates the conditional
independence assumption, it is also important to test that they have an appropriate level
of explanatory power on the endogenous W . When W is univariate, this may be done by
considering an F test based on the first stage. However, when pW > 1, Cragg and Donald
(1993) derive an equivalent test and test statistic to help verify this claim. Here we derive a
Bayesian analog of this test.
Consider fixed first and second stage models, Mi and Lj respectively, and let Zij be
the instruments used in this combination (thus all those variables in Z used in Mi and
those variables X used in Mi but excluded from Lj ) and let Xj be those X contained
in Lj . Let Vij be the matrix of all X and Z variables included in either Mi or Lj . Define
PVij ≡ Vij (Vij� Vij )−1 Vij� and MVij ≡ In −PVij where In is the n×n identity matrix, and similarly
ˆ −1/2 Θij Σ
ˆ −1/2
define PXj ≡ Xj (Xj� Xj )−1 Xj� and MXj = In − PXj , and finally define Gij ≡ Σ
ij
ij
ˆ ij = W � MV W and Θij = (MX W )� MX Zij ((MX Zij )� MX Zij )−1 (MX Zij )� MX W .
where Σ
ij
j
j
j

The Cragg and Donald statistic under model Mi and Lj can then be derived as the minimum
eigenvalue of Gij , gij = min eigenGij .
In practice, the statistic gij is used in two ways. Asymptotically, under the null hypothesis
of under-identification, ngij ∼ χ2pZ −1 , and this reference distribution is used to derive a pij
value. Here we propose a Bayesian model-averaged version of this p-value by considering
CD =

I �
J

πi νj (w˜i )pr(χ2pZ

(17)

A second use of gij was suggested by Stock and Yogo (2002), but their test statistic provides only critical values, not p-values that one can average over when models have diﬀerent
10

numbers of instruments. The apparent weakness of an instrument can, however, be directly
assessed in a Bayesian way, using the inclusion probabilities in the first stage.

Simulation Study

We conduct a simulation study to show the estimation properties of IVBMA, as well as the
behavior of the Bayesian over-identification test. In the following we consider a framework
in which there are ten variables in Z, fifteen in X and W is univariate. We set βX1 = βX2 =
βW = 1 and the remaining elements of β to zero. In the first stage, we set θZ1 = θZ2 = θX1 =
θX3 = 1 and the remaining elements of θZ and θX to zero.
Thus, we consider a situation in which two covariates along with W have explanatory
power on Y . Furthermore, two variables in Z serve as instruments, one of the variables of X
has explanatory power on both Y and W . Finally, one variable in X would be more properly
classified as an instrument, as it has explanatory power on W but not on Y . All variables
in X and Z are determined by independent draws from a N (0, 1) distribution.
We introduce endogeneity by drawing � from a N (0, 1) distribution and setting η = � + ξ,
with ξ drawn from a N (0, 1) distribution as well. We then consider two scenarios. The first
scenario is one in which the IV model is correctly specified, i.e. the Z covariates have no
eﬀect on Y . In the second scenario we consider a misspecified model in which η = Z1 + � + ξ,
so that the instrument condition fails. This framework leads to an R2 value of .89, which
is typical of data sets currently considered in the growth literature. In each scenario we
simulate datasets of 100 observations and consider 500 replicates. The simulation study is
structured to roughly resemble the growth data set we will be examining below.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the estimate of βW across replications using IVBMA,
2SLS and OLS. We see that the OLS estimates are centered about a value of 1.3. Indeed,
in this case the OLS estimate will asymptotically approach this value. Both IVBMA and
2SLS rectify this bias and are more closely centered about the true value of 1. However,
there is a distinct improvement in the quality of the estimator using IVBMA, evidence of
the finite-sample bias reduction property of IVBMA as discussed above. The average bias
of βˆW was 0.330, 0.047 and 0.021 for OLS, IV and IVBMA respectively. The average mean
squared error for estimating the entire vector β was 0.0399, 0.0244 and 0.0094 for OLS, IV
and IVBMA respectively. IVBMA performs substantially better than OLS or IV.
The first panel in Figure 3 shows the distribution of the p-values returned from the
Bayesian Sargan test as well as the traditional Sargan test. We see that the p-values from
the Bayesian Sargan test are much lower. However, these scores are still suﬃciently high
that the exogeneity assumption is unlikely to be incorrectly rejected.
The second panel in Figure 3 shows the resulting Bayesian Sargan and classical Sargan pvalues for the case of a misspecified exogeneity assumption. In the case of valid instruments,
the size of both tests was 0. However, in the case of invalid instruments the power of the
Bayesian Sargan test as 98%, whereas it was 0.2based on an α = .05. We clearly see that the

assumption and it is far more likely to reject the hypothesis that the IV assumptions are

Figure 2: Distribution of scores returned by the Bayesian Sargan test and the Sargan test
across replications when the IV assumptions hold (Valid) and when they do not (Invalid).
In the case of valid instruments, the size of both tests was 0. However, in the case of invalid
instruments the power of the Bayesian Sargan test as 98%, whereas it was 0.2% using the
traditional Sargan test.
The previous figures show that IVBMA returns appropriate coeﬃcient estimates and
features dramatically improved power at detecting assumption violations over traditional
methods. Table 1 shows that the technique also uncovers the pattern of interaction in both
stages of the estimation. When the model is correctly specified, Table 1 shows the mean
inclusion probability for each variable across the 500 replications in both stages. We see
that in the first stage the two variables in Z as well as the two variables in X are given
inclusion probabilities of essentially 1, while the remaining variables are given low inclusion
probabilities. This remains true in the second stage as well, where W and the two covariates
in X that have explanatory power are given inclusion probabilities of close to 1 and all others
are given low inclusion probabilities.

Instrument and Determinant Uncertainty in Development Accounting

We now apply IVBMA to a prominent dataset in the development accounting literature,
where Rodrik et al., (RST) provide an explicit “horse race” of theories that pertain not only
to development determinants (geography, integration and institutions), but also to a range of
theories that suggest alternative instruments to resolve the endogeneity of the determinants.
With less than 100 observations, the sample is a standard size of datasets in development
accounting. Model uncertainty among development determinants is a defining feature of the
literature and endogeneity is uniformly acknowledged to be rampant.
RST explored over 25 diﬀerent robustness specifications with alternative candidate regressors suggested by a range of theories. Based on this, they claimed to resolve model
uncertainty in a clear way. The claims of the paper are unambiguous and well captured by
the title “Institutions rule: the primacy of institutions over geography and integration in
economic development.” While the previous literature had provided evidence of Trade and
Geography eﬀects on development (e.g., Hall and Jones (1999), Sachs (2003)), RST found
that geography has at best weak direct eﬀects on incomes, and Integration is found to be
“always insignificant, and often enters the income equation with the ‘wrong’ sign.”
Using their data, we reexamine RST’s suggested robustness specifications to account for
the model and instrument uncertainty that RST highlight so forcefully. The IVBMA first
and second stages are reported in Tables 2 and 3. Geography is taken to be exogenous, so the
upper panel in Table 2 represents the first stage for the institutions proxy (Rule of Law) and
the lower panel is the first stage for Integration. Although it would be suﬃcient to present
only the IVBMA results that explore the entire model space spanned by RST’s determinants
and instruments, we also provide two intermediate stages. Column 1 represents RST’s “core
specification” (their Table 2) and Column 2 is the first set of robustness exercises that RST
introduce; it highlights the sensitivity of the core specification to even a slight increase in
model uncertainty.
Column 1 in Table 3 provides the second stage of RST’s preferred core specification
(RST’s Table 2). Both RST and IVBMA find that only Rule of Law shows an eﬀect and the
conditional posterior mean is nearly identical to RST’s 2SLS estimate. In this specification,
the IVBMA result confirms RST’s central finding that “the preferred specification accounts
for about half of the variance in incomes across the sample, with institutional quality (instrumented by settler mortality) doing most of the work.” The generalized R2 for the best
IVBMA model is 0.53 versus 0.55 in RST’s 2SLS approach.
Column 1 in Table 2 reports the IVBMA first stages for the core specification. They
broadly confirm the 2SLS results although the IVBMA suggests slightly more parsimonious
models. IVBMA suggests three strong instruments for Rule of Law (Settler Mortality, Latitude, and the Fraction Speaking English), while RST found significant coeﬃcients for all
five instruments across their various 2SLS exercises. This generates a slightly higher R2 for
RST’s preferred 2SLS specification (0.55) as compared to the best model in IVBMA (0.49).

16

For Integration, the IVBMA first stage suggests only two strong instruments (Implied Trade
Shares and Settler Mortality) while 2SLS produces statistically significant coeﬃcient for an
additional instrument (Fraction Speaking English). Nevertheless the R2 of the IVBMA best
model and of the 2SLS first stage are identical (0.58).
RST find that any core specifications with more than one instrument fails to pass the
Sargan test. This finding is confirmed by the Bayesian Sargan test in Column 1 of Table 3, which presents a similar p-value to that found by RST. One interpretation is that the
Sargan test undermines alternative determinant and instrument strategies as suggested by
RST. Others might argue that RST’s specifications do not contain the appropriate set of
instruments. We examine this issue further below but note that already at this stage, the
under-identification (as measured by the Bayes/Crag-Donald p-value) is easily rejected by
IVBMA (not reported in RST).
The 2SLS and IVBMA results in column 1 are nearly identical because the core specification includes minimal model uncertainty at the determinant level and only a fraction of
the standard instruments suggested by the development literature. Columns 2 and 3 in Tables 2 and 3 report the first and second stages for additional robustness exercises suggested
by RST. Column 2 adds regressors suggested by theories pertaining to Legal Origins and
Religion, as well as regional dummies, while column 3 represents the most comprehensive set
of regressors that adds standard covariates related to alternative Geography theories (most
notably Temperature, Malaria) as well as alternative Integration measures (such as Sea Access). As we allow for additional theories and the associated regressors, IVBMA results start
to diverge from the individual 2SLS regressions that juxtapose a particular theory against
another. In other words, the disparities across results become more pronounced and extend
beyond parsimony as model uncertainty increases.
IVBMA results that use the most comprehensive set of instruments and development
determinants (Column 3 in Tables 2 and 3), cast doubt on the strong primacy of institutions result. Instead IVBMA finds that the “horse race” ends in a statistical three-way tie
when model uncertainty is considered. Geography (as measured by Tropics), Institutions
and Integration are shown to be highly eﬀective development determinants. This result is
particularly surprising since Geography is only occasionally weakly significant in RST, while
Integration is never significant and often of the wrong sign. In IVBMA all three eﬀects are
strong and estimated with the correct sign. The results support the strong contentions of
Sachs (2003) and Alcal´a and Ciccone (2004) who report strong eﬀects of Geography and
Integration.
The divergence of 2SLS and IVBMA results originates in the first stages. 7 Most importantly, the Implied Trade Share no longer receives support as a strong instrument for
Integration. It is most strongly instrumented by EuroFrac in combination with the covariates PopGrowth, Oil, SeaAccess, Malaria94, EuroFrac, Tropics, Latitude, FrostArea, and
PolicyOpenness. In contrast to the findings of RST, religion variables also play an important part in the first stage regression. In particular, Catholic is given nearly a 90 percent
inclusion in the first stage for Rule of Law and above 50 percent in the first stage for Integra7

RST report neither first stages nor tests of instrument restrictions beyond the core specification.

17

tion. Similarly, the power of Settler Mortality as an instrument for Institutions is dominated
by regressors such as EuroFrac and Temperature variables in both first stages. The increase
in the model space of development determinants and instruments dramatically increases the
fit of the IVBMA first stage. The best models in both IVBMA first stages (column 3) report
R2 that is at least 40 percent greater than those found in the core specification.
This improvement in model fit is likewise observed in the second stage when considering
the generalized R2 (Pesaran and Smith, 1994) of the best model returned by IVBMA. In fact,
none of the top 100 models’ generalized R2 falls below .82, which greatly exceeds any model
presented by RST (whose highest generalized R2 is .73). IVBMA has therefore uncovered
combinations of instruments and growth determinants that fit the data substantially better
and therefore produce diﬀerent results in both the first and second stages than those presented in RST. These models confirm the strong eﬀect institutions have on growth, but also
suggest that the eﬀects of integration and geography cannot be ignored when instrument and
development determinant uncertainty is directly incorporated into the estimation strategy.
The Bayesian Sargan and Bayesian Cragg and Donald tests clearly show, respectively, that
over-identifcation is easily rejected with the improved set of instruments and that underidentification remains of no concern.

Conclusion

The recent development literature focuses not only on competing theories that suggest alternative development determinants, but also on a diﬀerent set of theories that motivate
instruments that may resolve the endogeneity between development determinants and development outcomes. We develop a methodology to address model uncertainty in the presence
of endogeneity and explore its properties as a valid IV estimator. The method is based on
Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), which has already been extensively used in economic
growth applications. IVBMA is a two step BMA procedure that is shown to be a consistent
methodology that also reduces many-instrument bias.
Instrumental variable estimation of any kind requires a number of assumptions that relate
to the identification of the implied structural model. To enable assumptions to be verified
in this setting we have proposed a new concept, that of model averaging Bayesian predictive
p-values within the IVBMA framework. As shown in the simulation study, by using model
averaged p-values we are able to reduce the eﬀect increasing dimension has on the power of
the proposed tests, while not aﬀecting the size in any substantive manner.
We conclude our study by applying IVBMA to the dataset of Rodrik et al. (2004),
who motivate their paper by the diversity of alternative theories of development and clearly
outline the associated model uncertainty. Instead of resolving the model uncertainty in a
horse race of alternative regressions, we use the formal IVBMA approach. We find not only
support for institutions, but also substantial support for geographic and trade factors, once
model uncertainty in the presence of endogeneity is addressed. The latter two eﬀects had
been relegated to second order eﬀects by RST.
Among the number of potential implementations of the Bayesian model selection paradigm,
we have chosen to focus on augmenting the BMA methodology outlined in Raftery (1995)
and Raftery (1996) to accommodate the IV estimation problem. We made this particular
choice because this methodology has become familiar to a broad range of econometricians
and statisticians and has proven robust to the needs of applied researchers. However, recent research into the use of BMA in the development determinant literature has suggested
several modifications of this paradigm that may help rectify the particulars of growth data
with the goal of testing the strength of various growth theories. In particular, Brock et al.
(2003) and Durlauf et al. (2008) discuss priors on the model space that account for the
fact that many variables may be collected to proxy one particular theory, while fewer may
be available to proxy an alternative theory. Ley and Steele (2007) and Doppelhofer and
Weeks (2009) develop metrics to quantify the degree to which development determinants act
“jointly” to aﬀect growth. Determining how these extensions of the BMA paradigm may be
taken into account in the IVBMA framework would help extend the application of IVBMA
to the particular problem of testing growth theory robustness.
The IVBMA method allows researchers to incorporate concepts of model uncertainty and
model averaging into the assessment of a diverse range of economic behavior where observations are subject to endogeneity. However, the current framework does not directly handle
such concepts as panel data, mixed eﬀects, random coeﬃcient models, and heteroskadasticity. Future research into these areas will improve the applicability of the BMA framework
21

to economic analysis, in growth economics and beyond.

Proof of Theorem 1: Note that using the standard BMA results, the variance of βˆIV BM A can
be written as

which results since

as desired.
Proof of Theorem 2: For convenience, suppose that M1 ∈ M is the true model for the
first stage. Then,
π1 →p 1 and πj →p 0, j �= 1 as n → ∞.
(A-7)
by the consistency of BIC. Furthermore, suppose that L1 ∈ L is the true second stage model.
Then,
ν1 (w˜1 ) →p 1 and νj (w˜1 ) →p 0, j �= 1 as n → ∞.

Therefore,
βˆIV BM A =

Finally consider βˆ2SLS . We know that βˆ2SLS →p β by the consistency of the technique.
Furthermore, since the first and second stage estimates of 2SLS are individually consistent
we have βˆ2SLS →p βˆ(1) (w˜1 ) provided M1 and L1 are the true first and second stage models.
Thus, βˆ(1) (w˜1 ) →p β, showing the technique is consistent.
