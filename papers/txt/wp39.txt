Abstract
This paper presents recent advances in the statistical modeling of random graphs that have an impact on the empirical study of social networks. Statistical exponential family models (Wasserman
and Pattison 1996) are a generalization of the Markov random graph models introduced by Frank
and Strauss (1986), which in turn are derived from developments in spatial statistics (Besag 1974).
These models recognize the complex dependencies within relational data structures. A major barrier to the application of random graph models to social networks has been the lack of a sound
statistical theory to evaluate model fit. This problem has at least three aspects: the specification of
realistic models, the algorithmic difficulties of the inferential methods, and the assessment of the
degree to which the graph structure produced by the models matches that of the data. We discuss
these and related issues of the model degeneracy and inferential degeneracy for commonly used
estimators.

1. INTRODUCTION
Networks are a useful device to represent “relational data”, that is, data with properties beyond
the attributes of the individuals (nodes) involved. Relational data arise in many social science
fields and graphical models are a natural approach to representing the regular pattern of the relations between nodes. In typical applications, the nodes in a graph represent individuals, and the
ties (edges) represent a specified relationship between individuals. Nodes can also be used to represent larger social units (groups, families, organizations), objects (airports, servers, locations), or
abstract entities (concepts, texts, tasks, random variables). This framework has many applications,
including the structure of social networks, the dynamics of epidemics, the interconnectedness of
the WWW, and long-distance telephone calling patterns.
We consider here stochastic models for such graphs. These models attempt to represent the
stochastic mechanisms that produce ties, and the complex dependencies this induces. Collectively,
the class of models we consider form a statistical exponential family (Strauss and Ikeda 1990).
This class has been referred to as the “ p ∗ ” class of models in the psychology and sociology literatures (Wasserman and Pattison 1996). Given their general nature and applicability, we shall
refer to them simply as exponentially parametrized random graph models, and note that in their
general form they can represent any finite random graph model. There is a growing literature on
these models – see Snijders (2002); Wasserman and Robins (2004). A natural sub-class of these
are the Markov random graph models introduced by Frank and Strauss (1986). Exponentially
parametrized random graph models have connections to a broad array of literatures in many fields,
and here we emphasize its links to spatial statistics, statistical exponential families, log-linear models, and statistical physics.
Historically, exploration of the properties of these graphical models has been limited by three
factors. First, the complexity of realistic models has limited the insight that can be obtained using
analytical methods. Second, statistical methods for stochastic simulation from general random
graph models have only recently been developed (Crouch et al. 1998; Corander and Dahmstrom
1998; Snijders 2002). Because of this, the properties of general models have not been explored in
depth though simulation studies. Third, the properties of statistical methods for estimating model
parameters based on observed networks have been poorly understood. The models and parameter
values relevant to real networks is therefore largely unknown.
In this paper we examine the nature and properties of graphical models for social networks
by extending methods for the stochastic simulation of, and inference for, random graphs. The
approach builds on the work of Geyer and Thompson (1992).
Our main contribution is to address a persistent obstacle to applied work in this area: the
problem of inferential degeneracy. Effective inferential strategies for general random graph models
depend upon the use of Monte Carlo quadrature (Kalos and Whitlock, 1986) to estimate likelihood
1

values; efficient computation for such quadratures generally requires the use of Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Many previous attempts to develop MCMC-based estimation for
Markov graph models have found that the algorithms nearly always converge to degenerate graphs
– graphs that are either empty or complete – or that the algorithms do not converge consistently.
Using statistical exponential family theory, we show that this is a function of the form of the model
and algorithm used.
In the next section we review the statistical theory of social network models expressed in exponential form. In Section 3, we consider forms of inference for the parameters of the models with
focus on psuedolikelihood and likelihood-based approaches. In Section 4 we review the geometry
of random graph models, and in Section 5 use this to define a form of model degeneracy, a related
form of inferential degeneracy, and some possible solutions. In Section 6 we illustrate these results
using a simple random graph model that captures pair dependency.
2. RANDOM GRAPH MODELS
Let the random matrix X represent the adjacency matrix of an unvalued graph on n individuals.
We assume that the diagonal elements of X are 0 – that self-partnerships are disallowed. Suppose
that X denotes the set of all possible graphs on the given n individuals. The multivariate distribution
of X can be parameterized in the form:


exp θ T t (x)
Pθ,X (X = x) =
x ∈X
(1)
c(θ, X)
where θ ∈ 2 ⊆ IRq is the model parameter and t : X → IRq are statistics based on the adjacency matrix (Strauss and Ikeda 1990). There is an extensive literature on descriptive statistics for
networks (Wasserman and Faust 1994; Borgatti et al. 1999). These statistics are often crafted to
capture features of the network (e.g., transitivity, clustering, mutuality and betweenness) of primary
substantive interest to the researcher. Often such substantive considerations cause the researcher
to have a specific set of statistics in mind; the above model then has the property of maximizing
the entropy within the family of all distributions with given expectation of t (X ). Paired with the
flexibility of the choice of t this property does provide some justification for the model (1) that will
vary from application to application.
The denominator c(θ, X) is the normalizing function that ensures the distribution sums to one:


P
c(θ, X) =
exp θ T t (y) . This factor varies with both θ and the support X and is the primary
y∈X

barrier to inference under this modeling scheme. We specify a model via the triple (X, t, θ).
Let C be the convex hull of {t (x) : x ∈ X}. Note that X contains at most N = 2n(n−1)
graphs so that the distributions in (1) form a statistical exponential model for the underlying finite
exponential family of probability distributions with respect to counting measure on X. We assume
2

that the dimension of X is q so that the family is minimal and the parameter space is {θ : c(θ, X) <
∞} = IRq so that it is also full. Although this is the most common situation for social network
models, the results below hold with minimal changes if the parameter space is chosen to be a
relatively open subset of IRq . In the remainder we will suppress the reference to X. The dimension
of 2 is at most N − 1 (for the “saturated” model), although it is typically much smaller than this.
An alternative specification of the model (1) clarifies the interpretation of the parameters. Let I
be the set of indices of the unique elements of X, X icj = {X kl : kl ∈ I/{i j}}, xicj = {xkl : kl ∈ I/{i j}},
xi+j = {xicj ∪ {xi j = 1}}, and xi−j = {xicj ∪ {xi j = 0}}. Thus, X icj represents all elements in the
graph excluding X i j while xi+j and xi−j represent the graph x altered so that xi j equal to 1 and 0,
respectively. The full conditional distributions of X i j are
logit[Pθ (X i j = 1|X icj = xicj )] = θ T δ(xicj )

x ∈X

(2)

where δ(xicj ) = t (xi+j ) − t (xi−j ) (Strauss and Ikeda 1990). The statistic δ(xicj ) is the change in the
graph statistics when xi j changes from 0 to 1. Hence θ can be interpreted as the increase in the full
conditional log-odds of a partnership between individuals i and j induced by the formation of the
tie, conditional on all other ties remaining unchanged. In the homogeneous Bernoulli graph, for
example, θ is the common log-odds of individual tie formation.
The most commonly used class of random graph models assume Markov dependence in the
sense of Frank and Strauss (1986). For these models, dyads that do not share an individual are
conditionally independent; this is an idea analogous to the nearest neighbor concept in spatial
statistics. Typically a homogeneity condition is also added: all isomorphic graphs have the same
probability under the model.
3. INFERENTIAL DEGENERACY FOR RANDOM GRAPH MODELS
Developing inference within a likelihood framework has the advantage of being able to draw
upon a statistical theory for closely related models in statistical physics and spatial statistics (Besag
1975; Geyer and Thompson 1992; Geyer 1999). Direct calculation of the log-likelihood:
L(θ ; x) ≡ log [Pθ (X = x)] = θ T t (x) − κ(θ)

x ∈X

(3)

where κ(θ) = log[c(θ)], by enumerating X is infeasible for graphs of more than 30 individuals.
Because of these computational difficulties, alternative means of approximating the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) for θ :
θˆ = argmaxθ∈2 Pθ (X = xobser ved |t, X)

(4)

have been suggested. Frank (1971) and Frank and Strauss (1986) consider (linear) approximations
to the cumulant generating function:
C(ψ) = log E [ψt (X )]
3

as a means to solve the likelihood equations
Eθ [t (X )] = t (xobser ved )

(5)

where Eθ (·) is the expectation under Pθ . Unfortunately, this approach is generally difficult to apply
to general multiparameter models unless supplemented by a means of simulation from the same
network model (Corander and Dahmstrom 1998). Snijders (2002) considers stochastic approximation algorithms that attempt this. Until recently inference for the model (1) has be almost exclusively based on a local alternative to the likelihood function referred to as the pseudolikelihood
(Strauss and Ikeda 1990). This was originally motivated by (and developed for) spatial models by
Besag (1975). The pseudolikelihood for model (1) is algebraically identical to the likelihood for a
logistic regression of the unique elements of the adjacency matrix on the design matrix with ith row
δ(xicj ) (See (2)). The value of the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator can then be expediently
found by using logistic regression as a computational device. Importantly, the value of the maximum likelihood estimator for the logistic regression will also be the maximum pseudolikelihood
estimator. Note, however, that the other characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimator do
not necessarily carry over. In particular, the standard errors of the estimates of θ from the logistic
regression will not be appropriate for the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator (MPLE). While
in common use (Wasserman and Pattison 1996; Anderson et al. 1999), the statistical properties of
pseudolikelihood estimators for social networks are only partially understood.
3.1 Existence and uniqueness of MPLE
One concern with the maximum psuedolikelihood algorithm is that it produces infinite values
even in situations where the psuedolikelihood converges. As it is usually assumed that all parameters are finite this is undesirable. If the MPLE does not exist then the estimates produced by
software are determined by the precise convergence characteristics of the algorithm. As such, the
estimates are arbitrary and misleading.
We now give a precise description of the existence and uniqueness of the MPLE for social
network models.
Result:
1. A necessary and sufficient condition for the MPLE to exist (i.e., to be finite) is: ∀α ∈
IRq , ∃i, j such that
(2xi j − 1)α T δ(xicj ) ≤ 0
This occurs with positive probability.
2. If the MPLE exists, it is unique. In addition, when it exists, it can be found as the unique

4

solution to psuedolikelihood equations:
X
X
xi j πi, j =
xi j δ(xicj )
i, j

i, j

where logit(πi, j ) = θ T δ(xicj ).
The condition (1) has a simple interpretation: The MPLE exists unless a separating hyperplane
exists between the scatterplot of the ties and non-ties in the space defined by the δ(xicj ). This
behavior is referred to as “separation” when the model is logistic regression (Albert and Anderson
1984; Santner and Duffy 1986).
Heinze and Schemper (2002) suggest, in the context of logistic regression, a penalized likelihood approach. For social networks, we can consider a penalized psuedolikelihood using Jeffreys
invariant prior as the penalty function (Heinze and Schemper 2002; Firth 1993). Under this modification the estimates will be finite and may reduce the bias of order O(N −1 ).
3.2 Existence and uniqueness of MLE
Many properties of the MLE can be derived from statistical exponential family theory (BarndorffNielsen 1978). Denote the relative interior of C by rint(C) and the relative boundary by rbd(C) =
cl(C)\rint(C).
Result:
1. The MLE exists if, and only if, t (xobser ved ) ∈ rint(C)
2. If it exists, it is unique. In addition, when it exists, it can be found as the unique solution to
(5) or, equivalently, as (4), the unique local minima of (3).
3. A necessary and sufficient condition for the MLE not to exist is that t (xobser ved ) ∈ rbd(C).
This occurs with positive probability.
In practice, the above implies that attempting to numerically maximize the likelihood leads
to unbounded estimates when the observed graph has statistics falling on rbd(C). This typically
means the optimization algorithm does not converge, or otherwise converges to a false maxima.
Simulation studies by Handcock (2000), Snijders (2002); Snijders et al. (2004) show that this is
a common occurrence as many realistic models have a non-negligible probability of falling on
rbd(C).
If t (xobser ved ) falls in rbd(C) it is still possible that subsets of θ have MLEs that exist. Let
t (xobser ved ) = (t (1) (xobser ved ), t (2) (xobser ved )) and θ = (θ (1) , θ (2) ) be similar partitions of t (xobser ved )
and θ. Under mild conditions (Barndorff-Nielsen 1978), if t (1) (xobser ved ) ∈ rbd(C) and t (2) (xobser ved )
is in the relative interior of the convex hull of t (X ) : t (1) (X ) = t (1) (xobser ved ) then the MLE of
θ (2) exists and is the unique local minima of the conditional likelihood equation:
5

CL(θ ; x, ) ≡ log [Pθ (X = x | ta (X ) = ta (xobser ved )] = θ T tb (x) − κ(θ, ta (xobser ved ))
x ∈ X : ta (X ) = ta (xobser ved )

(6)

Thus, it may be possible to obtain estimates for certain model parameters despite difficulties
with the overall model. This may provide a fall-back for certain atypical scenarios in which models
fail despite being well-behaved in general (e.g., due to chance realizations of extreme values of
t (xobser ved ) in small graphs).
3.3 Likelihood-based inference based on MCMC Algorithms
Geyer and Thompson (1992) show how MCMC methods can be used to approximate the likelihood for the random graph model (1). The basic idea is that c(θ, X) can be thought of as the mean


of exp θ T t (X ) . One way determine to c(θ, X) is to enumerate all graphs in X. As is well-known,
an alternative is to randomly sample from X and use the (weighted) mean of the sample as an estimate of c(θ, X) : Let y (1) , . . . , y (M) be a sequence of graphs sampled from the model (X, t, ψ). A
natural Monte Carlo estimate of c(θ, X) is
M

c(ψ, X) X (θ −ψ)T t (y (i) )
c M (θ, X) =
e
M
i=1

and the corresponding Monte Carlo log-likelihood:
MCL(θ ; x, ψ) = (θ − ψ)T t (x) + log

"M
X

e

(θ −ψ)T t (y (i) )

#
+ log M

i=1

converges almost surely to the (relative) log-likelihood L(θ ; x) − L(ψ; x) = (θ − ψ)T t (x) +
κ(ψ, X)−κ(θ, X). The MLE of θ can then be approximated by: θˆMC = argmaxθ ∈2 MCL(θ ; xobser ved , ψ),
the Monte Carlo MLE (MC-MLE). Geyer and Thompson (1992) prove that the MC-MLE converges to the true MLE as the number of simulations increases. The procedure also produces
estimates of the asymptotic covariance matrix, the size of the MCMC induced error, and other
related quantities.
The existence and uniqueness of the MC-MLE can be understood in terms of the statistical
exponential family with respect to counting measure on {t (y (1) ), . . . , t (y (M) )}.
Result: Let CO be the convex hull of {t (y (1) ), . . . , t (y (M) )}. There are three situations:
1. If t (xobser ved ) ∈ rint(CO) the MC-MLE exists and is unique. It is found as the unique
maximum of the MCMC likelihood.
2. If t (xobser ved ) ∈ rint(C) ∩ (rint(CO))c then the MC-MLE does not exist, even though MLE
exists and is unique.
6

3. If t (xobser ved ) 6∈ rint(C) then neither the MC-MLE nor the MLE exists.
This result further clarifies why attempts to calculate MC-MLE estimates for social network
models often fail. If the model used to simulate the graphs is not close enough to produce realizations that cover the observed values of the statistics, the MC-MLE will not exist even in cases
where the MLE does. This behavior is quite common (Crouch et al. 1998; Snijders 2002). As
we shall see in Section 5, this effect is magnified by properties of commonly used models that
do not place probability mass broadly enough. Thus, the MC-MLE may not exist for at least two
reasons. First, the MLE itself may not exist (in which case neither does the MC-MLE). Second,
it is difficult to specify parameter values for commonly used models to produce realizations that
cover the observed values of the network statistics – when the importance sample fails to cover
these values, the MC-MLE will not exist. This second problem is complementary to the Monte
Carlo estimation error: small to moderate disparities between Pψ (X = y) and Pθˆ (X = y) lead to
inaccurate estimation, with larger disparities causing the complete failure of the algorithm.
4. GEOMETRY OF EXPONENTIALLY PARAMETRIZED RANDOM GRAPH MODELS
The exponentially parametrized random graph models have almost exclusively been analyzed
within the natural θ −parametrization. In this section we establish the geometry of two alternative
parameterizations of model (1) that are usually superior for social networks.
Consider the mean value parametrization for the model (X, t, θ), µ : 2 → rint(C) defined by
µ(θ ) = Eθ [t (X )]

(7)

The mapping is strictly increasing in the sense that
(θa − θb )T (µ(θa ) − µ(θb )) ≥ 0

(8)

with equality only if Pθa (X = x) = Pθb (X = x) ∀x. The mapping is also injective in the sense
that
µ(θa ) = µ(θb ) → Pθa (X = x) = Pθb (X = x) ∀x.

(9)

Using (1), µ(θ ) can be reexpressed as

∂κ(θ )
(θ)
µ(θ ) =
∂θ

(10)


∂ 2 κ(θ )
(θ)
ν(θ ) =
∂θ T ∂θ

(11)



and has gradient


The range of µ, µ(2), is rint(C) (Barndorff-Nielsen 1978). Taken together, this means that
(7) is an alternative parameterization of (X, t, θ). We refer to it as the µ−parametization.
7

The µ−parametization has many advantages. Chief among these is interpretability. As noted
in Section 2, researchers choose graph statistics t (x) because they have meaning in the substantive context. The parameter corresponding to each graph statistic is just its expected value over
the population of graphs. For many parameters, this population-average interpretation has great
intuitive appeal. The µ−parameter space is finite and convex, and the points in the space have an
interpretable scale.
A natural measure of the divergence of the model (X, t, µ0 ) from (X, t, µ) is the KullbackLeibler discriminant information:
X


KL(µ0 ; µ) =
log Pµ,X (X = x)/Pµ0 ,X (X = x) Pµ,X (X = x) = (θ(µ)−θ(µ0 ))T µ+κ(µ0 )−κ(µ)
x∈X

As

∂KL(µ0 ; µ)
∂KL(θ0 ; θ)
= ν −1 (θ (µ))(µ0 − µ)
= ν(θ)(θ0 − θ)
(12)
∂µ0
∂θ0
we see that small changes on the µ−parametrization may lead to large-scale divergence while
those in the θ −parametrization are bounded. These issues are illustrated in the next sections.
In the case where a sub-set of the statistics are most directly interpretable in terms of their
mean values and others in their natural parametrization we can consider mixed parametizations.
Let (t (1) , t (2) ) be a partition of t such that the first component is that of the statistics interpretable
in terms of their mean values. Consider similar partitions (θ (1) , θ (2) ) of θ and (µ(1) (θ), µ(2) (θ))
of µ(θ). Let 2(2) be the set of values of θ (2) for θ varying in 2 and C (1) be the convex hull of
{t (1) (x) : x ∈ X}. The mapping η : 2 → 2(2) × rint(C(1) ) defined by
η(θ) = (µ(1) (θ), θ (2) )

(13)

represents a third parametization of the model (X, t, θ) (Barndorff-Nielsen 1978). The parametrization has similar properties to the mean value parametrization. In addition it has the important property that the components µ(1) and θ (2) are variationally independent, that is, the range of η(θ ) is a
product space. We refer to it as the η−parametization.
For many random graph models the η−parametization has the advantages of interpretability
and better inferential properties than the natural or mean value parameterizations.
4.1 Estimation in General Parametizations
Let ξ be one of the three parameterizations of the model (X, t, θ). Let κ(ξ ) = log[c(θ (ξ ))]
where θ(ξ ) is the inverse mapping of ξ(θ ). The log-likelihood function:


L(ξ ; x) ≡ log Pθ (ξ ) (X = x) = θ(ξ )T t (x) − κ(ξ )

x ∈X

(14)

is continuous in ξ and satisfies

where Vξ T is the variance of t (X ) considered as a function of ξ . In addition, if t ∈ rint(C) the
observed information at the MLE ξˆ is
∂ 2 L(ξ ; x)
−
(ξˆ ) = I(ξˆ ) = Vξˆ [t (X )])
∂ξ T ∂ξ

(16)

where I(ξ ) is the Fisher information. The Fisher information for the θ−parametrization is ν(θ) =
Vθ [t (X )] while that of the µ−parametrization is ν −1 (θ).
The Fisher information of the η−parametrization has additional structure. Based on the identity:
∂ 2 θ (1)
∂ 2 L(η; x)
(1)
(1)
(η) = (t (x) − µ ) ·
(17)
∂µ(1)T ∂θ (2)

the information is
 −1

[ν (θ)]11 0

[ν(θ)]22
where the diagonal blocks are the corresponding components of the information for µ(1) and θ (2) ,
respectively. Thus the components of the η−parametrization are orthogonal, and the corresponding
MLEs are asymptotically independent. These two properties enhance the interpretation of the
η−parametrization and simplify inference.
It is possible to enlarge the model (1) to include the distributions corresponding to the faces of
C (Barndorff-Nielsen 1978, p.154-155). In this extended model, the MLE of µ, µˆ = t (xobser ved ),
always exists and is unique. While no direct calculation of the likelihood equation is necessary to
calculate the MLE, measuring the uncertainty of the MLE as an estimate of µ is as computationally
complex as finding the MLE of θ.
The MLE of η can be determined in two stages. The MLE of µ(1) is clearly t (1) (xobser ved ). The
MLE of θ (2) can be found from the conditional likelihood equation (6). If this is estimated based
on an MCMC then in general it will be simpler than an overall MCMC as the proposal function
can be restricted to graphs with the observed value of t (1) .
For all three parameterizations, an MCMC or analytic approximation is required to determine
ˆ
ν(θ).
These results provide insight into the failure of the MLE algorithms in the natural parametrization noted in Section (3.3).
5. MODEL DEGENERACY FOR RANDOM GRAPH MODELS
In this section we consider the relationship between the geometry of the parametrization and
the properties of the model. Two properties of random graph models that have a big impact on
practice are model degeneracy and stability. This builds on ideas of Ruelle (1969), Strauss (1986),
Geyer (1999) and Baddeley (2001, Section 4).
9

5.1 What makes a useful model for a social network?
The specifics of what makes a useful model for a social network depends on the application.
Here we consider a basic statistical property that any useful model should have. Broadly speaking,
useful stochastic models place a significant proportion of their probability mass on graphs that
have high probability of being produced by the underlying social process. Heuristically, model
degeneracy occurs when the model places disproportionate probability mass on only a few of the
possible graph configurations in X. A common case is where the random graph model (X, t, θ)
places almost all its mass on the empty graph (i.e., X i j = 0 ∀i, j and/or the complete graph (i.e.,
X i j = 1 ∀i, j). Such models are almost never useful for modeling actual networks, as almost all
realizations from these models will be empty or complete. While it may be true that some social
structures are nearly always empty or complete this invariance also means that these are rarely
the subject of network analysis. Another complication caused by model degeneracy is that when
such models are used for simulation and MC-likelihood inference, the approximations to the true
model will generally be very poor. Thus, for most applications, we seek (X, t, θ) which are far
from degenerate and we seek to limit our space of viable models accordingly.
Specifically, we say a model (X, t, θ ) is near degenerate if µ(θ) is close to the boundary of the
convex hull of C. Let deg(X) = {x ∈ X : t (x) ∈ rbd(C)} be the set of graph on the boundary
of the convex hull. Based on the geometry of the mean value parametrization this means that the
expected sufficient statistics are close to a boundary of the hull and the model will place much
probability mass on graphs in deg(X). This statement can be quantified in a number of ways:
Result: Let e be a unit vector in IRq and bd(e) = supµ∈rint(C) (e T µ).
1. µ(λe) → bd(e)e as λ ↑ ∞.
2. Pλe,X (X ∈ deg(X)) → 1 as λ ↑ ∞.
3. For every d < bd(e), Pλe,X (e T t (X ) ≤ d) → 0 as λ ↑ ∞.
4. Let θ0 ∈ rint(C). Then KL(θ0 ; λe) → ∞ as λ ↑ ∞.
As µ(θ ) approaches the boundary the corresponding model places more and more probability
mass on the graphs that form the corresponding part of the boundary. The limiting model is singular
with respect to models with µ(θ ) ∈ rint(C) and places positive probability on the small subset of
graphs in the corresponding face of C. The last result indicates that near degenerate models diverge
in the Kullback-Leibler sense from models which are not.
In practice, the proportion of the population of graphs in deg(X) is small. Often the models
place the majority of mass on the empty graph, the complete graph or a mixture of the two.
These issues are exacerbated in the natural parametization due to the complexity of the mapping
µ(θ). Typically only a small section of the natural parameter space is mapped to areas of rint(C) far
10

from the boundary. As a result it is difficult to specify models in the natural parameter space. The
set of realistic social network models often form one-dimensional curves in the natural parameter
space of models that are surrounded by near degenerate models. We illustrate these issues using
the 2−star model in the next section.
A random graph model is stable if small changes in the parameter values result in small changes
in the probabilistic structure of the model. If this is not the case, then very similar parameter values
can describe very different graph structures. Unstable models often have bad statistical properties
do not represent realistic graphs. Conditions for the stability of a model are related to those for
model degeneracy. The stability of model within the mean value parametrization is geometrically
simpler than that of the natural parametrization: if the model is unstable if it is close to rbd(C).
5.2 The Effect of Model Degeneracy on MCMC Estimation
The effects of model degeneracy are exacerbated because it is closely related to poor properties
of simple MCMC schemes (Geyer 1999). The results of the previous section along with those of
Section 3 clarify why attempts to calculate MC-MLE estimates for social network models often
fail. Parameter values in the near degenerate region can hinder the convergence of common MCMC
algorithms used to simulate and estimate random graph models. This has hindered likelihoodbased inference for random graph models. A common symptom of these difficulties has been
non-convergence of the algorithms (Crouch et al. 1998; Snijders 2002). Specifically, if the MCMC
is based on a near degenerate model then the convex hull of the sampled statistics will be a small
subset of the convex hull of the model. According to the results of Section 3.3, the MC-MLE will
have very high variance and usually will not exist. The reason is that it is very difficult to choose
values of the natural parameter that are far from degenerate and close to the MLE.
Consider the simple MCMC algorithm based on the full-conditional distributions and the random proposal of dyads to update. Let
M(ψ) = max |ψ T δ(xicj )|
x∈X

where δ(xicj ) is given in (2). Thus there exists x ∈ X with .
h
i
logit Pψ,X (X i j = 1 | X icj = xicj ) = ±M(ψ)
If M(ψ) is large and the chain transitions to this graph then it will not mix over X very well.
This is true even though the MCMC is geometrically ergodic. However, as µ(ψ) → rbd(C),
M(ψ) → ∞. Hence if ψ is near-degenerate then M(ψ) will often be large and the will have poor
coverage of X. A common occurrence with social network models has M(ψ) determined by the
complete graph, and the MCMC unable to move away from it.

6. CASE-STUDY OF DEGENERACY OF THE 2−STAR MODEL
In this section we illustrate the ideas in the previous section using a simple model that is commonly used as a starting point for social network analysis. It is the instance of the model (1) with
two network statistics being the number of edges and 2−stars in the graph. This is the case of
model (1) with q = 2 statistics
exp{θ1 E(x) + θ2 S(x)}
c(θ1 , θ2 )
X
E(x) ≡ t1 (x) =
xi j

Pθ (X = x) =

x ∈X

i< j

S(x) ≡ t2 (x) =

X

xi j xik

i< j<k

where E(x) is the number of edges and S(x) is the number of “2−stars” (i.e., edges sharing a
common node). We shall refer to this as the 2-star model. While it only has two parameters it can
represent the full degree distribution of a graph. This model modifies the homogeneous Bernoulli
model to capture a naive form of dependence between pairs measured by S(x). It is an analog of
the Strauss model for a point process (Strauss 1975) or the Ising model for a lattice process.
The natural parameter space of models is θ ∈ 2 ⊆ IR2 ; that is, any value of θ in the plane
corresponds to a valid probability distribution. In this illustration we will consider the case where
there are g = 7 homogeneous actors. For this model there are N = 21 pairs and |X| = 2,097,152
graphs. The degeneracy of this random graph model grows as the number of individuals increase,
but its effects can be seen even in graphs as small as 7 actors.
Figure 1 is a plot of the sufficient statistics for the model. Each circle represents a pair of
sufficient statistics (i.e., numbers of edges and 2−stars). In total there are 144 distinct pairs of
sufficient statistics. The area of each circle represents the number of isometric graphs with that
pair of sufficient statistics. For example, for the pair (10, 22) there are 79,170 graphs and for
(10, 23) there are 55,230 graphs.
The convex hull of the support C is plotted. On the boundary of C there are 22 pairs of
statistics, all of them on the bottom of the hull. These correspond to graphs with the minimum
possible number of 2−stars for the given number of edges. From the earlier results, if the observed
statistics is one of these 22, then the MLE of θ2 does not exist, and the MLE of θ1 is the log-odds
of the observed density. If the observed statistic is not one of these then the MLE can be calculated
from (4).
We are less concerned with estimation here, and more concerned with the nature of the probability mass functions defined by the 2−star model. What do the graphs generated from this model
look like? What are their sufficient statistics? Figure 2 is a plot of some characteristics of the
12

realizations of this model for different parameter values. Consider panel (a). It represents a plot of
the parameter space of θ . The Bernoulli graphs correspond to the horizontal line at zero. Values
in the bottom half-plane correspond to negatively dependent ties. Values in the top half-plane correspond to positively dependent ties. The gray-scale image is the probability of the empty graph
graph for that parameter (i.e., Pθ (X = 0)). Darker values correspond to higher probability. As
expected, parameter values in the bottom-left quadrant place increasingly high probability on the
empty graph.
Of what import is this? We rarely analyze network data when there are not ties (i.e., the graph is
empty). Thus parameter values that correspond to distributions that say the empty graph is almost
certain are not realistic. This is not to say that models should exclude completely the empty graph,
only that models that place all their mass on the empty graph are not very interesting. Graph models
in the bottom-left quadrant are examples of degenerate models for most empirical applications.
Consider panel (b). This is the equivalent plot for the probability of the complete graph. Parameter values in the top quadrants place high probability on the complete graph. These models
are degenerate for most purposes. Panels (c)-(h) consider other forms of model degeneracy that
may be unrealistic in many applications. Clearly the designation of model degeneracy depends on
the use to which the model will be put, but the models in these panels are unlikely to be realistic
for most applications.
Figure 3 is the cumulative plot for all the degeneracies in Figure 2. The models in the dark
region place almost all their probability mass on a small number of unrealistic graph configurations.
The vast majority of graphs, including almost all those likely to be of practical interest, have
negligible probability of occurring. The light area corresponds to the set of models that are nondegenerate. Thus if we are searching for models that represent realistic behavior we must consider
models in this small wedge of the parameter space. Thus even though any value of θ in IR2
corresponds to a valid probability distribution, only this small subset of models will usually be
“interesting” from a modeling viewpoint.
These figures illustrate that the effective natural parameter spaces of exponentially parametrized
random graph models are limited. The shape of the non-degenerate region of the parameter space
and especially the uneven shading of the bottom-right quadrant make direct interpretation of the
region difficult.
For the 2−star model the mean-value parametrization is
µ1 ≡ E[E(x)] =

X

E[xi j ] = N E[x12 ]

i< j

Here µ1 is the expected number of edges, and µ1 /N is the probability that two actors are tied.
Hence it is a direct and natural measure of network density on an interpretable scale. In addition it

13

is bounded between zero and N (or unity in the density form). The other parameter is
 
X
g
E[xi j xik ] = 3
E[x12 x13 ]
µ2 ≡ E[S(x)] =
3
i< j<k

Thus µ2 is the expected number of 2−stars, or µ2 /(3

g
3 )

is the probability that an actor is tied to

randomly chosen other actors. Like µ1 , it is a direct and natural measure of network dependence
on a interpretable scale. These advantages hold true for general models if the network statistics are
directly interpretable.
Panel (a) of Figure 4 is a plot of the µ−parameter space. The total shaded region (i.e., both red
and green) is the parameter space and is identical to C, the convex hull of the sufficient statistics.
The boundary of the space is marked by the sufficient statistics that form the convex hull of C.
Note that the space is exactly the interior of the hull, that is, the continuous open bounded set.
As this space is just a mapping of the θ −parameter space it must also contain the near degenerate graphs. However, they are not apparent. The red corresponds region in the plot corresponds
to parameter values that are within 1 edge unit of the boundary. For example, values close to (0, 0)
correspond to probability distributions with close to zero edges and 2−stars (i.e., empty graphs).
Models with parameters close to (21, 105) correspond to probability distributions with close to all
edges and all 2−stars (i.e., complete graphs). Models that hug the bottom of the hull have the minimum number of 2−stars for the given number of edges. Finally models close to the top diagonal
of the hull correspond to models with the maximum number of 2−stars for the given number of
edges. All of these models are near degenerate in the same sense as the previous section. However the geometry of the µ−parameter space makes the identification of near degenerate models
clearer. Different definitions of model degeneracy can be applied. The red band here represents
models that expect to have less than one edge, at most one missing edge, or to be within one 2−
star of the extreme number for the given number of edges.
Equation (7) can be used to map non-degenerate models into the θ−parameter space. Panel
(b) of Figure 4 is a plot of the non-degenerate region of the θ −parameter space mapped from
panel (a). The interior of the “stealth-bomber”-like region corresponds to the parameter values
that give non-degenerate models. Parameters outside this region fall in the border region of panel
(a) and hence degenerate models by this definition. The crenelated nature of the region is one
reason that analysis using the θ −parameterization has been difficult, since only models in this
region (or something similar in shape to it) are viable for modeling. The relative simplicity and
interpretability of the µ−parameter space to that in the θ −parameter space is an important benefit.
Of particular note is that small regions of the µ−parameter space are mapped to large, unbounded
regions of the θ −parameter space. Panel (c) is a plot of the non-degenerate region of the natural
parameter space with the location of the realizable MLEs superimposed. Most of the values for
real data will exhibit positive dependence and occur in the top-left quadrant. In particular, many
14

will occur close to the narrow peninsula at the top (the “nose” of the stealth bomber). If a search
routine does not take this geometry into account it will quickly yield issues of convergence.
Finally, panel (b) of Figure 4 can be overlayed with Figure 3. As can be seen the two regions
are very similar. Thus this parametization provides the theoretical basis of the model degeneracy
plots.
The behavior of the full conditional MCMC can be explained for the 2−star model. For this
model M(θ) = max{|θ |, θ1 + 2(g − 2)θ2 } and this corresponds to either the complete or empty
graph. Hence if θ1 >> 0 the MCMC will have poor coverage of X. For example, consider the case
where g = 7 and θ = (4.5, −18.4)). For this model µ(θ) ≈ (3, 0) and M(θ) = 4.5. An MCMC
chain will approach (3, 0) ∈ rbd(C) and stay there 98.9% of the time with 1.1% at (2, 0) ∈ rbd(C);
the sample has essentially two-states.
If θ2 >> 0 the MCMC will typically have poor coverage of X. Note that the magnitude of
the second term in M(θ ) increases linearly with the number of nodes in the graph. For example,
consider in the case where g = 7 and θ = (−3.43, 0.683). For this model µ(θ) ≈ (9, 40) and
M(θ ) = max{3.43, 3.40). The distribution places 50% of its mass on graphs with 2 or fewer
edges and 36% on graphs with at least 19 edges. It also mixes very slowly between these groups,
as is shown, in Figure 5. This plots the traces and marginal densities of the samples of edges
and 2−stars from this model and based on 100,000 iterations of the full-conditional MCMC. The
algorithm mixes very slowly between the set of nearly empty graphs and the nearly complete
graphs. Alternative MCMC algorithms, such as a Swendsen-Wang variant (Swendsen and Wang
1987) would help in this situation, but not in general (e.g., the previous example).
The 2−star model is unstable in the natural parametrization as small changes in the value of θ2
when it is positive can greatly affect the model. For example, if θ2 = 0.67 in the previous model
µ(θ) ≈ (4.4, 17.1) and the distribution places almost all its mass on the mode of empty graphs.
7. DISCUSSION
This paper addresses the question of what is a “good” model for a network and in doing so it
helps to resolve the problem of lack of convergence when estimation or simulating using MCMC.
These results also indicate that mean value and mixed parameterizations are a natural way to represent exponential parametrized random graph models. While they appear to suffer from more
indirect specification of the likelihood, this is overshadowed by their interpretability, ease of estimation, and the stability and functionality of their parameter space.
One implication of these results is that the effective parameter space of exponentially parameterized random graph models is a small, bounded subset of the theoretical parameter space. Limiting inferences to this viable region in the parameter space can be accomplished in a Bayesian
framework, via the use of parameter priors which concentrate most or all of the prior probability
15

mass on viable models. The Bayesian framework for inference promises to be very powerful for
network modeling. In addition to reducing model degeneracy, it facilitates the propagation of parameter uncertainty into the final inference, and allows the incorporation of expert prior knowledge
when it exists. While questions remain regarding the optimal selection of parameter priors, we expect that Bayesian inference for general random graph models will contribute greatly to the tools
available to network researchers in the years ahead.
In the context of spatial Markov random fields, Besag (1986) has argued that the maximum
pseudolikelihood estimator reflects the “local” (spatial) neighborhood information, as compared
to the maximum likelihood estimator which reflects the “global” neighborhood information. Our
results, and the experience of others, suggest that commonly used random graph models are more
global than local in structure, and that even those with nodal Markov dependence are global. Hence
the current approach to pseudolikelihood estimation will have poor statistical properties. This
same global nature of the existing models contributes to their model degeneracy and instability
problems. These issues are not resolved by alternative forms of estimation but represent defects in
the models themselves – at least, to the extent that they are useful for modeling realistic graphs.
Recent advances in model specification, cognizant of these issues, hold much promise (Nowicki
and Snijders 2001; Pattison and Robins 2002; Hoff et al. 2002; Schweinberger and Snijders 2003;
Snijders et al. 2004).
APPENDIX: TECHNICAL DETAILS
In this appendix we provide support for the results given in the paper. The model (1) is a finite
statistical exponential family with respect to counting measure on X. We assume that the dimension
of X is q so that the family is minimal and the parameter space is {θ : c(θ, X) < ∞} = IRq so that
it is also full. The results follow from the general theory of exponential families. Here we give a
guide to those results.
Existence and uniqueness of the MPLE and MLE
The derivation of the result in Section 3.1 follows from the equivalence of the MPLE algorithm to
a logistic regression on δ(xicj . This logistic model forms an exponential family. The result is then
derivable from Barndorff-Nielsen (1978, Section 9.3). The equation of result 1 is derivable from
the convex hull formed by δ(xicj ), x ∈ X. It can also be derived from Albert and Anderson (1984)
and Santner and Duffy (1986). Our appeal to exponential family theory provides a direct alternative
derivation to that given by those authors. The result in Section 3.2 follows from Barndorff-Nielsen
(1978, Corollary 9.6).
Likelihood-based inference based on MCMC Algorithms

16

The sample {t (y (1) ), . . . , t (y (M) )} form a statistical exponential family with respect to counting
measure. The result then follows from Barndorff-Nielsen (1978, Corollary 9.6).
What makes a useful model for a social network?
The first three statements are versions of Barndorff-Nielsen (1978, Section 9.8, (viii)). The last
follows from the definition of the Kullback-Leibler discriminant information and the third result.
