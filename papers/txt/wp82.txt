Abstract
Objective: To construct confidence and prediction intervals for HIV prevalence in countries
with generalized epidemics.
Methods: In the Bayesian melding approach, a sample of country-specific epidemic curves
describing HIV prevalence over time is derived based on time series of antenatal clinic prevalence data and general information on the parameters that describe the HIV epidemic. The
prevalence trends at antenatal clinics are calibrated based on population prevalence estimates. For countries without population based estimates, a general calibration method is
developed. Based on the sample of calibrated epidemic curves, we derive annual 95% confidence intervals for HIV prevalence in past years and 95% prediction intervals for future HIV
prevalence. The curve that best represents the data at antenatal clinics and populationbased surveys, as well as general information about the epidemic, is chosen to represent the
best estimates and predictions.
Results: We present results of the method for urban areas in Haiti and Namibia.

Introduction

In 2003, UNAIDS included information on uncertainty in its estimates and projections by
calculating and presenting plausibility bounds (C. et al. 2004). These bounds were derived
by combining the results of a bootstrap method with expert opinion regarding the range of
possible epidemic curves, and were not to be interpreted as formal statistical confidence intervals. Alkema, Raftery and Clark (2007) proposed using Bayesian melding for uncertainty
assessment in the model in the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP), the package
used by UNAIDS and country officials for prevalence estimation and prediction. Bayesian
melding provides a way of including expert opinion while still giving formal statistical confidence intervals. It is a method for assessing uncertainty about the inputs and outputs of
a deterministic model, such as the EPP model. Bayesian melding was first developed to
estimate the rate of increase of whale populations (E. et al. 1995; D. and Raftery 2000), and
was successfully applied to policy-making in that context. When applying this approach to
the EPP model, it gives the one “best” trajectory of HIV prevalence over time, as well as
the uncertainty in the estimates and projections in the form of a set of possible epidemic
curves. These curves reflect the uncertainty about the past and future and are based on the
(imperfect) information that is available about the model’s inputs and outputs.
In 2006 the UNAIDS reference group recommended the use of Bayesian melding for uncertainty assessment in EPP. The application of Bayesian melding to the EPP model is
discussed in detail in (L. et al. 2007). In this paper we summarize the approach in a less
technical way in the Methods section and discuss the recent changes based on recommendations by the UNAIDS reference group: the prior distributions on the input parameters and
the calibration of prevalence curves based on antenatal clinic prevalence to the outcomes of
population-based surveys. We give results for Haiti and Namibia and end with a discussion
of the method.

Methods

Bayesian melding for the Estimation and Projection Package
In Bayesian melding, “melding” refers to combining (melding) information about the inputs
and outputs of a deterministic model, such as the model in EPP for generalized epidemics
(UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections 2002). In the EPP
model, the population of 15 to 49 year-olds is divided into three groups, a not-at-risk group,
an at-risk group and an infected group. Three differential equations describe the changes in
those groups over time, and thus in prevalence over time. Four parameters determine the
shape of the epidemic curve: r, which is the growth rate of the epidemic, f0 , the fraction
of population initially at risk, t0 the start year of the epidemic (in which a fraction of the
1

population that is initially at risk get infected) and φ, the behavioral response. Information
about the inputs and outputs in the EPP model is given by expert knowledge about the
input parameters and upper bounds on prevalence in certain years, and prevalence data.
“Bayesian” refers to Bayesian inference, which starts by quantifying prior beliefs (expert
knowledge) about the true value of a quantity of interest. For example, in HIV estimation
using EPP, there could be a consensus that the epidemic started no sooner than 1970, and
no later than 1990. The upper and lower bounds on the start year of the epidemic serve
as boundaries on any projections that would then be developed. In Bayesian inference,
prior beliefs are represented by probability distributions; for example, the start year of the
epidemic could have a uniform distribution on the interval between the upper and lower
bounds. Likewise, priors distributions can be determined for the other three parameters in
the epidemic curve fit, as well as for the output of the EPP model, prevalence over time.
For example, there could be a consensus that prevalence in 1980 was no higher than 5%.
After quantifying prior beliefs, they are applied to generate a set of possible epidemic
curves (curves that are based on the EPP parameters and satisfy the constraints imposed on
prevalence). The beliefs, i.e, the ranges of parameters which are acceptable, are then updated
based on the observed outcomes of comparing these curves with the observed data. For HIV
prevalence estimates with the EPP model, HIV prevalence is observed at antenatal clinics,
and for some countries population surveys are available as well. Data and information on
measurement errors are used to calculate a measure of the so-called ”likelihood”: An epidemic
curve which is similar to the level and trend in observed prevalence has a high likelihood of
representing true prevalence.
Combining prior distributions with likelihood (updating prior beliefs) gives the “posterior” distribution of the quantity of interest. Melding the prior distributions on inputs
and output with the likelihood on output gives posterior distributions on inputs as well as
outputs; e.g. the posterior distribution of past and future prevalence.
The Bayesian melding approach for EPP produces a sample from the posterior distributions on inputs and outputs. All the information that is needed can be derived from this
sample. For example, the best prediction and lower and upper bounds of future prevalence
are calculated from the posterior sample of prevalence curves.

2.1

Constructing a sample of prevalence curves

We now describe how to get a sample of prevalence curves based on data from antenatal
clinics (ANC). For most countries, these data sets are the only available source of times series
of prevalence data which are needed to estimate the trend in HIV prevalence. Nationally
representative population surveys, particularly the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS),
are used to calibrate the results based on antenatal clinic data, as discussed below.
The sample from the posterior distribution of HIV prevalence curves is drawn using the
2

Sampling Importance Resample (SIR) algorithm (Rubin 1987, 1988), as follows:
1. Sample a large number of different combinations of the input parameters r, f0 , t0 and
φ from their prior distributions.
2. For each combination of the input parameters, run the EPP model to produce the
corresponding epidemic curve.
3. Each curve is compared to HIV prevalence data from antenatal clinics and assigned a
weight based on the likelihood of the curve (how well it fits the data) and the prior
assumptions on prevalence. For example, if the epidemic curve, as generated by the
various combinations of input parameters, is very different from the observed rates,
that curve will get a low or zero weight. If the curve resembles the data reasonably
well, it will get a high weight. If the curve falls outside any user established prior
limitations on prevalence (e.g., if the expert user specified prevalence in 1999 is less
than 5% and the curve being compared has a prevalence of 9%), its weight is set to
zero.
4. The epidemic curves as well as their input parameters get resampled, based on these
weights. The probability of resampling is proportional to the weight that has been
assigned to that curve.
The result is a sample from the posterior distribution of prevalence, in the form of a set
of prevalence curves. The number of sets of input parameters that are sampled in step 1
should be large enough such that they cover the input space and a reasonable number of
unique curves get selected in the last step. We found 200,000 sets of inputs to work well
for most countries. A much smaller number is needed in the resample step (5), e.g. 3,000
curves, to get a sample from the posterior based on the large set of initial curves.

2.2

Prior distributions

Prior distributions on the four input parameters to the EPP model are specified using expert
knowledge. They should be broad enough to not exclude values that are supported by the
data (i.e. that have high likelihood) unless there is strong knowledge that excluding some
values is appropriate. In the EPP 2007 computer program, default prior distributions are
given for each of the four input parameters. The prior distribution for the fraction initially
at risk, f0 , is uniform between 0 and 1, and the start year of the epidemic, t0 , is discrete
uniform on {1970, . . . , 1990}. If the default limits on these distributions are too constraining,
users can change them to ones that are appropriate for their own country’s situation. For
example, in many Asian countries, a more reasonable range of start years might be 1980 to
2000.

Values of the rate of increase, r, as used in the country projections by UNAIDS in 2005,

Figure 1(b) shows the estimates of behavioral response φ from 2005 (excluding a few very
large values, for easier visualization). The default prior distribution chosen for the behavioral
response φ is drawn in the same figure and is given by:
φ ∼ Logistic(100, 50),

(1)

such that φ ranges roughly between -50 and 250, centered around 100. This is broad enough
to cover the range of the previous estimates, and also reflects the expectation that the
behavioral response parameter is unlikely to be highly negative.
EPP also allows the user to specify upper or lower bounds on prevalence in certain years,
for example, restricting prevalence in 1980 to be smaller than 1% to exclude unrealistic
epidemic curves that peak around that year at high prevalence levels.

2.3

Calibrating ANC prevalence curves

Because of the difference between antenatal clinic prevalence and population prevalence as
measured by surveys like the DHS as discussed in (E. 2008) and (K. 2008), calibration of
the prevalence curves based on, and thus representing, antenatal clinic prevalence is needed.
This section discusses the calibration of HIV prevalence for countries in which one or more
population surveys have been conducted, and the calibration method for countries without
population surveys, based on observed differences between ANC and population prevalence
in other countries.
4

Countries with population survey(s)
For countries with one DHS estimate, a calibration constant is calculated such that median
posterior prevalence in the year of the survey as given by the Bayesian melding procedure
based on ANC data will be rescaled at the DHS estimate. The calibration constant is
calculated on the probit scale, such that the influence of the calibration constant decreases
for lower prevalence. We define probit transformed observed HIV prevalence as measured in
the DHS in year t as:
Wdhs,t = Φ−1 (xdhs,t ),

(2)

where Φ(·) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and
xdhs,t

Ydhs,t + 12
=
.
Ndhs,t + 1

(3)

In equation (3), Ydhs,t is the number of HIV-positives in the DHS sample in year t and Ndhs,t
is the sample size of the DHS survey. The constants 1/2 and 1 in Eq. 3 are included to
avoid problems with zeros. We denote the probit transformed curves representing antenatal
ˆ anc,t . The
clinic prevalence by Wanc and the transformed median estimate in year t by W
calibration constant for the DHS survey in year t is denoted by ct and given by:
ˆ anc,t .
ct = Wdhs,t − W

(4)

For countries with one survey, the final calibration constant is c = ct , and is added to the
trajectories of antenatal clinic prevalence to get the calibrated population prevalence:
Wpop = Wanc + c,

(5)

ρ = Φ(Wpop ),

(6)

where Wpop is a sampled calibrated epidemic curve on the probit scale, and ρ is a sampled
trajectory of HIV prevalence representative for the overall population. Note that calibration
is done separately for urban and rural areas. For countries with more than one survey,
the calibration constant c is given by the mean of each of the survey-specific calibration
constants.
In order to take into account the uncertainty in the DHS estimate and to incorporate
possible trends as given by more than one DHS estimate, the calibrated curves need to be
resampled, with weights proportional to the DHS likelihood, to incorporate the likelihood
of the DHS estimates in the posterior sample of prevalence curves. As for the antenatal
clinic data in (L. et al. 2007), we derive the likelihood for DHS data by assuming that the
sampling error is normally distributed on the probit scale:
Wdhs,t |Wpop,t ∼ N (Wpop,t , V ar(Wdhs,t )).
5

(7)

The variance of the DHS estimate is based on the binomial variance in the sample, multiplied
by the design effect to take into account the cluster sampling procedure. The design effect
for a cluster design is the ratio of the variance for that design to the variance calculated
from a simple random sample of the same size. In EPP 2007 the default value for the design
effect is 2, according to UNAIDS guidelines for measuring prevalence in population based
surveys (UNAIDS/WHO 2005). With design effect δ, the variance of the DHS estimate on
the probit scale is approximately equal to:
V ar(Wdhs,t ) = δπρdhs,t (1 − ρdhs,t )e(Φ

−1 (ρ

2
dhs,t )

) /N

dhs,t ,

(8)

where ρdhs,t is the true DHS prevalence rate. Estimating ρdhs,t by xdhs,t gives an estimate of
the variance on the probit scale. The likelihood of the DHS data given a calibrated epidemic
curve can now be determined using Eq. 7. An example of the calibration is given in the
Results section for Haiti.
2.3.1

Countries without a DHS survey

EPP allows ANC prevalence estimates for countries without DHS estimates to be adjusted
based on the biases revealed by DHS surveys in other countries. We assume that there is
an overall bias which gives the difference between ANC and DHS. This bias is unknown,
because of the measurement errors in both the ANC and the DHS estimates. The mean
bias and its standard error are estimated from the data from countries with DHS surveys,
separately for urban and rural areas. These estimates are used to adjust ANC prevalence in
countries without population prevalence estimates.
Observed differences between ANC prevalence and DHS estimates are used to calculate
calibration constants on the probit scale. The distribution of the calibration constant is based
on the observed ANC bias in 17 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Burkina Faso, Burundi,
Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia)1 . The adjustment for rural areas is bigger
than for urban areas, so we derive the distribution of the calibration constant for those two
sub-populations separately. On the probit scale the mean calibration constant (difference
between ANC and DHS prevalence) for urban areas is 0.11 with standard error 0.04, for
rural areas 0.17 with standard error 0.05.
To construct calibrated prevalence curves that are representative for the overall population in urban areas, a calibration constant curban is sampled and added to Wanc :
curban ∼ N (0.11, .042 ),

(9)

Wpop = Wanc + curban ,

(10)

ρ = Φ(Wpop ),

(11)

1

We excluded Senegal because there HIV seems to be more concentrated in high risk groups, and so the
survey might not be representative of overall national prevalence.

6

where Wanc is a sampled trajectory of ANC prevalence on the probit scale, Wpop is the
corresponding calibrated epidemic curve on the probit scale, and ρ is the resulting sampled
trajectory of HIV prevalence for the overall population, in this case the population living in
urban areas. The adjustment for rural epidemics is done similarly, with:
crural ∼ N (0.17, .052 ).

(12)

Table 1 summarizes the effect of the calibration when ANC prevalence is 5, 10, 15 and
20%. For example, if ANC prevalence is 15% in urban areas, urban population prevalence is
estimated as 12.6% with 95% confidence interval [11.2%, 14.1%]. The downward adjustment
is larger for rural prevalence: for example, if ANC prevalence is 15%, the adjusted prevalence
in rural areas is 11.3%, with 95% confidence interval [9.6%, 13.3%].

Figure 2 shows the ratio of adjusted (calibrated) prevalence over ANC prevalence for ANC
prevalence ranging from 0 to 30%. The observed ratios of DHS surveys over ANC prevalence
are shown in the same figure. The results of this calibration method are illustrated for urban
areas in Namibia in the Results section.

Best estimate, confidence and prediction intervals

Based on the (calibrated) sample of curves from the posterior distribution of HIV prevalence
curves, a 95% confidence or prediction interval for prevalence in a given year is given by
the lower 2.5th and the upper 97.5th percentiles of the prevalences for that year within the
sample. The “best” prediction is the trajectory that is most likely to represent prevalence
over time, given prior distributions and data. This maximum a posteriori (MAP) trajectory
is the one with the highest posterior density, proportional to the product of the prior distributions on the inputs of the curve, the prior distributions on outputs and the likelihood of
the data. For countries without a DHS estimate, the best calibrated prediction is given by
the MAP curve as derived for ANC data, with the mean calibration constant added to it.
For countries with one or more DHS estimates, the maximum a posteriori curve is given by
the calibrated curve with the maximum product of input priors, ANC likelihood and DHS
likelihood.
Epidemics are fit separately for urban and rural areas. For deriving nationally representative estimates and projections, sub-epidemics are combined by sampling trajectories from
each sub-epidemic, weighting each trajectory by population size in each year and adding
them up.

RESULTS

In this section we will present the results of the Bayesian melding procedure for urban areas in
Haiti and Namibia. Note that the estimates and predictions as derived here are illustrative
and are not the official estimates, as our analysis might not include all the information
available.

3.1

Haiti

Adult HIV prevalence in the Caribbean is estimated at 1.0% [0.9%, 1.2%] in 2007, (UNAIDS 2007). Prevalence in this region is highest in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
In Figure 3(a), HIV prevalence data for urban areas in Haiti is given by the colored lines
for 17 antenatal clinics (data taken from (M. and Eustache (2007)). Sample sizes for each
clinic range from 14 to 393 women, and observed prevalence in 2006-2007 ranges from 0% to
12.2%. The light grey curves in the plot are a sample from the posterior distribution of the
ANC prevalence curves, based on the default priors on the input parameters, and restricting
prevalence in 1980 to be smaller than 1%. The red curve gives the best estimates and (MAP
curve) and the dashed lines show the year-specific 95% confidence and prediction intervals.
Based on antenatal clinic data, the posterior median of prevalence is 5.3% for 2007, with
95% confidence interval [4.3%, 6.7%].

9

In 2005-2006, DHS carried out a population-based survey in Haiti. For urban areas,
HIV prevalence was estimated to be 2.3% (with sample size 4382, design effect set to 2).In
Figure 3(a) and (b) the DHS estimate is shown by the red diamond. In Figure 3(b), this
estimate is used to calibrate the trajectories as given by the ANC data. In this plot, each
of the light grey curves represents calibrated prevalence over time, with 95% confidence
intervals (dashed lines) and best estimate as given by the MAP curve (red). The calibration
based on the DHS estimate gives a significant reduction in estimated prevalence level and
uncertainty. Based on antenatal clinic data and the DHS estimate, the posterior median of
prevalence is 2.3% for 2007, with 95% confidence interval [1.9%, 2.8%].

Namibia

Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most affected region in the global AIDS epidemic. The scale
and trends of the epidemics in the region vary considerably, with southern Africa most seriously affected (UNAIDS 2007). Namibia is one of the countries in Southern Africa with high
HIV prevalence levels. Figure 4 shows data from three urban antenatal clinics in Katurtura,
Walvisbay and Windhoek (data taken from the Epidemiological Fact Sheets on HIV/AIDS
and Sexually Transmitted Infections 2006 at
http://www.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/EFS2006/index.asp and (of Health
and Namibia 2007)). In Katurtura (in pink) prevalence is given for 2004 and 2006, 15.9%
and 21.1% respectively. In Walvisbay (turquoise) data is available from 1998 until 2006,
with prevalence decreasing from 29% in 1998 to 22.1% in 2006. For the clinic in Windhoek
(green), HIV prevalence estimates are available from 1994 until 2006. Note that prevalence
in 2002 was estimated at 26.7%, while at the next measurement in 2006, it was 9.1%. Based
on the antenatal clinic data, median prevalence in 2007 is estimated at 16.2%, with 95%
confidence interval [12.2%, 21.4%].
Namibia has no DHS survey to calibrate the ANC prevalence curves. We use the general
calibration method as described in the previous section. The results are shown in Figure 4(b).
After calibrating the ANC curves, median prevalence in 2007 is estimated at 13.5%, with
95% confidence interval [10.0%, 18.0%]. Note the uncertainty in past estimates in HIV
prevalence, the lengths of the confidence intervals are approximately 10% from 1998 until
2006.

In this article we have described the Bayesian melding approach to assessing uncertainty in
HIV prevalence estimates as given by the model in the Estimation and Projection Package.
Using the Bayesian melding procedure, prevalence over time is described by a sample of epidemic trajectories, which are chosen based on all available information on input parameters
of the model and prevalence data. Uncertainty about past and future prevalence is given by
year-specific 95% confidence and prediction intervals.
The trend in prevalence over time is derived from what has been observed at antenatal
clinics, and calibrated to represent prevalence in the overall population based on populationbased surveys. In the current calibration of HIV prevalence curves to population-based
estimates, the latter estimates are taken to be unbiased estimates of population prevalence.
The general calibration method for countries without population-based estimates allows for
adjusting upwards biases in antenatal clinic data as compared to population estimates. This
calibration method gives the overall adjustment, based on what has been observed in several
countries. With more population-based surveys becoming available, fewer countries will need
to use the general calibration method, and country-specific calibrations can be carried out
to get more accurate estimates and predictions of HIV prevalence.
