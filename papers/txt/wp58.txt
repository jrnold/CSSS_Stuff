Abstract
This paper develops a joint model of the marriage and partner choice decisions. Each
individual chooses his (or her) own optimal feasible partner type, based on preference and
endowments, and the marriage market. He marries when utility when married to the optimal
feasible partner exceeds utility when single. This generates a selection model in which the
partner choice equation (spouse characteristics as a function of own characteristics and market
variables) is estimated only for married individuals. In the selection equation, the likelihood of
marriage depends on the same set of regressors plus variables describing the subjects’ parents’
religion and religiosity and the sex composition of his offspring.

I estimate the model for both men and women separately, using data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The results indicate that there is substantial positive
selection into marriage, particularly for men. Selection corrected coefficients of dummy
variables indicating White and high school completion are substantially higher than the
corresponding OLS coefficients.

I. Introduction

The last several decades have been characterized by a “retreat from marriage”. Increases
in both the age at first marriage and the likelihood of divorce have combined to lower the
likelihood of marriage at virtually all ages. The retreat, however, has not been evenly
distributed across the population. For instance, the decline in marriage has been less pronounced
for the more educated (Rose, 2005).
Marriage matching patterns have changed as well. Consistent with Becker’s (1981)
theory of marriage, as women have become more “like men” in terms of their human capital and
labor market characteristics, there is less scope for specialization and exchange.1 This explains
the increase in positive assortative mating and the decline in hypergamy (i.e., in women
“marrying up”)2 over the last several decades.
There are many empirical papers in economics and the social sciences more broadly,
which explain the outcome “marital status”. There are a few papers which aim to explain the
choice of spouse, or partner.3 Typically, these “partner choice” equations are estimated under
OLS – modeled as some attribute of the spouse as a function of an individual’s own
characteristics, and market variables.
Clearly, an individual’s decision to marry relates to her options in the marriage market.
Also, partner characteristics are observed only for individuals with partners. When
unobservables in the marriage and partner choice equations are correlated, coefficients from the
OLS partner choice equation will be subject to selection bias. However, as Pollak (2000) points
1

Papers suggesting a decline in specialization exchange include Lundberg and Rose (1999) and
Gray (1997). Blau (1998) reports that women in 1988 spent significantly less, and men spent
somewhat more, time on housework than in 1978. Oppenheimer (1997) and others note that the
declines to specialization is predominately a phenomenon of the less-educated, as the labor
market returns for unskilled men decline.

out, there has been little attention to the simultaneity of the marriage and partner choice
decisions.4
In this paper I develop a selection model of the marriage and partner choice outcomes.
Given her own attributes and marriage market conditions, an individual’s optimal partner is
chosen by trading off partner quality for a fraction of marital output. She chooses to marry by
comparing her consumption when married to this optimal partner with her consumption when
single. The theoretical framework generates a selection model in which her parents’ religion and
religiosity when she was growing up, and the sex composition of her children, enter into the
marriage, but not the partner choice equations.
I estimate the model with data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). While
both men and women positively select into marriage on the basis of unobservables, the selection
effect is greater for men than for women. OLS estimates of the effect of race on partner quality
exhibit a particularly large downward selection bias. Some own education coefficients are
biased downward as well.
Section II describes the theoretical model of marriage and partner choice which underlies
the econometric analysis. Section III describes the econometric model and discusses econometric
issues. Section IV describes the data, and Section V presents the results. Section VI concludes.

II. Economic Model of Marriage and Partner Choice
This is a partial equilibrium model of the marriage market, which is described from the
perspective of a woman. The empirical model will be estimated for both women and men.

One paper that does look at selection issues in equations estimated for samples of married
couples include Foster (2002) who estimate the effect of parents’ characteristics on desired
education for children in rural Bangladesh. Behrman Rosenzweig and Taubman (1994) address
the issue indirectly, as differencing on a sample of twins addresses selection with respect to twinspecific unobservables. Clark and Etile (2005) model whether a spouse smokes, instrumenting
for marriage with local unemployment rates by sex and year.

Individuals maximize utility, which depends on consumption (C) and marital status (M).

U = U (C , h( X , Z , φ ) ⋅ M )

(1)

C is a continuous variable, and M is a dummy variable which equals 1 if she is married and 0 if
she is not. The function h(.) reflects her preferences for marriage, and depends on observables,

X and Z , and unobservables, φ .
Each woman brings three types of attributes to the marriage market. First, there is a
vector X of characteristics, such as education, that are observable to both the market and to the
researcher. There are also two types of unobservables - characteristics that are observable to the
market, but not to the researcher. μ L represents intelligence and the other standard
unobservables in earnings equation that favorably impact labor market outcomes. μ H represents
characteristics such as beauty and domestic skills that are more closely associated with home
productivity. As Becker (1973) points out, unobservable attributes such as intelligence and
appearance (as well as observables such as education) potentially impact both labor market and
home productivity. The presumption is that μ L has a stronger effect on the former, and μ H has
a stronger effect on the latter.
This problem is separable and is solved in two stages. The first step is to solve for a
woman’s optimal partner, given her observables, her unobservables, and the marriage market.
The second step is to determine whether or not she will marry by comparing her utility when
married to her optimal partner and her utility when single.
The market poses a tradeoff between share of marital output, α ∈ ( 0,1) , and husband
quality, Q. Individuals face a range of (Q, α ) pairs, and the fraction of output, α , is negotiated
prior to marriage. The choice is summarized by the expression:

α = α (Q; X , μ L , μ H , π )

(2)

4

where π represents market conditions favorable to women and the tradeoff between quality and
division of output is reflected by the assumption α Q < 0 .

α is increasing in X, π , and the

μ ’s.5
A married woman’s consumption is described by the expression:
CM = α (Q; X , μ L , μ H ) ⋅ g (Q; X , μ L , μ H )

(3)

where g (Q; X , μ L , μ H ) is marital output, which depends on husband quality and wife’s
characteristics.
Given her abilities and market conditions, the maximum consumption a woman can
obtain in marriage is obtained from the solution of the problem:
max CMar = max α (Q; X , μ M , μ H , π ) g (Q; X , μ M , μ H )
Q

Q

(4)

The solution of this problem is:
Q* = Q *( X , μ M , μ H , π )

(5)

A single woman’s consumption depends on her observables, X, and the two unobservable
components:
CS = f ( X , μ L , μ H )

(6)

She will marry if her utility from marrying her optimal husband outweighs her utility
from being single6; i.e., if:

M = U (CM (Q*), h( Z , X , φ ) ⋅1) − U (CS , 0) > 0

(7)

or, in reduced form,
M = M ( X , Z , π , μ L , μ H , φ ) > 0

5

(8)

Several economists, most notably Duncan Thomas (1990, 1994) argue that a spouse’s
education reflects his or her bargaining power within the household.
6
I refer to the continuous latent variable associated with the outcome marriage as M rather than
the conventional M*, to distinguish it from the “*” referring to the optimal choice, as Q* in (5).

III. Econometric Model

The econometric model of marriage and partner choice is obtained by linearizing
equations (5) and (8):
Q* = X β Q + πγ Q + ε Q

(9a)

M = X β M + πγ M + Z δ M + ε M

(9b)

X , π , and Z are vectors of observables, and β k , γ k and δ k ( k ∈ {Q, M } ) are the respective
vectors of coefficients. M > 0 ⇔ M = 1 and indicates that a woman is married. The error terms
in (9a) and (9b) can be expressed in terms of the unobservables μ L , μ H and φ , and constants a,

b, c, d and e:

ε Q = a μ L + bμ H

(10a)

ε M = cμ L + d μ H + eφ

(10b)

The selection model is estimated under maximum likelihood, assuming that ε M and ε Q
are distributed bivariate normal. As Heckman (1977) points out, estimating (9a) under OLS
yields biased estimates. When ε M and ε Q are distributed bivariate normal:

E[Q | M = 1] = β Q X Q + πγ Q + E[ε Q | M = 1]
= βQ X Q + πγ Q + cov(ε Q , ε M )λ ( X β M + πγ M + Z δ M )

(11)

where λ ( X β M + πγ M + Z δ M ) is the inverse mills ratio.
Because Z is included in (9b) but not (9a), the model is identified (in addition to the
identification through nonlinearity). The strength of the identification assumption is gauged
from a test of the joint significance of the variables included in Z .
The covariance between the error terms can be expressed as:
cov(ε Q , ε M ) = cov ( a μ L + bμ H , cμ L + d μ H + eφ )

= acσ μ2L + (ad + bc)σ μ L , μ H + bdσ μ2H + aeσ μ L ,φ + beσ μ H ,φ

6

(12)

When (12) is positive we have positive selection: On net, the unobservables associated with
attaining a high quality spouse are positively correlated with the unobservables affecting the
propensity to marry. In this case, married women have more favorable unobservables than
single women. However, if, say, c is sufficiently negatively, or if the two μ ’s are sufficiently
negative correlated, then we have negative selection. Then, married women have less favorable
unobservables than single women.
A test for the presence of selection is a test of whether:

ρ (ε Q , ε M ) ≡ cov(ε Q , ε M ) /(σ ε σ ε ) ≠ 0
Q

M

(13)

While we cannot estimate the parameters, a, b, c, d and e individually, we can conjecture about
the sign and relative magnitude of (12) (and therefore (13)) in various cases. For instance, by
assumption, μ L and μ H increase value in the marriage market and φ measures preferences for
marriage. This implies that a, b and e > 0, respectively.
For men, observables associated with labor market success are also positively associated
with marriage (Korenman and Neumark, 1991). For women, the relationship between (potential)
career success and marriage is less clear (Rose, 2005), but is certainly less positive for women
than men. If unobservables μ L have the same relationship with marriage that observables such
as education and other human capital variables, cMen > cWomen and cMen > 0 . While it is hard to
say if ability in home production is associated with greater likelihood of marriage for men, it is
likely that it is for women; i.e., that dWomen > 0 , and that the effect is larger for women than for
men; i.e., dWomen > d Men .
Unless the individual covariance terms in (12) are strongly negative, or d is sufficiently
negative, which seem unlikely, (12) will be positive for men. Moreover, the elements of the first
term will tend to be substantially larger for men than for women: labor market success is far
more likely to be associated with favorable labor market outcomes, and the unexplained variance
7

in earnings is larger for men than for women. Therefore, we would expect (13) to be larger for
men than for women.
To some extent, the omitted variables in the two equations can be proxied by parents’
education. On one hand, there could be explicit matching on parents’ characteristics, as
discussed in Fernandez (2004). Alternatively, parents’ education may proxy for some
unmeasurable individual characteristics (Lam and Schoeni, 1993).

IV. Data

The analysis uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID is a
panel data set which began in 1968 as a sample of 5000 households in the 48 contiguous states of
the United States. The individuals in these households, and splitoff households, were resurveyed
annually until 1997, at which point they were surveyed every other year.
The dependent variable, spouse quality (Q) is measured as education. Regressors include
a woman’s own characteristics ( X ) and marriage market characteristics ( π ). Own
characteristics include her education (Education), age (Age) and race (White). Education is
entered in some specifications as a pair of dummy variables corresponding to high school and
college completion (Own_High, Own_Coll).

Region of residence

(South/Northeast/Northcentral; omitted category is West) represents the marriage market
characteristics, π . Own and partner’s education are measured as years of education. Some
analyses also include measure of parents’ education. As parents’ education is reported as a
categorical variable in the PSID, the measures used indicate whether each parent graduated high
school (Mom_High, Dad_High) and college (Mom_Coll and Dad_Coll).
There are various options for instruments to be included in Z . Subset Z1 includes
measures of the religion and religiosity of the subject’s father, or the head of the household when
she was growing up. Subset Z 2 includes measures of the sex of her children.
8

There is substantial precedent for using religion and religiosity as instruments in models
of the effect of family status on some outcome (e.g., Lundberg and Plotnick,1985; Plotnick;
1990, 1992). Parental, rather than own religiosity is used here in order to capture the effect of
external social norms in shaping individual’s marriage decisions. Using variables based on
parental responses when the subject herself was a child also diminishes concerns about
correlation of the element of Z1 with ε Q . This is an alternative to Gruber’s (2005) novel
strategy for dealing with endogeneity when modeling the effects of religiosity on marriage and
divorce. He uses religious market density as an exogenous determinant of individual religiosity,
and finds that religiosity is associated with higher marriage, and lower divorce rates.
Religiosity is characterized in terms of number of times an individual attends religious
services. Questions were asked of heads in 1968, 1969, and 1971-73. Because the religiosity
questions and allowable responses varied over the period, it was not possible to develop a
completely uniform index over the years. I collapse the responses into four categories: None,

Some (less than once per week), More, (about once per week), and Lot (more than once per
week).
Heads and wives were asked about their religious preferences in the years 1970-97, 1999
and 2001. As with religiosity, the religion questions and the permissible responses changed over
the period. The four religion categories I use are Protestant_1, Protestant_2, Catholic and Other.

Protestant_1 includes Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, or “mainline
protestants” (Lehrer 2000 and others).
Appendix Tables A-1 and A-2 map the original PSID responses into the religiosity and
religion categories.
The motivation for using child sex in Z 2 is the set of findings reported in the literature
that child sex affects the likelihood of marriage. Couples with sons are less likely to divorce,
and less apt to marry in the first place, if they have sons rather than daughters (Morgan et al,
9

1988; Lundberg and Rose, 2003; Dahl and Moretti, 2004). Lundberg and Rose (2002) find that
couples with sons work more than couples with daughters. This result, combined with a number
of other papers reporting that men with sons devote more time to family activities, implies that
men devote more leisure, their private good, to the family when they have sons. Also, Lundberg
and Rose (2004) find that couples with sons spend more money on “personal care services”,
which are typically women’s goods. Both the leisure and the “personal care services” results
reflect greater distribution from fathers to mothers due to the birth of a son. As Lundberg and
Rose (2004) point out, this is consistent with the model in which fathers receive greater utility
from marriage if they have a son relative to a daughter. To the extent that this is independent of
the unobserved endowments, Z 2 is not correlated with ε Q .7
The measure of the sex composition used is First_Boy_Minus_First_Girl. This is the
difference between the dummy variable indicating whether the first child born is a boy and the
dummy variable indicating whether the first child born is a girl. Differences were used to
minimize concern that the sex composition measure was reflecting unobservables associated
with fertility (Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 2000).
I begin by using the full PSID data set. This has three subsamples: the Survey Research
Center (SRC) subsample which includes the original 3000 households selected to be a
representative of the population of the 48 states, the Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO)
subsample which contains an additional 2000 households, and the New Immigrant (NI)
subsample which was added later.
I use data on individuals between age 25 and 35, inclusive, from 1983 forward. While it
would be desirable to look at a longer period and wider age range, there was not sufficient
coverage of the religion and religiosity variables for individuals who were marriageable age

7

For similar reasons Bedard and Deschenes (2005) use child sex to instrument for women’s
marital status in a study of the effect of divorce on women’s economic status.
10

outside this window. “Nonsample individuals” – those who married or moved into PSID
households or splitoff households – were excluded from the sample. This yielded in a raw
sample of 24480 observations on women and 21681 observations on men; which fell to 20008
and 18101, respectively after deleting observations with missing values.8 Means and standard
deviations of key variables are reported in Table 1. 9

V. Results

I report three sets of results for both men and women. First, Table 2 (5) for women (men)
reports OLS results. The subsequent two tables report the results for selection models. Table 3
(6) is “Selection Model I” - the baseline specification with no interactions. Table 4 (7) is
“Selection Model II” - an interacted specification which has stronger identification. I gauge the
strength of the identification of the selection model by the p-values associated with the
hypothesis test that the coefficients in vector δ M are jointly significant. 10 In all cases, standard
errors were corrected for the fact that there are repeated observations per individual.

8

For women (men), 1109 (1047) observations were deleted because of missing region, 20 (30)
for missing race, 810 (730) for missing education, 2404 (2064) for missing religiosity and 972
(569) for missing religion. There is a subsample that is somewhat smaller for models which
include parents’ education (See footnote 11).
9
Because I use the SRC, SEO and NI subsamples, the sample is not representative of the
population. For instance, whites will tend to be undercounted. For the purpose of comparison, I
repeated most of the analysis using only the SRC sample. This is more apt to be representative
of the US population. The results are reported in the Appendix B. While the values of the
parameters differ, the qualitative findings are consistent with those reported in the body of the
paper.
10
A series of alternative specifications were carried out. These included models in which the
religion and religiosity variables were interacted with each other, with child sex, and in which
these combinations were interacted with white. Alternative specifications of the sex
composition of the children were considered. These were the difference between the number of
sons and daughters she has had by that year (Boys_Minus_Girls), and the difference between the
dummy variable indicating whether or not she had at least one boy minus a dummy variable
indicating whether or not she has had at least one girl by that year (If_Boy_Minus_If_Girl). In
general, in terms of the p-values, Model II was one of the strongest models. Results are available
from the author on request.

OLS and Selection Models - Women

The results for women are reported in Tables 2-4. Table 2 reports the baseline OLS
results. The simplest specification, reported in column 1, includes own Education, White, and
dummy variables for Region, Year and Age. Every year of education a woman gets increases her
expected husband’s education by somewhat more than a half (0.562, t=21.78) of a year. Race is
significant as well: being white increases husband’s education by somewhat less than half
(0.534, 5=4.21) of a year.
Parents’ education variables are introduced into the model in Column 211 . Mother’s
education has no significant effect, although a woman’s father’s education increases her spouse’s
education substantially. If her father graduated high school, her husband’s education is about a
third of a year (0.354, t=2.73) higher. If her father graduated college as well, her husband’s
education is nearly a half a year (0.452, t=2.58) higher on top of that. This echoes Lam and
Schoeni’s (1993) finding, using data from Brazil, that a woman’s father’s education is positively
related to her husband’s earnings. The coefficients on Education and White fall somewhat when
parents’ education is introduced, suggesting that these variables reflect some of the unobserved
heterogeneity that was picked up by Education and White in the simpler specification.
Columns 3 and 4 repeat the analyses in columns 1 and 2, respectively, the only exception
being that education is entered non-linearly: as a pair of dummy variables for high school
(Own_High) and college (Own_Coll). The results indicate that relationship is non-linear: the
college education coefficients are nearly twice as large as the high school coefficients. As with

11

The sample size is smaller when parents’ education is included. I estimated the models in
columns 1 and 3 using the sample from columns 2 and 4, respectively, in order to gauge whether
differences were attributable to the difference in the sample or the difference in the specification.
The results (which are available on request from the author) indicate that the differences are due
to the difference in the specification. The same conclusion was drawn when the exercise was
performed for Tables 3-7.
12

the linear education specification, the effect of own education is attenuated when parents’
education is included.
Estimates of the selection models are reported in Table 3 and 4. The first stage equation
from Model I includes all elements of Z1 - the religion and religiosity variables. Z 2 , child
gender, is represented by Boy_First_Minus_Girl_First. While some coefficients (eg,

Boy_First_Minus_Girl_First, More) are borderline significant, the p-values associated with the
hypothesis test that the excluded instruments are jointly significant (p>.2) indicates that the
identification in this model is not strong.
Identification for Selection Model II (Table 4) appears substantially stronger. The pvalues for the hypothesis test that the δ M ’s are jointly significant are all less than 0.0001. There
is significant positive selection, with ρ (ε Q , ε M ) ranging from 0.44 to 0.62, and covariances
cov(ε Q , ε M ) ranging from 0.83 to 1.31.
Having a first son relative to a daughter leads to a lower likelihood of marriage (z=1.62 to
z=1.94 in columns 1 and 4, respectively) This is initially surprising given that Dahl and Moretti
(2004) and Lundberg and Rose (2003), report that having a son is associated with a lower
likelihood of divorce and higher likelihood of marriage subsequent to non-marital birth.
However, as Morgan and Pollard (2002) and Lundberg and Rose (2003) report, the son-marriage
bias appears to be declining over time – these results suggest that it is reversing.
There are three notable findings from the second stage equations. First, despite the fact
that women are positively selected into marriage, the selection corrected Education and

Own_Coll coefficients are similar to the respective OLS coefficients. Second, the selection
coefficient on Own_High coefficient is somewhat greater than the OLS coefficient. Third, the
selection correct coefficient on White is substantially greater than the OLS coefficient. For

13

instance, in terms of the column 2 results, the selection corrected estimate .840 (z=3.65) is more
than double the OLS estimate of .393 (t=3.00).

OLS and Selection Models - Men

The format of Tables 5-7 is identical to that of Tables 2-4. There are some notable
differences in the results for women and men. The education coefficients are similar for women
and for men. However, the OLS coefficients reported in Table 5 indicate that a man’s race being

White either has no effect or lowers the education of a man’s optimal feasible partner. Second,
for men, mother’s as well as father’s education helps a man obtain a more educated spouse.
The two selection models provide reasonably strong identification; p-values range from
.012 to .025 for Model I (Table 6) and .020 to .104 for Model II (Table 7). There is significant
positive selection for men: ρ (ε Q , ε M ) ranges from 0.71 to 0.78, and cov(ε Q , ε M ) ranges from
1.34 to 1.45.
The results suggest marked selection bias on the OLS results in several respects. The
OLS Education coefficient from Column 2 in Table 5 was 0.474; the comparable selection
corrected estimates were both 0.512 – indicating that the OLS estimate was biased downward by
.038 or 7.4 percent. More striking is the difference in the coefficient on White. While the OLS
coefficients were small and insignificant or even negative, Selection Model I, for instance, yields
estimates ranging from .357 (z=2.47) to .570 (z=3.95).

Discussion

For the most part, own education, parents’ education, and White, are associated with
marrying a high quality partner: Coefficients on own education, when entered linearly and as a
pair of dummy variables are positive in all specifications for both men and women. Parents’
education coefficients are either positive or not significant. The effect of being white is positive
14

in all specifications except the OLS specification for men, where it is either insignificant or
negative.
In terms of the effects of these variables on the likelihood of marriage, education overall
increases the likelihood of marriage, as does having completed twelve years of education.
However, given that a man, or a woman, has a high school degree, having a college degree does
not increase the likelihood of marriage in this sample. Conditional on own education, parents’
education has a negative effect on the likelihood of marriage, if any.
The conjecture, as discussed in Section II, is that there would be positive selection for
both men and women. Also, as the characteristics associated with success in the marriage
market are more closely associated with human capital unobservables for men than for women,
the selection effect, cov(ε Q , ε M ) , would be more positive for men. This is supported in the
results, in which the correlations between the error terms range from 1.37 to 1.45 for men and
from 0.83 to 1.31 for women in Selection Model II.
How do we interpret the differences between the OLS and Selection corrected estimates?
In the very simplest case, when a variable increases the likelihood of marriage, and
cov(ε Q , ε M ) > 0, we would then expect to find the OLS coefficient to be smaller than the
corrected coefficient. For instance, suppose education increases the likelihood of marriage
(which it does), and unobservables associated with marriage are positively correlated with
unobservables associated with spouse quality (which they are). The OLS education coefficient
reflects not only the effect of education but the fact that those who respond to the incentive at the
margin have less favorable unobservables than those who were married anyway. The selection
model explicitly separates the two effects.
The differences between the OLS and selection corrected education coefficients are
modest, but tend to be greater for men than for women. For men, the (column 1) selection
corrected estimate of the effect of Education is 7.3 percent greater than the OLS estimate. For
15

women, the difference is 3.3 percent. Breaking the education variables into dummy variables for
high school and college reveals that the differences vary by level of education. The (column 3)
coefficients on Own_Coll are very similar in the OLS and corrected specifications for both men
and women. However, the Own_High coefficient is 35.4 greater than the OLS estimate for men,
and 23.2 percent greater than the OLS coefficient for women.
The most dramatic differences are in terms of the effect of race. OLS estimates of the
coefficients on White are substantially lower than selection corrected effects. For instance, for
men, the OLS result in column (4) of Table 5 is -0.213 (t=1.89), which suggests that white men
marry lower quality women than non-white men; i.e., that White, which is generally viewed as a
favorable attribute in labor markets, is a negative attribute in the marriage markets. However,
the comparable selection corrected effect from Table 6 is 0.357 (z=2.47), and the coefficient on

White in the marriage equation is positive and significant. Intuitively, if we could take a nonwhite man at the margin of marriage and make him white he would marry, but he would bring
with him lower unobservables ( ε Q ), on average, than the men who were already married.
The comparisons for women are dramatic as well: the column (4) OLS estimate of the

White coefficient from Table 2 is 0.340 (t=2.47). Unlike the estimate for men, this is positive.
However, it is still far smaller than the corrected estimate: approximately one-third of the Table 4
corrected coefficient of 0.969 (z=4.24). Inferences made from the OLS coefficients would be
terribly off. It is notable that White has a particularly strong effect on the likelihood of marriage
in the first stage equations (this is obscured because of the interactions in Selection Model II). In
general, researchers should interpret with caution estimated OLS partner choice coefficients on
variables that also have a strong effect on the likelihood of marriage.

Conclusion

In this paper I estimate uncorrected, and selection corrected, models of partner choice for
men and women using data from the PSID. I find that both men and women select positively
into marriage. There is substantial downward bias in the OLS race coefficient, some education
coefficients are biased as well.
As expected, men are more positively selected into marriage than women. This is
consistent with the notion that the unobservables relating to quality of spouse and likelihood of
marriage are more closely aligned for men than for women. However, we might expect that
over time, as women become more “like men” in terms of human capital variables, and as
marriage markets and roles become more symmetric, the selection patterns will converge as well.
The analysis can be further refined in a number of ways. For instance, the outcome
“marriage” is the net of two choices: the decision to marry, and the decision not to divorce. In a
more dynamic framework the model can be generalized to allow for distinct types of transitions.
While selection effects on most of the education variables were modest, the marked
difference between the OLS and selection correction coefficients on White raises questions about
estimates of partner choice models or marriage matching patterns in general when selection
effects have not been taken into account.
The results have implications for policy measures, such as reducing the marriage penalty
in the tax code and funding counseling programs for marriages in conflict, aimed at stemming
the decline in marriage. There is substantial positive selection into marriage. We cannot expect
the individuals responding, at the margin, to marriage promotion policies to realize the same
outcomes as those who entered into marriage autonomously.
