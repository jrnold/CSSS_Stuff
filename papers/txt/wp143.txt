Abstract
Background. Formal demography has a long history of building simple models of age schedules
of demographic quantities, e.g. mortality and fertility rates. These are widely used in demographic
methods to manipulate whole age schedules using few parameters.
Objective. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorizes a matrix into three matrices with
useful properties including the ability to reconstruct the original matrix using many fewer, simple
matrices. This work demonstrates how these properties can be exploited to build parsimonious
models of whole age schedules of demographic quantities that can be further parameterized in
terms of arbitrary covariates.
Methods. The SVD is presented and explained in detail with attention to developing an intuitive
understanding. The SVD is used to construct a general, component model of demographic age
schedules, and that model is demonstrated with age-specific mortality and fertility rates. Finally,
the model is used (1) to predict age-specific mortality using HIV indicators and summary measures of age-specific mortality, and (2) to predict age-specific fertility using the total fertility rate
(TFR).
Results. The component model of age-specific mortality and fertility rates succeeds in reproducing
the data with two inputs, and acting through those two inputs, various covariates are able to
accurately predict full age schedules.
Conclusions. The SVD is a potentially useful as a way to summarize, smooth and model agespecific demographic quantities. The component model is a general method of relating covariates
to whole age schedules.
Comments. The focus of this work is the SVD and the component model. The applications are
for illustrative purposes only.
Keywords: Singular Value Decomposition, SVD, Age-specific Model, Component Model, Mortality,
Fertility, Predicting demographic age schedules.

Introduction

A long-standing pursuit of formal demography is the construction of empirical models of quantities
that vary predictably by age (Coale and Trussell, 1996). Model life tables (e.g. Coale and Demeny,
1966; United Nations. Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, 1982; Murray
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2013) and various mortality models (e.g. Wilmoth et al., 2012; Heligman
and Pollard, 1980) aim to identify and parsimoniously express the regularity of mortality with age,
and some fertility models (e.g. Coale and Trussell, 1974) do the same. Because age is a strong
predictor of these quantities, age profiles of these quantities from different populations, times and
places are correlated. This fact allows us to take advantage of the singular value decomposition
(SVD), a classic and long-standing result in mathematics (Stewart, 1993), to construct a general,
parsimonious, weighted sum-based model of the age pattern of demographic quantities that can
incorporate covariates and be used to make predictions.
The SVD has been used before in demography. Building on earlier work by Wilmoth et al. (1989),
Lee and Carter (1992) use the SVD to generate a rank-1 approximation of the residual produced
by subtracting the mean from a matrix of log mortality rates, effectively yielding a least-squares
solution for an under-determined part of their model (Wilmoth, 1993; Good, 1969, and Section
3.1, Equation 8). This is similar in spirit to what we develop below but solves a different, specific
problem and does not identify or develop the generalizable features of the SVD of age-correlated
quantities or in a general sense exploit the properties of the reduced-rank form of the SVD. Later
Wilmoth et al. (2012) again use the SVD in a similar way to characterize the age-pattern of residuals
in the their Log-Quad model. In earlier work (Clark et al., 2009; INDEPTH Network [Prepared by
Samuel J. Clark], 2002; Clark, 2001; Sharrow et al., 2014) we have developed and used a precursor
of the weighted sum, component model that we fully develop below, and in the most recent iteration
we use the SVD to construct the components - without fully exploiting its capabilities. Finally,
Fosdick and Hoff (2012) develop a separable covariance model and demonstrate it using age-specific
mortality. This work focuses on the covariance model of the mean-subtracted mortality rates and
like the others does not identify or develop the general implications of the generic SVD for agecorrelated quantities.
The purpose of this work is to discuss the SVD in detail and demonstrate how it can be used to
develop a general, parsimonious model of demographic quantities correlated by age. The intended
audience is demographers who might want to use the model. With that in mind the presentation is
intuitive with an emphasis on geometric interpretations rather than mathematically rigorous, and
it is supported by several fully worked examples. There are many mathematical presentations of
the SVD elsewhere, e.g. Good (1969); Kalman (1996); Strang (2009).
The remainder of the article begins with a detailed presentation of what the SVD is and how
it is related to principal components analysis (PCA). That is followed by a re-expression of the
SVD of a data matrix X in a form that expresses each column vector of X as a weighted sum of
increasingly less consequential terms. That result is used to develop a general, parsimonious model
of demographic age profiles, and finally, that model is explored and demonstrated thoroughly using
mortality and fertility data from the Agincourt health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS)
in South Africa (Kahn et al., 2012).

The Singular Value Decomposition

This section presents the SVD drawing on Strang’s presentation (Strang, 2009) and can be skipped
by those who do not want to know the origin of the SVD or how it relates to PCA.

2.1

Sketch of a Linear Algebra Derivation of the SVD

Imagine an arbitrary m × n linear transformation (or data matrix) X. The row-space of X contains
vectors with n elements in Rn , and the column-space vectors with m elements in Rm . The SVD
results from the identification of an orthonormal basis V in the row-space of X that when transformed by X yields another orthonormal basis U in the column-space of X, potentially stretched
by a diagonal matrix with positive entries S,
XV = US
X = USV

(1)
−1

,

and because V is orthogonal,
X = USVT .

(2)

Equation 2 is the SVD of X. The column vectors of U are the ‘left singular vectors’, the column vectors of V are the singular vectors, and S is a diagonal matrix containing the ‘singular
values’.

2.2

The Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis

The natural question now is how to identify U, V, and S. Beginning with U, we examine the SVD
of XT X. XT X is special because it is positive and semi-definite, all of which means it has a wellbehaved eigen decomposition with real, pairwise orthogonal eigenvectors (when their eigenvalues
are different) and positive or null eigenvalues. Using Equation 2 and the fact that UT U is the
identity matrix (because U is orthogonal),
XT X = (VSUT )(USVT )
= VS2 VT .

(3)

The right-hand side of Equation 3 is the eigen decomposition of XT X which means that V contains
the eigenvectors of XT X and the elements of S2 are the eigenvalues of XT X. We can identify U
in a similar way by examining the SVD of XXT , which is again positive and semi-definite,
XXT = (USVT )(VSUT )
= US2 UT .

(4)

Equation 4 says that U contains the eigenvectors of XXT , and again the elements of S2 are the
eigenvalues of XXT , the same as the eigenvalues of XT X. Together Equations 3 and 4 give us a
way to identify all the components of the SVD1 .
1

In practice this is not how the SVD is generally calculated; it is generally numerically easier and less uncertain
to calculate the SVD directly (Kalman, 1996) and use the SVD to calculate eigen decompositions.

2

Those same equations explain how the SVD is related PCA. PCA is typically conducted by taking
the eigen decomposition of either the covariance or correlation matrix. In both cases the first
eigenvector lines up with the axis along which there is most variation in the cloud of data points,
and subsequent eigenvectors point in orthogonal directions and capture in decreasing quantities the
remaining variation in the data cloud, see Abdi and Williams (2010).
Both the SVD and PCA identify the same dominant dimensions in preprocessed versions of the
data matrix X (Abdi and Williams, 2010; Wall et al., 2003). Both the covariance and correlation
matrices can be calculated as XT
∗ X∗ where X∗ is a preprocessed version of X. The covariance matrix
is XT
X
,
a
centered
and
scaled
version of XT X, computed from Xms (mean subtracted) which
ms
ms
is created by subtracting the column mean from each column of X and multiplying each element of
the result by either √1N or √N1−1 . The correlation matrix is formed by additional processing of the

variables. In addition to centering and scaling by √N1−1 , each variable is normalized (to account for
different scales) by dividing by its norm, the square root of the sum of its squared elements, to form
Xmsn (mean subtracted, normalized). The correlation matrix is then XT
msn Xmsn . The eigenvectors
of the covariance matrix are the right singular vectors V of the SVD of Xms , and the eigenvectors
of the correlation matrix are the right singular vectors of the SVD of Xmsn . In both cases the
singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues.
Both the covariance and correlation matrices are effectively centered and scaled versions of the
original data, and hence both the SVD of X∗ and the eigen decomposition of XT
∗ X∗ yield primary
dimensions of the centered data cloud, and because the cloud is centered, these primary dimensions
will line up with the orthogonal dimensions of greatest variation in the cloud. As we saw above
in Equation 3 the SVD of X and the eigen decomposition of XT X identify the same primary
dimensions, but these will not necessarily line up with the dimensions of greatest variation in the
cloud of data points because the first primary dimension simply points from the origin to the data
cloud. Consequently, the first primary dimension will correspond to the dimension of maximum
variation in the cloud only if that dimension happens to lie on the line from the origin to the center
of the cloud. The characteristics of the SVD and PCA are displayed graphically in Figure 1.

3

Matrix Approximation and a useful Geometric Interpretation
of the SVD

For our purposes there is another equivalent and more useful way of understanding the SVD as a
sum of rank-1 matrices that can be rearranged to express each column of X as a weighted sum of
the column vectors of U. Below we derive this re-expression and then discuss why it is useful.

3.1

The SVD as a Sum of Rank-1 Matrices

Let the data matrix X be an arbitrary K×L matrix or real values with rank(X) = ρ; ρ ≤ min(K, L).
The rank of a matrix is the number of independent rows and columns that it has; the number of
columns and rows that cannot be expressed as multiplies of others. Intuitively this is the number
of dimensions defined or actually occupied by the column and row vectors in the matrix. Now, let
the factors of the SVD be:
• U, a K × ρ matrix whose column vectors are the left singular vectors.

Equation 8 expresses X as a sum of rank-1 matrices (each term contains a matrix constructed from
a single column vector ui , hence rank-1). The Eckart-Young-Mirsky matrix approximation theorem
(Golub et al., 1987) describes the fact that the matrices in this sum have the special property that
they account for successively less and less of the overall variability in X. For each i < ρ in Equation
8 we can form a partial sum that is an approximation of X, and each such sum obeys the constraint
that it produces the best possible rank-i approximation of X in a perpendicular, sum-of-squares
sense, i.e. its row vectors are points that are as close as possible in a Euclidean sense to the
corresponding points (row vectors) in X as can be achieved using i dimensions. Formally, the
Euclidean difference between X and the rank-i approximation X[i] is as small as possible. This can
be expressed as (Abdi and Williams, 2010; Golub et al., 1987),

X − X[i]  = Tr (X − X[i] )(X − X[i] )T = min X − X[≤i]

where X[≤i] are matrices of rank less than or equal to i, and k·k is the square root of the sum of
squared elements of the row vectors of matrix A:
q
kAk = Tr (AAT )
Intuitively, what this means is that the first term in the sum in Equation 8 produces ‘predicted’
points that are as close as possible to the actual points (in a perpendicular sense) using just
one dimension, i.e. a line. The predicted points are vectors that are multiples of the first right
singular vector v1 , and the extension/contraction factors that define them are s1 u1 , easiest to see
in Equation 7. The second term in the sum produces vectors that are multiples of the second right
singular vector v2 , similarly with weights equal to s2 u2 , that when added to the vectors defined by
the first term produce predicted points that are a little closer to the actual points. This pattern
continues through the sum until the last term adds multiples of the last right singular vector and
finally completes a vector sum that reproduces the actual points exactly.
Because each successive approximation gets as close as possible to the actual points using the
orthonormal basis V, the first few terms cover most of the distance from the origin to the actual
points, and the remaining terms make comparatively small and often negligible contributions.
It is this property of the sum that makes it useful – the original data matrix X can be closely
approximated by a sum with (possibly many) fewer terms than the rank of X. Figure 2 is a convincing
visual display of this property of Equation 8.
There are two final points to note. The approximation condition defined in Equation 9 implies
that each term in Equation 8 is associated with a fraction of the overall ‘perpendicular’ squared
(Euclidean) distance from the origin to the points. The first term minimizes the difference between
the points and their best approximation along a single line, or conversely, maximizes the share
of the overall perpendicular squared distance from the origin to the points accounted for by the
one-term approximation. The remaining terms account for smaller and smaller fractions of this
overall perpendicular squared distance. The perpendicular squared distance accounted for by each
term is equal to the square of the singular value corresponding to that term. This fact ensures that
the singular values are always arranged in a monotonically decreasing list: s1 ≥ s2 . . . ≥ sρ , and
unless the cloud of data points is centered, s1 is much larger than the rest, and the first few are
much larger than the others. The singular values are the fraction of the total squared distance from
the origin to all of the points that is ‘accounted for’ by each new dimension vi . This contribution
can be quantified by calculating the square of each singular value and dividing that by the sum of
the squares of the singular values.
Finally, it is worth reiterating and stating explicitly that Equation 9 ensures that the right singular
vectors V point in the directions of maximum variation in the original cloud of points defined by
X, subject to the constraint that they remain perpendicular, and that the overall perpendicular
distance starts from the origin. The last condition is why data clouds must be centered in order
for the right singular vectors to point in directions that correspond to the dominant orthogonal
dimensions of the cloud and why PCA is conducted on centered data.

Each Column of the Data Matrix as a Sum of Left Singular Vectors

Interpreting the SVD as a sum of rank-1 matrices leads directly to a similar and very useful
expression for each of its column vectors. In the derivation above, just before converting to a sum

Figure 2: Illustration of the Reduced-rank Approximation using an Image. The top left panel
contains the original 1, 844 × 1, 852 color image of Mt. Adams from the east flank of Mt. St. Helens.
The image is a three-dimension array containing one 1, 844 × 1, 852 matrix of [0, 1] values (one value for
each pixel) for each primary color red, blue and green. The SVD was used to decompose each of the three
matrices, and then they are reconstructed using the number of terms in Equation 8 indicated in their label.
The image in the lower right panel uses the maximum number of components (1,844) and reproduces the
original exactly. With just 6 components (0.3% of the information in the original, or 99.7% compressed) all
fundamental aspects of the image are in place, the colors are close to their correct values, and it is possible
to detect that there is a bicycle in the photo; with just 24 components (98.7% compressed) the entire scene
is interpretable with high confidence, and with 96 components (94.8% compressed) you would not know you

of matrices, we express the SVD as a matrix of sums, one for each column. Equation 6 says that
each column vector x` in X can be written
x` =

ρ
X

si v`,i ui .

(10)

i=1

This is the key equation that we have been building up to. Equation 10 says that we can write all
the columns in X as weighted sums of the left singular vectors scaled by their corresponding singular
values, and it tells us what the weights are, namely the `th elements of each corresponding right
singular vector. Moreover, because of the nature of the reduced-rank approximations described
above, we know that these sums have the property of concentrating most of the variation in the
first few terms, and consequently we only need the first few terms to produce predicted values that
are very close to the actual values. This allows us to closely approximate the columns of X with
(potentially very) few effective parameters – just the first few weights.

A Parsimonious Model and Smoother for Vectors Similar to the Columns

x and its predicted value x
In addition to serving as a reduced-dimension, compact model for x, Equation 24 can also be
thought of as a smoother. By not including the higher-order, small magnitude terms in the sum, it
is possible to eliminate the small, less systematic, mostly stochastic differences between the elements
in x. What is left when only the first few terms are included are the systematic differences between
the elements of x that are shared by all or the majority of the column vectors in the data matrix
whose SVD produced the singular values and left singular vectors used in Equation 24 to produce
the approximation of x. This is a common use of SVD that has been applied in many fields for
many purposes, e.g. signal processing, image compression and clustering.

Following this general form, below we work an example with three specific points in two dimensions.

First, we identify the singular vectors v1 and v2 . The requirement is that the first singular vector
point in a direction that maximizes the sum of squared distances along this dimension to all of
the points, or conversely, minimizes the sum of squared differences between the points and their
predicted values, i.e. their projections onto this new dimension. Given the simplicity and symmetry
of this example, we can readily see that v1 must be in the direction of the red vector labeled ‘v1’
in Figure 3. The projections of point 1 (2,1) and 3 (1,2) onto this new dimension are both the
point where line segments b, c, d, f, g, k & l meet, and point 2 (1,1) actually lies on this dimension
already.
√ A final
√ requirement is that the length of the singular vectors be 1, so we choose the point
− 0.5, − 0.5 to define v1 , whether it points down and the left or up and to the right does not
matter, and it is easier to see in the figure if we define it like this.
v2 must be perpendicular to v1 , and the only option in this two-dimension example √
is along
√ the

direction of the green vector labeled ‘v2’ in Figure 3. We choose v2 defined by − 0.5, 0.5 ,
again to ensure its magnitude is 1.
Second, we calculate the singular values s1 and s2 and demonstrate how these are related to the
total sum of squares. The total sum of squares is the sum of squared perpendicular distances from
the origin along each original dimension X, Y to the three points, in order 1–3:

SStot = p2 + j 2 + m2 + n2 + i2 + o2
(18)
= 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12
The first singular value s1 is the square root of the sum of squared distances from the origin to
each point on the dimension defined by the first singular vector v1 , again in order 1–3:

Using the original X, Y dimensions, the sum of squared perpendicular
distances associated with

either the X or Y dimension is p2 + m2 + i2 or j 2 + n2 + o2 = 12 + 12 + 22 = 6, or 12 for
both dimensions combined. The SVD identifies a new set of dimensions such that a majority of
the squared distance to the points is along the ‘primary’ new dimension and the remainder along
the secondary new dimension(s), in this case 11 along the first and 1 along the second.
Finally, we identify the left singular vectors u1 and u2 . From the first term in Equation 14 we see
that the product of u1 and the first singular value s1 multiplies (extends or contracts) the X and Y
elements of v1 , and similarly, the product of u2 and the second singular value s2 multiplies the X
and Y elements of v2 . To calculate the values of the elements of u1 we take the X and Y distances
to the projections of the points along the the first right singular vector v1 and divide them by s1 v11
in the case of the X dimension or s1 v21 for the Y dimension. Using values from the example along
the X dimension:

u11 =

The result is the same in both cases, as it must be.
Similarly from Equation 14 we see that u2 multiplies the X and Y elements of v2 to create vectors
in the v2 direction that when added to the vectors produced by extending v1 by u1 yield the original
12

points. This time the numerators may have a negative sign because we are projecting the vectors
obtained by subtracting the extended versions of v1 described just above from the original points,
and the resulting vectors are not all in the 1st quadrant. Again using values from the example in

how

Starting with point 1, we go out, then come back in for point 2, and finally back out again for point
3. If the dimension defined by v1 is age-specific, then u1 is a scaled age pattern.
Finally, turning our attention back to Equations 16 and 17, we see that the column vectors of X
are expressed as weighted sums of the u’s scaled by their corresponding singular values, and the
weights are the elements of the row vectors of V. Each term in these sums is a fraction of the
distance along the original X and Y axes from the origin to our three points. Because the first
13

left singular vector is associated with the new basis direction along which there is most ‘squared
distance’ from the origin, the first term in these weighted sums represents the largest fraction, with
subsequent terms accounting for smaller and smaller fractions. This allows us to approximate the
column vectors in X with a subset of the terms in these weighted sums. In our two-dimension
example, we have just two terms; with the first we have a reasonable approximation of the column
vectors of X, and with both we reproduce them exactly. In this re-expression, the first column

The SVD and Demographic Quantities Correlated by Age

In this section we turn to a practical application of the SVD in demography.

4.1

Demographic Quantities Correlated by Age – Age Schedules

Various demographic quantities including age-specific mortality and fertility are correlated by age.
The data used in the examples in the Section 5 is displayed in Figure 8 and reveal the very strong
age-dependance that is typical for both mortality and fertility. The pair-wise correlation coefficients
for the two-sex (female joined to male in one 38-element vector) age-specific log mortality schedules
plotted in Figure 8 are ≥ 0.90 in all cases. Likewise the log age-specific fertility schedules have
pair-wise correlation coefficients that are no less than 0.99.
14

This feature of many age-specific demographic quantities makes them amenable to direct decomposition using the SVD. Imagine organizing the age schedules into a matrix A so that each age
schedule is a column and each age (group) is a row; a G × H matrix of age-specific quantities.
Geometrically, each of the G rows in this matrix corresponds to a point in H-dimension space,
and together the points defined by the rows make up the cloud of data points that we want to
characterize using the SVD. In order to make the SVD interpretable and to retain the original
scale of our data so that we can model them without translation (e.g. centering) or rescaling (e.g.
normalizing), we need to be sure that the primary dimension identified by the SVD – the first
right singular vector v1 – is lined up with the dimension of maximum variability in the cloud of
points representing our age schedules. Remember that the first right singular vector points from
the origin to the center of the cloud, which means that the primary dimension of the cloud must
be or be very similar to the first right singular vector in order to make the SVD of the uncentered
cloud useful.
The fact that demographic age schedules are correlated by age and none are offset, or moved, along
the age axis means that the distance from the origin to each point along each of the H axes is
similar, that is, the points in A all lie roughly on a line that intersects the origin and has ‘slope’
≈ 1. Of course when the number of columns exceeds three, one cannot visualize this line, but the
fact still holds for an arbitrary number of dimensions (columns).
This can be seen easily by imagining just two age schedules. In that case we have a simple twocolumn, two-dimension data set that corresponds to a cloud of G points on a familiar two-dimension
X, Y plot. Now imagine plotting the points that correspond to the age schedules. Because the
values are similar for each age group, the distance along both axes is similar for every point, and
all the points cluster around a line with slope ≈ 1, see Panel (A) in Figure 4.
It is also generally true that the primary dimension identified by the first right singular vector
also captures the vast majority of the variation in the cloud of points. This is obvious when one
notes that this dimension effectively captures the level or magnitude of the indicator by age, the
differences that are on the vertical axis if each age schedule were plotted by age. The remaining
orthogonal axes identified by the remaining right singular vectors capture the remaining variability
in the cloud; variability that is age-specific but largely unrelated to the overall level or magnitude
of the age schedule.
Figures 4 and 5 display an example of the geometry of the SVD using two mortality age schedules
from the example data listed in Appendix A Table A.6.
In summary, the first right singular vector v1 will always identify a dimension that is close to the
primary dimension of the cloud of points defined by the age schedules, and this dimension will be
associated with the overall level of the indicator by age. Additional orthogonal dimensions identified
by the remaining right singular vectors will capture the remaining variability, most of which will
be age-specific but not closely related to the overall level of the age schedules.

4.2

A General, Parsimonious, SVD-derived Model for Demographic Quantities
Correlated by Age

Demography is largely about understanding the structure and dynamics of populations, and a key
underlying dimension of ‘structure’ is age. Consequently demographers measure and manipulate
age schedules of various quantitates – e.g. mortality, fertility, nuptially, migration, etc. – in many

green vector pointing up and to right from origin is first right singular vector v1 ; small brown vector
pointing up and to left from origin is second right singular vector v2 . Long green vector pointing
down and to left is projection along v1 corresponding to female point 7, and short brown vector from
the tip of the long green vector to female point 7 is the projection along v2 corresponding to female
point 7. Adding the two projections of the right singular vectors produces the long red vector from
the origin down and to the left that defines female point 7.

ways. To make these tasks easier, and to make it possible to relate age schedules as a whole (i.e.
an indicator across all ages) to various covariates or predictors, it is desirable to have parsimonious
models of complete age structures that can incorporate covariates. These can then be used to:
• smooth noisy age schedules,
• fill-in or extend incompletely measured age schedules, and/or
• produce full age schedules using one or a small number of parameters and/or predictors of
those parameters.
The objective of the model we develop below is to provide a general modeling framework for whole
age structures that requires very few (usually just two or three) parameters. A framework of this
type can then be used to summarize the empirical regularities in any collection of age schedules
correlated by age, and further the parameter values that replicate the observed age schedules can
be themselves modeled as functions of covariates. Those models can then be used to generate
parameter values from the covariates, which can in turn can be turned into full age schedules
by the model. The final result is an empirical model that can be driven either directly by the
parameters themselves or by the covariates used to generate parameter values. This provides a
mechanism by which to predict full age schedules from the covariates.
4.2.1

Data and Model Objectives

As above, the data consist of a G × H matrix A of age-specific quantities. The columns of A
correspond to the age schedules, and the rows contain the values of the indicator for each age or
age group. Each row is a point in RH corresponding to an age group; the number of points equals
to the number of ages or age groups. The objective of our model is to summarize the shape of the
cloud of points as parsimoniously as possible using well-behaved and interpretable parameters. A
secondary objective is to be able to remove random ‘noise,’ i.e. stochastic variation, that is not
systematically related to either age or anything else. Finally, we would like to be able to identify
natural groups or clusters of these points, if they exist. Cleanly separated clusters would indicate
that there are groups of age schedules that are similar to one another but systematically different
from all the others. If true, this is an important feature of the empirical data that likely results
from some underlying mechanism (that could be explained) and can be exploited to improve our
ability to both fit and predict age schedules using the model.
4.2.2

The Model – Summarizing Empirical Regularities

Given a G × H matrix A of age schedules, the SVD of A yields a set of age-varying components
and corresponding weights that can be used to reconstruct the h ∈ {1 . . . H} individual age schedules in A to within arbitrary precision using a weighted sum based on the Eckart-Young-Mirsky
formula,
bh =
a

c
X

v hi · si ui ,

(23)

i=1

b h + rh .
ah = a
where rh is a residual; v hi , si and ui come from the SVD of A; and c is chosen so that krh k is small
enough to satisfy the desired level of precision. Taking the age-varying components (si ui ) as fixed,
18

Equation 23 is a c-parameter model for the age schedules in A. Because of the concentration of
bh is a smoothed or de-noised version
variation in the first few new dimensions (V) of the SVD, a
of ah , and experience indicates that in most cases c ≤ 3 is sufficient to adequately reproduce all
of the ah . For a given matrix of age schedules A Equation 23 will have very high ‘within sample’
validity, i.e. it will be able to reproduce all of the ah in A to within arbitrary precision (by adjusting
c).
Equation 23 is also useful in an ‘out of sample’ sense to represent age schedules that are not
included in A, as long as they are similar to those in A. Geometrically a new age schedule adds
a new dimension to our cloud of H points, and to be similar to the age schedules in A, this new
dimension has to preserve the overall shape of the cloud rather than pulling or pushing it in a new
way, i.e. having lower or higher indicator values at a given age compared to the schedules in A.
This is unlikely to be a problem if A is large and diverse with respect to age schedules.
When used in this out-of-sample way, Equation 23 needs to be modified to specify that the agevarying components come from the SVD of a particular matrix of age schedules A, and further
that although the weights do not come from the SVD of A they are defined with respect to the
age-varying components from A,
b=
Aa

c
X

A βi

· AΛi ,

(24)

i=1

b + Ar .
a = Aa
where Ar is a residual; the AΛi = Asi Aui and come from the SVD of A; and the A βi are chosen
to minimize k Ar k for a given c. For an arbitrary age schedule a, a reasonable set of A βi can be
identified easily through OLS regression of the age schedule on the c age-varying components AΛi ,
subject to the constraint that the intercept is 0. Taking the AΛi as fixed parameters, the age
schedule a is represented by the small number of effective parameters A βi , i ∈ {1 . . . c}, where c is
typically much smaller than the number of age groups in the age schedule. This feature of Equation
24 generally makes it a very parsimonious representation of complete age schedules.
The model is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 using the smoothed three-period example data listed in
Table A.6 in appendix A. Panel (A) of Figure 6 displays the log mortality schedules along with
the three components AΛi calculated from the SVD of the schedules. Based on our understanding
of the SVD of uncentered data clouds, we expect the first component to ‘locate’ the cloud, i.e. to
correspond to the distance from the origin to the cloud and therefore to contain values that are well
clear of zero, and in the case of log mortality rates, all negative. Further we expect the remaining
dimensions to capture variability within the cloud, and therefore to contain values of generally
smaller magnitude that fall on either side of zero. The remaining panels of Figure 6 contain
reconstructions of the three mortality schedules and display each of the weighted components
A βi · AΛi , their sum, and finally the data that their sum reconstructs. Figure 7 displays the partial
reconstructions of each of the three mortality schedules using 1, 2, and 3 components. The last
panel of Figure 7 graphically displays the weights applied to each component and makes clear
that the pattern of weights clearly differentiates the three schedules. It is this fact that is used to
categorize age schedules into clusters by identifying common patterns of weights using a clustering
algorithm, see Section 4.2.4.

adding the second component (brown) produces schedules that are very close to the data (or match the data
as for the first period), and adding the third component (black) matches the data perfectly. Panel (D):
The weights applied to each component to reconstruct the original values. Black is period 1, red is period

4.2.3

Parameters as Functions of Covariates – Predicting Age Schedules

If there is a systematic relationship between age schedules and an interesting covariate, then Equation 24 indicates that the relationship will also hold between the A βi , i ∈ {1 . . . c} (hereafter A βi 0 )
and the covariate. Quantifying the relationship between the covariate(s) and the A βi 0 allows the
0
0
A βi to be predicted from the covariate, and then the age schedule from the resulting A βi . This
is an efficient way to characterize the relationship between whole age schedules and interesting
covariates, and perhaps more usefully, to be able to predict whole age schedules from covariates,
even just one. We have applied this idea to an earlier version of the component model of mortality
in the context of HIV-related mortality (Sharrow et al., 2014). We will demonstrate it in several
examples with both mortality and fertility below.
4.2.4

Identifying Clusters in Collections of Empirical Age Schedules

Now we turn again to the cloud of points associated with a matrix A of age schedules. As we
mentioned above, if there are groups of age schedules in A that are similar to each other and
largely different from the other age schedules in A, then there will be clusters of points in the cloud
defined by A. Because of the strong age dependence of all of the age schedules, geometrically these
clusters will all be ‘long and thin’, lying close and roughly parallel to a line through the origin and
the center of the cloud. Even if we could visualize things in 4+ dimensions, it would be hard to
identify and separate these clusters.
The SVD of A helps solve this problem. Just as the calculated weights did just above when we
were thinking about predicting age schedules from covariates, the first few age-schedule- (h) and
component- (i) specific weights vhi in Equation 23 capture most of information necessary to define
each individual age schedule in A, and moreover, they quantify the contribution of orthogonal
components to each age schedule. Together these properties make them ideal inputs to clustering
algorithms such as Mclust (Fraley and Raftery, 2002, 2009) that automatically identify clusters and
label their members. We demonstrate this below.

Examples
Example Data: The Agincourt HDSS, South Africa

The models we develop below will be demonstrated using mortality and fertility data from the
Agincourt HDSS in South Africa. The Agincourt HDSS has monitored roughly 90,000 people for
22 years between 1992 and the present Kahn et al. (2012). The entire population of the study area
is included in the study, and each household is visited annually to update records on vital events,
migrations and a variety of other topics. These records allow us to categorize aggregate observed
person-time at risk of death and the counts of births and deaths by time, sex and age, and in the
case of births, age of the mother as well. This allows us to calculate age-specific event-exposure
rates for mortality and fertility through time. Tables A.6, B.7, B.8, C.9 and C.10 in appendices
A – C contain the data used in the examples, and Figure 8 displays the data. The purpose of the
examples is to illustrate and demonstrate the structure and various uses of the general model, not
to extract substantive conclusions about the age-profiles of mortality and fertility at Agincourt.
In keeping with that aim, the data have been smoothed in both time and age in order to remove
22

distracting stochastic features and to prevent any meaningful substantive interpretation. The timesex-age-specific counts of deaths, births and all/female person years were smoothed in both age and
time using a customized kernel smoother. The Agincourt data were chosen for this purpose because
over the past fifteen years mortality has changed dramatically in response to the HIV epidemic in
South Africa and this has produced a series of unusual and often difficult-to-model age patterns of
mortality. There is a publicly available version of the Agincourt mortality and fertility data available
from the INDEPTH Network public data repositories (http://www.indepth-ishare.org/ and
http://www.indepth-ishare.org/indepthstats/).

Component Model for Mortality

In this and following Sections 5.2 – 5.2.1 we define and demonstrate a component model of mortality.
We use the example mortality data listed in Tables B.7 and B.8 and displayed in Figure 8. The data
consist of annual female and male age-specific mortality rates for ages 0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14, . . ., 85+
for years 1993–2011. We take the log of these mortality rates and concatenate the female and male
age schedules for each year into a single 38-element vector. This is done to ensure that time-specific
features of mortality are coupled for females and males. The data also contain covariates: HIV
prevalence (% of population), ART Coverage (% of population), expectation of life at birth (years),
adult mortality 45q15 , and child mortality 5q0 . Using the component model for mortality, we are
able to predict mortality age schedules using these covariates.
The component model of mortality follows the general SVD-based component model in Equation
24. For these example data we calculate the SVD of the 38×19 matrix AM of concatenated femalemale log mortality rates (38 sex-age groups and 19 calendar years). Following the description of
the general model in Section 4.2.2, we use the left singular vectors and singular values to construct
mortality components AMΛi = AMsi · AMui . The first four singular values AMsi , i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} are
23

123.8, 5.1, 1.7, and 1.2, with the remaining singular values < 1.1. Consequently the new dimensions
associated with the first four right singular vectors account for 99.8%, 0.2%, 0.02%, and 0.009%
respectively of the total sum of squared perpendicular distances to all of the 38 points in the data
set (see Section 3.1). This indicates that the first two new dimensions effectively account for all of
the variation in the original data (the remaining variation is lost in rounding error when presenting
the results with a readable number of significant figures). Consequently we adopt the following
dimension-reduced model with two components,
bt =
AMm

2
X

AM βi,t

· AMΛi ,

(25)

i=1

mt =

bt
AMm

+ AMrt .

b t is the predicted sex-age mortality schedule for year t; AM βi,t are the weights applied to
where AMm
the first two components AMΛi (left singular vectors scaled by their corresponding singular values);
and AMrt is the difference between the predicted and ‘real’ sex-age mortality schedule, possible
to calculate when t is one of the years included in the AM but otherwise an unknown residual
when the model is used to predict a mortality schedule not included in AM. Equation 25 is a
two-parameter model for sex-age schedules of mortality covering the years 1993–2011. The two
components AMΛi , i ∈ {1, 2} are plotted in Figure 9.
The result of predicting the annual mortality schedules using Equation 25 and the first and second
weights from the SVD of AM (the right singular vector weights as in Equation 23) are displayed in
Figures D.18 – D.21 in Appendix D. The fits are very close; the total mean absolute error (MAE) is
0.080 (|m
b − m| across both sexes and all years), and the five-number summary2 of the distribution
of absolute errors is (0.0013, 0.0322, 0.0651, 0.1100, 0.3000), Table 3. The predictions are compared
to the real values in a scatterplot in Figure 14, Panel A.
Knowing what we do about the SVD applied to demographic quantities correlated by age, this is
not surprising. The real value in our model is the ability to interpolate and extrapolate, and we
demonstrate that in the next section using various covariates.
5.2.1

Mortality Age Schedule Covariates and Predictors

As described in Section 4.2.3, a useful feature of the component model is the ability to relate covariates to age schedules through the weights. The basic idea is to model the weights in terms of the
covariates and then use that relationship to predict the weights and hence the age schedules. Here
we demonstrate this capability with the covariates listed in Tables B.7 and B.8. Life expectancy 0e
is a measure of overall level of mortality, HIV prevalence is the fraction of the population infected,
ART coverage is the fraction of the population receiving antiretroviral therapy, child mortality 5q0
is the probability of dying between birth and age 5, and adult mortality 45q15 is the probability of
dying between ages 15 and 60, conditional on surviving to age 15. The fraction of the population
that is HIV+ but not on ART is the group of people who die as a result of HIV and is referred to
as ∆ = (HIV prevalence − ART coverage) from now on.
First we have a look at the weights associated with each age schedule that emerge from the SVD of
the mortality schedules. In our two-dimension model, these are the first two right singular vectors
vi , i ∈ {1, 2} (v1 for the first component and v2 for the second component), displayed by year
2 st

1 , 25th , 50th , 75th and 99th quantile.

Figure 9: Two Components of the Dimension-reduced Models of Mortality and Fertility at
Agincourt. Panel (A): Mortality components. The black line is the first component – the scaled first
left singular vector AMΛ1 from the SVD decomposition of Agincourt log mortality rates. The red line is the
second component – the scaled second left singular vector AMΛ2 . Notice that the first component is well
below the x-axis, reflecting the fact that it ‘locates’ the cloud of mortality points. The second component
crosses the x-axis because it fine-tunes the location of the mortality points within the cloud. Panel (B):
Fertility components. Same as Panel (A) for log fertility rates.

in Figure 10. Figure 11 displays the time trends in 0e and ∆. It is clear that both v1 and v2 are
strongly related 0e in a positive, linear sense and related to ∆ in a negative linear sense. These
relationships are displayed in Figures 12 and 13 which confirm that they are both approximately
linear. Based on this we used OLS regression to estimate two linear models that relate the v’s to
the covariates through time t,

and these predicted v’s can in turn be substituted back into Equation 25 to produce predicted
sex-age schedules of mortality, net of the error r. The results of doing this are plotted in Figures
B.22 through B.25 in Appendix B. As the figures make clear, the predicted values are very close
to the real values. The total MAE (calculated as before) for the predicted values is 0.083, and the

A similar exercise was conducted to predict sex-age schedules of mortality using child mortality
5 q0 alone, adult mortality 45 q15 alone and child and adult mortality together. The predictions
are displayed in Figures B.26 – B.37, and the predictions and their errors are characterized in
scatterplots in Figure 14. Similar to the predictions discussed already, in all cases the predictions
are very close to the real values. The distributions of absolute errors are described in Table 3 and
Panel (F) of Figure 14. The distributions are similar with medians around 0.065 and interquartile
28

ranges around 0.85, except for child mortality which is only slightly worse. This makes sense
because child mortality covers only five years at one end of the age schedule and therefore does not
contain as much information as the other predictors; nonetheless, it still does well.

predicted from child mortality 5 q0 . Panel (D): Weights predicted from adult mortality 45 q15 . Panel
(E): Weights predicted from child 5 q0 and adult 45 q15 mortality. Panel (F): Boxplots of distributions of absolute error in predictions of Agincourt log Mortality. The letters on the horizontal axis
correspond, in order, to the panels of this figure.

5.2.2

Identifying ‘Common’ Age Schedules of Mortality

The sequence or ‘pattern’ of weights applied to the first few components in a SVD-based component model contain the information necessary to reconstruct the original data to within a level of
precision related to the number of components used in the model. Treating the components as
fixed parameters, the weights themselves contain all the information. As described in Section 4.2.4
and illustrated in Figure 7, it is possible to use the information contained in the weights to identify
similar age schedules, and hence groups of similar age schedules.
We briefly demonstrate this potential using the log Agincourt mortality schedules discussed above
in Sections 5.2 and 5.2.1. We examine the first two right singular vectors of the SVD of AM
29

which contain the weights used to reconstruct the rank-2 version of AM. Treating these as a
two-dimensional, compact representation of the age schedules contained in AM, we use the modelbased clustering algorithm Mclust (Fraley and Raftery, 2002, 2009) to identify clusters of similar
row vectors in the matrix formed by the first two right singular vectors,


|
|
v1 v2  .
(30)
|
|
Mclust simultaneously identifies the optimal number of clusters and classifies each row of the dataset
into one of the clusters. Applied to the nineteen Agincourt mortality schedules, Mclust identified
four clusters – 1: 1993–1997, 2: 1998–2002, 3: 2003–2008, and 4: 2009-2011. Within each of
these clusters, we calculated the median values of v1 and v2 and reconstructed the log mortality
age schedules for each cluster using those median values, displayed in Figure 15. These form the
‘characteristic’ smoothed (reduced-dimension) age patterns for each of the periods identified by
Mclust.
Theses periods are substantively sensible – 1: pre-HIV (no hump, generally low mortality), 2:
developing HIV epidemic and no ART (hump developing and child mortality increasing), 3: height
of HIV epidemic and beginning of sporadic roll-out of ART (very pronounced effects of HIV), and
4: ART available, coverage continuing to increase and mortality-reduction effects of ART beginning
to be felt (attenuation of HIV-related mortality).

5.3

Component Model for Fertility

In this and following Sections 5.3 – 5.3.1 we define and demonstrate a component model of fertility,
following the same general procedure as we employed for mortality in Sections 5.2 – 5.2.1. We use
the example mortality data listed in Tables C.9 and C.10 and displayed in Figure 8. The data
consist of annual age-specific fertility rates for ages 15–19, 20-24, . . ., 45-49 for years 1993–2011.
In what follows we work with the log fertility rates. The data also contain one covariate, the total
fertility rate (TFR). Using the component model for mortality, we predict fertility age schedules
using the TFR.
As with mortality, the component model of fertility follows the general SVD-based component
model in Equation 24. We calculate the SVD of the 7 × 19 matrix AF of log fertility rates.
Following the description of the general model in Section 4.2.2, we use the left singular vectors and
singular values to construct fertility components AFΛi = AFsi · AFui . The first four singular values
AFsi , i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} are 33.64, 1.76, 0.22, and 0.18, with the remaining singular values < 0.13.
Consequently the new dimensions associated with the first four right singular vectors account for
99.7%, 0.3%, 0.004%, and 0.003% respectively of the total sum of squared perpendicular distances
to all of the 7 points in the data set (see Section 3.1). This indicates that the first two new
dimensions effectively account for all of the variation in the original data (the remaining variation
is lost in rounding error when presenting the results with a readable number of significant figures).
Consequently we adopt the following dimension-reduced model with two components,
b
AF ft =

2

AF βi,t

· AFΛi ,

i=1

ft = AF b
ft + AFrt .

Age (years)
Figure 15: Four Characteristic Age Patterns of Agincourt Log Mortality Rates. The Mclust
clustering method was used to identify four groups of similar weights on the two components retained in the
reduced dimension model of Agincourt mortality. The model patterns generated using the median weights
for each group are 1: 1993–1997, 2: 1998–2002, 3: 2003–2008, and 4: 2009–2011.

where AF b
ft is the predicted age-specific fertility schedule for year t; AF βi,t are the weights applied to
the first two components AFΛi (left singular vectors scaled by their corresponding singular values);
and AFrt is the difference between the predicted and ‘real’ age-specific fertility schedule, possible
to calculate when t is one of the years included in the AF but otherwise an unknown residual
when the model is used to predict a mortality schedule not included in AF. Equation 31 is a
two-parameter model for age-specific schedules of fertility covering the years 1993–2011. The two
components AFΛi , i ∈ {1, 2} are plotted in Figure 9.

As we did with mortality, we can construct a model of the weights that predict fertility in Equation
31 using a covariate to predict the weights. For fertility we will use the TFR or overall level as
our predictor and see if we can accurately predict the age-pattern of fertility from TFR. The time
trend in the TFR is displayed in Figure 16, and the relationship between the TFR and the first
two right singular vectors of the SVD of the age-specific fertility rates AF is displayed in Figure
17. The relationships between the v’s and TFR is linear but less strong than the relationships
between the v’s for mortality and their predictors. Nonetheless, we model each with a simple linear
equation and estimate the coefficients with OLS. The results are displayed in Tables 4 and 5 with
structures exactly analogous to Equations 26 and 27 used for the mortality model above in Section
5.2.1.

schedules displayed on their natural scale in Figures E.38 to E.41 in Appendix E. The MAE for the
prediction errors across age groups and years on the log scale is 0.0834, and the five-number sum32

mary is 0.0021, 0.0167, 0.0395, 0.0795, 0.6440. As with mortality the predictions are surprisingly
close to the data given the single predictor; this can be verified visually by looking at the Figures

Discussion

The SVD is a classic matrix decomposition that factorizes an arbitrary matrix into three new
matrices with useful properties. The right singular vectors V identify a new orthonormal basis
for the row vectors or points in the original matrix; the singular values correspond to how much
variation among the points in the original matrix is captured by each of the new dimensions; and
for each point, the left singular vectors U stretch or shrink the new dimensions, scaled by their
singular values, into a set of vectors whose sum locates the original points.
The SVD can be reorganized into a different form – the Eckart-Young-Mirsky formula – that
expresses the original matrix as a sum or rank-1 matrices, and it has been shown that truncated
sums of these rank-1 matrices represent the best reduced-rank approximations of the origin matrix
in a perpendicular least squares sense. An intermediate step on the way to deriving the EYM
formula expresses each column vector in the original matrix as a weighted sum of the left singular
vectors scaled by their singular values, with the weights being the right singular vectors. Because

they are equivalent to the EYM form, these weighted sums have the property that the first few
terms contain the vast majority of the information necessary to represent the columns in the original
matrix. This allows each column in the original matrix to be closely approximated by a weighted
sum with potentially very few terms. Not including the remaining terms also eliminates ‘noise’, i.e.
small magnitude variation that is not age-specific, and this provides a principled means by which
to smooth the columns in the original matrix.
The SVD can be applied directly to age schedules of quantities that are correlated by age because
data with that property are always arranged in a multidimensional cloud whose primary axis or
dimension is very close to a line that intersects the origin. This ensures that the first right singular
vector derived from an SVD of these data is approximately lined up with the primary dimension
of the cloud, and this in turn provides a standard interpretation of the first new dimension v1 and
more importantly the first left singular vector u1 . u1 for a set of points correlated by age is the
principal shape of the age schedule with age, and the remaining u’s are age-specific deviations on
that main shape, and typically only the first few represent systematic age-specific deviations, with
the rest effectively being noise.
Combining our understanding of the SVD and the fact that the SVD of demographic quantitates
correlated by age behaves in a predictable and interpretable way, we propose a general ‘component
model’ of demographic quantitates correlated by age. This model given in Equation 24 represents
an arbitrary age schedule as the weighted sum of components derived from the SVD of a matrix of
similar age schedules. The weights can come from the SVD that is used to define the components
(if one wants to reconstruct or smooth the original data matrix) or by estimating an OLS linear
regression model of an arbitrary age schedule as a function of the components, with no intercept.
The model can be used for a variety of purposes including:
• to smooth age schedules;
• to (dramatically) reduce the amount of information necessary to represent a large number of
age schedules;
• to represent a single age schedule with a small number of weights, typically 2–3, by treating
the components as fixed parameters;
• to predict new age schedules by supplying values for the weights, and
• to cluster age schedules by applying a clustering algorithm to the weights.
A particularly useful application of the component model is to use it to represent age schedules as
a function of arbitrary predictors or covariates. This is done by modeling the right singular vectors
of the SVD used to create the components as functions of the predictors. These models can be
used to predict the weights using values supplied for the predictors/covariates, and the predicted
weights can then be used to predict the age schedules. This is a simple and general way to relate
covariates to whole age structures and likely has many applications.
We demonstrate all of these properties and uses of the component model using example data
from the Agincourt HDSS site in rural South Africa. The component model is able to accurately
34

reconstruct age-specific mortality and fertility rates starting with the original SVD-derived weights
and/or weights predicted using simple models of the observed relationships between weights and
covariates.
