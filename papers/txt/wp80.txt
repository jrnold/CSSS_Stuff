Abstract
We investigate country heterogeneity in cross-country growth regressions. In contrast to the previous literature
that focuses on low-income countries, this study also highlights growth determinants in high-income (OECD)
countries. We introduce Iterative Bayesian Model Averaging (IBMA) to address not only potential parameter
heterogeneity, but also the model uncertainty inherent in growth regressions. IBMA is essential to our
estimation because the simultaneous consideration of model uncertainty and parameter heterogeneity in standard
growth regressions increases the number of candidate regressors beyond the processing capacity of ordinary
BMA algorithms.
Our analysis generates three results that strongly support different dimensions of parameter heterogeneity. First,
while a large number of regressors can be identified as growth determinants in Non-OECD countries, the same
regressors are irrelevant for OECD countries. Second, Non-OECD countries and the global sample feature only
a handful of common growth determinants. Third, and most devastatingly, the long list of variables included in
popular cross-country datasets does not contain regressors that begin to satisfactorily characterize the basic
growth determinants in OECD countries.

1. Introduction
Over the last two decades there has been a massive effort to use cross-country datasets to
identify key determinants of economic growth. Much of this empirical investigation has been
based on the implicit assumption of homogeneity across countries, which led to a search for
global determinants of growth. However, the assumption of homogeneity in cross-country
growth regressions has been criticized repeatedly (see e.g. Temple, 2000; and Durlauf,
Johnson and Temple, 2005). In general, this objection applies to any socioeconomic dataset
but the assumption of a common underlying data generating process seems particularly
inappropriate when analyzing such complex entities as countries (Brock and Durlauf, 2001).
The mounting evidence against “country homogeneity” has given rise to a literature
investigating growth patterns in groups of countries that share common characteristics. This
branch of research focuses either on particular variables (e.g., initial GDP) or particular
regions (Africa, Latin America) that distinguish subsamples.1 In this paper we revisit the
issue of country heterogeneity but from a perspective that has been largely ignored by the
empirical growth literature. We focus on identifying growth determinants in high-income
(OECD) countries, to understand the structures that drive the riches in industrialized
countries that developing nations attempt to emulate. In essence, our goal is to understand the
driving forces behind sustained economic success, with the assumption that such successful
growth paths are determined by a unique set of variables. Eicher and Leukert (2006)
previously explored parameter heterogeneity among OECD and Non-OECD countries, but
did not account for model uncertainty or a large number of potential regressors.
Our estimation approach includes both parameter heterogeneity, to allow countries to
represent diverse objects, and model uncertainty, to account for the fact that economists do
not know the single “true” growth model. More specifically, we utilize Bayesian Model
Averaging (BMA) to address model uncertainty and expand the methodology to integrate
structures that allow for the examination of parameter heterogeneity. Simultaneous
consideration of model uncertainty and parameter heterogeneity has previously been
computationally prohibitive, as it exceeded the computational limits of existing model
averaging algorithms. This is due to the large numbers of candidate regressors that emerge
from the long list of potential growth regressors and relevant interaction terms that are
required to test for parameter heterogeneity. To resolve the computation limitations we
employ an innovative modification of BMA called Iterative Bayesian Model Averaging

1

(IBMA) developed by Yeung, Baumgarner and Raftery (2005) for genomics applications.
The key intuition of IBMA is that it applies traditional BMA iteratively on a reduced set of
variables. Each iteration contains a set of variables that is sufficiently small to be processed
by existing algorithms. Iterations continue until the complete set of candidate regressors has
been processed at least once.
We obtain three key results that highlight different dimensions of country
heterogeneity. First, of the large number of regressors that are effective in the global sample,
only about half are also effective in the Non-OECD sample. This is surprising, since the large
number of countries in the Non-OECD sample were thought to be providing most of the
explanatory power for the global results. Secondly, our analysis shows that in Non-OECD
countries new regressors become highly effective that were ineffective in the global sample.
Many of these newly effective variables are highly intuitive, for example the primary export
share, black market premium, average population age. Third, the OECD subsample shares
few regressors with the global sample (6 out of 20); this leads us to conclude that the
particular dataset does not contain the variables that identify determinants of growth of the
fortunate in the past 30 years. There are also stark difference between OECD and the NonOECD sample where only half of the variables overlap.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a summary of BMA
and IBMA methodologies used in our econometric estimation. Section 3 discusses the crosscountry dataset used, and presents the benchmark regression specification based on which we
perform IBMA. This section also presents and examines the estimation results. Section 4
presents robustness analyses of our results to alternative modifications of the sampler used by
IBMA. Section 5 concludes and offers directions for future research.

2. Estimation Methodology
The basic idea behind model averaging is to estimate the distribution of unknown parameters
of interest across different models. The fundamental principle of model averaging is to treat
models and related parameters as unobservable, and to estimate their distributions based on
the observable data. In contrast to classical estimation, model averaging copes with model
uncertainty by allowing for all possible models to be considered, which consequently reduces
the biases of parameters.

Leamer (1978) first emphasized that the uncertainty inherent in competing theories
should be accounted for in the empirical strategy. Levine and Renelt (1992) examine the
robustness of cross-country growth determinants using Leamer’s (1983) extreme bounds
analysis. They show that the conclusions as to which regressors represent robust growth
determinants depends on the researcher’s test criteria. Extreme bound analysis has since been
shown to be excessively strict, selecting too few “effective” regressors (see, Sala-i-Martin,
1997 for a criticism of this approach relevant to growth regressions).
An additional drawback of extreme bound analysis has been the absence of a formal
structure to manage the large number of possible models. Levine and Renelt (1992) choose to
reduce the set of models to be examined by always including Initial Income, Investment
Rates, Secondary School Enrollment Rate, and Population Growth Rate in each regression.
Sala-i-Martin (1997) used the same method, but he chose to always retain Initial Income,
Investment Rates and Life Expectancy. Fixing the number of regressors that must appear in
each regression has a direct effect on the size of the estimated coefficients (see LeonGonzalez and Montolio, 2003) and it limits the number of models that are explored.
Since the first approaches to model uncertainty, a consensus has formed to apply
Bayesian techniques to account for model uncertainty (see e.g. Fernandez, Ley and Steel
2001a,b; Brock and Durlauf, 2001; Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer and Miller 2004; and
Masanjala and Papageorgiou, 2007a,b). Model averaging strategies asks the researcher to
specify candidate regressors that are clearly linked to distinct and specific theories. Bayesian
Model Averaging then allows for any subset of regressors to appear in a given model. This
technique was first developed by Moulton (1991), and Palm and Zellner (1992), but
computational issues initially hampered its implementation.2 Since our methodology is based
on BMA, we provide a brief overview of the method.
2.1 Bayesian Model Averaging
Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) accounts for model uncertainty by averaging over
all possible models, where each model’s weight is given by its posterior model probability.
The statistical foundation for BMA is documented extensively in excellent introductions by
Raftery (1995) and Hoeting et al. (1999). Raftery (1995) and Raftery, Madigan and Hoeting
(1997), followed by many others, have shown that BMA provides improved out-of-sample
predictive performance compared to predictions that are conditioned on any one model.

(1997) and Hoeting et al. (1999).

We restrict ourselves to highlighting the crucial intuition behind the methodology and
then provide an explanation of the specific approach that we implemented together with the
methodological innovations. In typical cross-country growth regressions, model uncertainty
arises due to the fact that the researchers must choose between regressors that are associated
with competing theories. With k possible variables in a linear regression model, BMA
potentially considers the entire model space of 2 k regression models. The posterior

probability that BMA assigns is simply the conditional probability after all relevant data has
been taken into account. Posterior probabilities are calculated using Bayes' theorem, utilizing
the researcher-specified prior probability and the likelihood function.
Formally, consider n independent replications from a linear regression model where
the dependent variable is per capita GDP growth, y, is regressed on an intercept, α , and
candidate regressors chosen from a set of k variables in a design matrix Z of dimension n × k .
Assume that the rank of the matrix of regressors is r (ιn : Z ) = k + 1 , where ιn is an ndimensional vector of ones. Further define β as the full k-dimensional vector of regression
coefficients. Now suppose we have an n × k j submatrix of variables in Z denoted by Z j .

Then denote by M j the model with regressors grouped in Z j , such that
y = αιn + Z j β j + σε ,
where β j ∈ ℜ

kj

(0 ≤ k

j

≤ k ) groups regression coefficients corresponding to the submatrix

Z j . The exclusion of any given regressor in a particular model implies that the corresponding
element in β is zero. σ ∈ ℜ + is a scale parameter and ε follows an n-dimensional normal
distribution with zero mean and identity covariance matrix.
Since Bayesian Model Averaging allows for any subset of variables in Z to appear in
any model M j , thus there are 2 k possible sampling models. BMA specifies that the posterior
inclusion probability of any given parameter of interest is the weighted posterior distribution
of that quantity under each of the models. The specific weights are provided by each model’s
posterior model probability. The posterior inclusion probability can then be expressed as the
weighted sum of the posterior probabilities of all models that contain the regressor of interest

P∆| y = ∑ P∆| y , M j P( M j | y ) .

where l y ( M j ) , is the marginal likelihood of model M j that is given by

l y ( M j ) = ∫ p( y | α , β j , σ , M j ) p(α , σ ) p( β j | α , σ , M j )dα dβ j dσ .

(4)

The sampled model corresponding to equation (1) is given by p( y | α , β j , σ , M j ) , and the
priors for the intercept and the regressors are p(α , σ ) and p( β j | α , σ , M j ) , respectively.
We will define the priors below.
The implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging is subject to three challenges.
First, the number of models that must be estimated increases with the number of regressors at
the rate of 2 k . As a result, the number of summation entries in equations (2)-(3) can be
enormous; a primary aim of BMA research has been to obtain efficient samplers that avoid
exhaustive sampling. Such intensive calculations quickly become infeasible as 30 candidate
variables imply over 1 billion candidate models. Second, the computation and evaluation of
the integrals implicit in equation (4) may be difficult because they may not exist in closed
form. In that case numerical solutions of the integral can further burden estimation efficiency.
Third, the choice of the prior distribution specification is always contentious in Bayesian
analysis. BMA requires the specification of two types of priors: a) prior model probabilities,
p(M K ) , and b) prior parameter distribution p(θ K , M K ) .

With respect to the prior model probabilities we follow the common practice in the
literature and assume a uniform distribution over the model space, which expresses each
model as equally likely. It follows that the prior model probability is 2-k, which renders the
prior probability of including any given candidate regressor equal to 0.5 (see e.g., Raftery et
al., 1997; and Fernandez, Ley and Steel, 2001a,b).3
The decision on the prior structure for the individual regressors is a potentially
divisive issue. BMA requires the researcher to inject priors into the analysis, however these
prior can be so diffuse that clear parallels to frequentist inference can be established.
3
Mitchell and Beauchamp (1988) discuss the possibility of alternative model weights and Sala-i-Martin,
Doppelhofer and Miller (2004) argue forcefully in favor of greater weights on smaller models. Brock, Durlauf
and West (2003) suggest a tree structure to take into account similarities among regressors.

5

Extensive work has been conducted on the appropriate prior structure to obtain either data
dependent priors (Raftery, Madigan and Hoeting, 1997), “automatic” priors (Fernandez, Ley
and Steel, 2001b), or the Unit Information Prior (UIP). Eicher, Papageorgiou and Raftery
(2007) systematically study the effects of model and regressor priors on predictive
performance within a BMA framework to highlight the importance of a prior benchmark.

for a given dataset.
In our choice regarding the priors on the parameters space we follow Raftery (1995)
and impose the diffuse UIP. The UIP can be derived from frequentist statistical principles
(Kass and Wasserman 1995), and it is seen as a conservative prior that is sufficiently spread
out over the relevant parameter values and reasonably flat over the area where the likelihood
is substantial. Specifically, it is a multivariate normal prior with mean at the maximum
likelihood estimate and variance equal to the expected information matrix for one observation
(Raftery, 1999). It is also a special case of the preferred Fernandez, Ley and Steel (2001b)
priors and it is closely related to the prior structure in Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer and Miller
(2004). The advantage of the UIP is that it allows for a simple approximation of the marginal
likelihood with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The BIC approximation is viewed
as conservative fitness measure to evaluate model performance. If anything, BIC is biased
against finding an effect of a given regressor (i.e. it favors the null hypothesis β=0).4
The one crucial departure from previous applications of model averaging in
economics is our sampling and estimation methodology. Fernandez, Ley and Steel (2001a,b)
use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Model Composition (MC3) sampling algorithm
developed by Madian and York (1995) to search the model space, while Sala-i-Martin,
Doppelhofer and Miller (2004) use a “stratified” Coinflip sampler. MC3 is a technique that
allows for sampling of complex high dimensional distributions as it simulates a random walk
across the search space to converge at a stationary posterior distribution. The MC3
distribution of the sampled draws depends on the last value drawn. In contrast, the stratified
Coinflip sampler samples one set of regressions using the prior probability sampling weights
and then uses the approximate posterior inclusion probabilities calculated from those
regressions for the subsequent sampling probabilities.

See e.g. Raftery (1995). For a more detailed discussion of the UIP and BIC, see Raftery (1999) and the
discussion in Hoeting et al. (1999).

Given that MC3’s computational limit was no more than 60 candidate regressors,5 the
Coinflip sampler had the advantage of handling more candidate regressors. However, the
larger the search space the more difficult was for Coinflip sampler to converge. For example,
in some BMA experiments we run with more than 70 candidate regressors there was no (or
unacceptably slow) converge simply because the number of models becomes too large.
Our method follows Raftery (1995) who established that the UIP allows for a Laplace
approximation of the marginal likelihood and thus renders a search across the entire model
space obsolete. To further simplify the computational demands Raftery (1995) suggest the
Leaps And Bounds All Subsets Regression Algorithm of Furnival and Wilson (1974) to reduce
the candidate model space further.6 The Leaps algorithm performs an exhaustive search for
the best subsets of candidate variables for predicting the dependent variable in linear
regression; it returns a specified number of best models for each model size.7 Generally, the
qualitative differences based on the different samplers are small but not negligible.
Computationally, the Leaps sampler is by far the most efficient. This efficiency is crucial to
handle the large number of models as we tackle model uncertainty and parameter
heterogeneity by interacting the global variables with regional dummies, which substantially
increases the size of candidate regressors.
2.3. Iterative Bayesian Model Averaging

The computational limit of the Raftery and Volinsky (1996) BMA algorithm (bicreg)
is 54 candidate regressors. To address parameter heterogeneity, the interaction of regressors
increases the domain of regressors from 41 to a possible 82, which implies 4 septillion (100
billion x 4 trillion) models. In addition, the simple act of interacting variables in a small
dataset may lead the number of regressors to exceed the number of observation, such that the
design matrix is no longer of full column rank.
To overcome these problems we introduce the Iterative BMA (IBMA) algorithm to
economics that was initially proposed for a genome application by Yeung, Baumgarner and
Raftery (2005). Specifically, they introduced IBMA to select a small number of relevant
genes for accurate medical diagnoses from a pool of about 5000(!) genes. Our application is
simpler. After interacting our 41 regressors with an OECD treatment dummy and eliminating

5

At least until very recently. We have just discovered that the work of Ley and Steel (in this issue) extends the
computational bound of MC3 to 104 regressors. We discuss this development in the end of this section.

(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu).
7

interaction terms that are perfectly collinear or have less than 2 observations, this leaves us
with 77 candidate regressors (see the data discussion below).
The key intuition of IBMA is that it applies traditional BMA iteratively on a reduced
set of variables, z, which is small enough to be processed by traditional BMA. We define z as
the regressor window. For our application we choose a default size z = 41 and check for
robustness below. After sorting the candidate regressors by their bivariate correlations with
the dependent variable, they are added to the regressor window. After the first z regressors
have been processed by the first BMA run, q variables whose posterior probabilities do not
exceed a predetermined inclusion threshold (1 percent by default) are removed from the
regressor window and q unprocessed candidate regressors are added. BMA is then applied
again until all regressors have been considered.
There are some caveats that must be highlighted as the set of candidate regressors
expands. One limiting factor for IBMA is related to the regressor window size. While models
of size n are theoretically possible, IBMA cannot evaluate posteriors for models that exceed
size z. Hence the procedure cannot lay claim to having examined the entire model space –
which introduces possible inaccuracies if high quality models happen to be larger than z. In
our robustness section we find that variations in z in IBMA do not alter our qualitative results
in the growth dataset.
Although we provided this caveat, we can offer evidence that any concerns that z may
not cover the relevant model size are unlikely to be applicable in cross-country growth
regressions. Sala-i-Martin (1997) and Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer and Miller (2004) argue
forcefully that the expected model size should not exceed 7 regressors. Prior work by Levine
and Renelt (1992), Sala-i-Martin (1997), FLS and Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer and Miller
(2004) never generated models with more than 18 potentially relevant regressors. Hence it is
unlikely that high quality models in cross-country growth regressions contain more than 48
regressors.
New work by Ley and Steel (this issue) extends MC3 to potentially handle up to 104
regressors without the iterating procedure employed in our algorithm. The advantage being
that the entire model space, including models up to 104 regressors can actually be considered.
This also implies that the prior model size increases to perhaps an implausibly large number
of regressor, however. It remains to be seen how accurate and time intensive the new MC3
method generates convergence.

Previous work using MCMC methods, particularly in

8

applications with growth datasets, revealed that increasing the number of regressors (which
of course increases the model space exponentially) resulted in considerable increase in
computation time. Alternatively, IBMA is not limited to the number of candidate regressors
and processes the data with stunning efficiency. It also allows the researcher to avoid having
the prior model size increase linearly with the number of candidate regressors. Further
research is necessary to examine how the three existing approaches to considering large
model spaces (IBMA, modified MC3 and BACE) compete in terms of efficiency and
predictive performance. The unique advantage of IBMA over the other two approaches, at
least to date, is that it is capable of considering applications like ours where the number or
observations happen to be less than the number of potential regressors.

3. Estimation
3.1 The Data

For our analysis we adopt the FLS dataset. It is comprised of 41 variables and 72 countries of
which 23 are OECD countries. In addition, we add a dummy variable to identify OECD
countries. The dataset is a subset of the Sala-i-Martin (1997) dataset; it includes all variables
that have previously been flagged as robustly related to growth and that do not entail a loss of
observations. We choose the FLS dataset for several reasons. First, the dataset contains
variables that proxy for a broad set of competing growth theories, such as human capital,
institutional quality, religion, economic policy and geography. Hence, the dataset reflects the
theory uncertainty inherent in growth econometrics that has been highlighted by Brock and
Durlauf (2001). Second, the majority of the variables are measured at the beginning of the
period or as close as possible to it, which reduces possible endogeneity problems that can
potentially impact cross-country growth regression analyses. Finally, by choosing the same
dataset as FLS we have a natural benchmark and reference point for our analysis.
Table A1 in the appendix provides summary statistics for the global, OECD, and NonOECD samples. The high income OECD countries grew on average almost twice as fast as
the rest of the world over the period 1960-1992 (3 percent versus 1.7 percent). A first look at
the data reveals some major initial advantages OECD countries possessed over the rest of the
world. In 1960, initial GDP was about four times greater, life expectancy was 16 years
greater and primary schooling was 28 percent higher in the OECD sample as compared to the
Non-OECD sample. OECD economies also had effectively better institutions scoring higher

9

on civil liberties, the rule of law and political rights8, while ethnolinguistic fractionalization
was twice as high in Non-OECD countries.
3.2

Model Specification

To examine the possibility of parameter heterogeneity, we examine whether the data
generating process for the global sample is different from the data generating process of the
OECD sample.9 To model parameter heterogeneity we follow the approach suggested by
Brock and Durlauf (2001) and Brock, Durlauf and West (2003) and treat parameter
heterogeneity as a variable inclusion problem. It follows then that we can understand
parameter heterogeneity as a special case of model uncertainty. We therefore modify the
global equation in (1) and estimate the standard interaction model in empirical work of the
following form:
y = αι n + Z j β1, j + I X j β 2, j + σε ,

(5)

where I is an indicator variable that equals 1 if the country is an OECD member and 0
otherwise. Z is the n × k matrix of the regressors and X is a sub-matrix of Z that excludes all
variables that are either perfectly collinear in the OECD sample10 or not relevant for the
OECD sample due to negligible sub-sample variation.11 In our case with OECD interactions,
the resulting model features 77 candidate regressors and 72 observations, which renders
traditional BMA infeasible and leads us to implement the IBMA algorithm discussed above.
The direct merit of the interaction model compared to subsample regressions is that the full
information from the entire dataset is used to derive results.
Regression equation (5) can be interpreted as providing estimates for the control
group, β1i , which is in our case the sample of Non-OECD countries. It also provides the
marginal effect experienced by the treatment group, β 2i , which are the OECD countries in
our case. The actual impact of the X regressors for which we want to establish parameter
heterogeneity can then be obtained by comparing the Non-OECD effect given by the
8
Note that Civil Liberties and Political Rights are measured “backwards,” i.e. larger values imply fewer civil
liberties and political rights.
9
Theoretical underpinings for parameter heterogeneity are based on thresholds as in Azariadis and Drazen 1990,
or on fully specified models of nonlinearities as in Galor and Weil (2000), Lucas (2002) and Galor and Moav
(2002).
10
The presence of multicollinearity exacerbates the problem of distinguishing between interaction terms that
represent parameter heterogeneity and terms that are simply feature highly correlated with important
interactions. This problem is neither unique to our issue at hand (OECD interaction), or IBMA.

Excluded interactions are: Africa dummy, French Colony dummy, Fraction Hindu, Latin American dummy,
Spanish Colony dummy, Fraction Confucian and Fraction Buddha.

posterior means of β1i with the effect in OECD countries that is given by the composite
~
~
means of β i = β1i + β 2i .12 Note that the definition of the composite β i carries an important

implication: If the Non-OECD effect, β1,i , is observed to be significantly different from zero
and the OECD effect is found to be insignificant, it implies either that the marginal estimate
of the treatment group, β 2i , is estimated with great noise (e.g., with a high variance) to wash
out any significance of the composite, or that the treatment effect is indeed quite tightly
~
estimated, but of the opposite sign as, β1i , rendering the composite β i close to zero.
At this point it is important that the basic iterative routine suggested by Yeung et al.
(2005) must be modified to assure that, β1i and β 2i can appear in the same regression. Two
cases are possible. In the first case, β1i is included in a regressor window but the interaction
is not (perhaps because its initial bivariate correlation was low). The rotation of each variable
that is not in the initial regressor window does assure that β1i and β 2i are in the final
regressor window if they are both significant. In the second case, the initial regressor window
includes β 2i but not β1i , and the interaction alone is not significant. In this case the
interaction will be rotated out of the regressor window and β 2i will never have the chance to
actually interact with β1i . This case requires a modification of the Yeung et al. (2005)
procedure. In particular, we allow for two rotations in our version of IBMA. The first rotation
(as suggested by Yeung et al. 2005) assures that all regressors that were not included in the
initial regressor window will have a chance to be considered. The second rotation iterates all
regressors that have been discarded from regressor windows in the first rotation (to make
room for new regressors) once more through the window. This assures that even in the
second case, an initially discarded interaction term will have the opportunity to eventually
rejoin the global variable in a regressor window, if significant.13
Further considerations to assure that variables have been given due chance to exhibit
their true interaction significance in IBMA led us to examine the final regressor window to
see how many global terms were observed without interaction terms. As a robustness

(~ )

The composite variance is given by var β i = var (β1i ) + var (β 2 i ) + 2cov(β1i , β 2i ) .
13
The Yeung et al. (2005) algorithm also suffers from the fact that it guarantees that the covariate with the
lowest bivariate correlation is included in the final regressor window and hence in the final result. By adding
regressors in the second rotation in inverse bivariate correlation order, we also improve on this design flaw.
12

11

exercise, we executed final iterations that added interaction terms to match all significant
global regressors whose interaction terms did not appear in the final regressor window. 14
Our empirical strategy is to start by establishing the global BMA benchmark, in Table
1. Here we initially examine the potential effectiveness of variables without any interactions
specified in equation (5). Then we examine potential evidence for parameter heterogeneity.
Finally we will examine robustness and compare different regressor window sizes in IBMA
where we iterate until all covariates have been processed and the interaction terms are all
included in the last iteration.
3.3

Results

Table 1 presents our baseline results applying IBMA to examine model uncertainty
and parameter heterogeneity in the FLS dataset. In particular, Table 1 presents the coefficient
posterior means, posterior standard deviation and the ratio of the absolute value of the former
to the later, for the Global and Interaction specifications. The value of the absolute value of
the posterior mean to standard deviation ratio (post. mean/sd) is used as a measure for
identifying variable effectiveness in our growth regression exercises. While the analysis of
posterior inclusion probability speaks only to the probability of a candidate repressor’s
inclusion in the most effective models, we chose to emphasize the post. mean/sd ratio to
better tie economic and statistical significance. Raftery (1995) suggested that for a variable
to be considered as effective the posterior inclusion probability must exceed 50 percent;
which is roughly equivalent of requiring a ratio of mean/sd = 1, which implies in frequentist
statistics that the regressors improves the power of the regression. Hence, while Raftery’s
(1995) interpretation for BMA would imply a threshold value of the mean/sd ratio of about 1,
we decided to be more stringent and set the threshold value equal to 1.3, which is roughly
equivalent to a 90 percent confidence interval in frequentist hypothesis testing. We recognize
that there is no consensus in the BMA literature about this threshold, but argue that our main
results hold when this threshold is adjusted upwards or downwards.
The results for the interaction model are obtained by using IBMA with a regressor
window of size z = 41. The choice of the regressor window size is natural in that it is directly
comparable to the specification used to establish the benchmark results for the global sample.
In Section 4 we report robustness results that vary z.
14

In additional robustness analysis, we also added one global regressor that was associated with one highly
significant interaction term (Standard Deviation of the Black Market Premium) into the regressor window. This

12

[Table 1 here]

The dependent variable is growth 1960-1992 and the first column of Table 1 features
all regressors that were found to be effective (post. mean/sd > 1.3) in the global, OECD, or
the Non-OECD samples.15 Columns 2 and 3 report the coefficients for the global sample. For
this sample no interaction terms are employed, hence the number of regressors is only 41,
which allows the use of standard BMA algorithms. Of the 41 regressors considered, Table 1
reports only the relevant 31 regressors with post. mean/sd > 1.3 to save space. All regressors
excluded from the tables are ineffective in the global sample, in all subsample analyses, and
in all robustness specifications.
In the case of the global sample (columns 2, 3) no interaction terms are included,
which implicitly assumes the absence of parameter heterogeneity. Here we replicate the
results of the previous literature that assumes that OECD and Non-OECD countries are
considered to have identical determinants of their growth performance, and that the
magnitude of these determinants is also unchanged across subsamples. We find that in the
global sample, 20 of the 41 candidate variables are effective to growth. The number and the
type of regressors that we identify as effective is in line with the findings of the previous
literature. For example, Equipment Investment, Dummies relating to the colonial history,
Initial GDP, and specific country characteristics matter to growth as in Sala-i-Martin,
Doppelhofer and Miller (2004); and FLS.
In columns 4 and 5 of Table 1 we report the results generated by allowing for the
possibility of parameter heterogeneity related to the OECD group of countries. The
subsample results are classified into seven subsets. First we have 5 variables that are effective
in the global sample and in both the OECD and Non-OECD countries. These variables are
Initial GDP, Initial Life Expectancy, Equity Investment, Mining and Outward orientation.
This is the extent to which global, OECD and Non-OECD results agree. Second we find a set
of 4 variables that are effective in both the global and Non-OECD samples, but are
ineffective in the OECD sample. Variables in this set are Initial Higher Education,
Ethnolinguistic Fragmentation, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Latin Dummy. None of these
variables have an impact in OECD countries. Two of these variables, the Sub-Saharan and
Latin American Dummy, are simply irrelevant for OECD countries. For the other two the
variable was found to be important for OECD but not robust across different windows considered. Our
remaining results were unaffected.
15
Posterior coefficient estimates in bold font represent those variables that pass the effectiveness threshold
(post. mean/sd > 1.3).
13

marginal contribution, β 2 , in the interaction regression is highly significant and of the
opposite sign as β1 , which renders the composite coefficient that indicates the OECD effect,
~

β , ineffective.
The third subset of results summarized in columns 4 and 5 of Table 1 is a relatively
large set of 10 variables that are highly effective in the global sample, but once we allow for
parameter heterogeneity neither the OECD nor the Non-OECD samples can claim these
variables as growth determinants. Indeed in the interaction IBMA runs several of these
variables do not pass the 1 percent posterior probability threshold and are not even included
in the final regressor window that identifies the 41 top regressors. These cases are indicated
with “NA.”
The fourth category consists of only one variable, Rule of Law, which is effective in
the global and OECD samples but ineffective in the Non-OECD sample. The fifth category
consists of 4 variables that are not effective in the global sample but highly effective in both
the OECD and Non-OECD subsamples. The Fraction of Catholics and the Degree of
Capitalism (EconOrg) both have a positive effect in the OECD and Non-OECD sample while
the Black Market Premium and Primary Exports have a negative effect on growth in OECD
and Non-OECD countries.
The sixth category consists of 4 variables that are ineffective in the global sample, but
effective only in Non-OECD countries. This result confirms that adding high-income
countries to the global mix may drown out important effects in the developing country’s
subsample. The Average Population Age, the Fraction Protestant, Buddha and the Fraction of
the Foreign Speaking Population are highly effective in Non-OECD countries but not in the
global or OECD samples. Parameter heterogeneity thus uncovers not only crucial information
as to what are not important growth determinants in advanced countries, but also new and
important growth determinants in Non-OECD countries. Note that three of the variables that
share importance in Non-OECD countries indicate a higher coefficient for the Non-OECD
sample compared to the global sample. For two of these variables, Fraction Protestant and the
Fraction of the Foreign Speaking Population, the impact in OECD countries is even opposite
albeit ineffective. This is additional evidence that the inclusion of OECD countries in the
sample drives down the growth impact of a variable for developing countries and may render
it ineffective in the global sample. The seventh category consists of all variables that are
ineffective in either the global, OECD or Non-OECD countries.

14

4. Robustness
The key innovation of IBMA is to apply the existing BMA structure iteratively to a
computationally feasible subset of models, which we call the regressor window, z. In this
section we examine the sensitivity of this novel aspect of IBMA analysis, as we vary the size
of the regressor window. As indicated above, the previous growth literature established that
between 4 and at most 18 variables matter in growth regressions, hence it would be surprising
to obtain evidence from different window sizes that contradict our previous results. However,
larger window sizes allow for more possible combinations of variables, some of which may
not be able to attain the explanatory power unless they are placed in the models with a large
number of regressors, yet others might not attain our threshold level of effectiveness unless
they are jointly paired.

The importance of such jointness has been emphasized by

Doppelhofer and Weeks (2005) and Ley and Steel (this issue). Table 2 reports the results for
the global and the interacted sample from successively increasing regressor the window size.
The practical computational limit is reached at a window size of z = 48.
[Table 2 here]

To present the results most efficiently we have combined two columns in Table 1 to
one individual column per window size that reports the global, OECD, and Non-OECD
estimates for each relevant variable. Note that the Global estimate is only provided as a
reference; it does not change throughout since the models for all 41 variables can be
examined in BMA. Only the interaction that separates OECD and Non-OECD increases the
number of regressors from 41 to 77, requiring the application of IBMA. Overall Table 2
documents robust results, but there are important changes that we discuss in detail.
Moving from z = 41 to z = 45 generates only a few differences in the results. For
OECD countries we now find Mining to be ineffective while Non-Equipment Investment
becomes effective. Additionally, we now find the Average Population Age, Fraction
Protestant and the share of the Workforce to Total Population to be highly effective for
OECD countries. For Non-OECD countries there are only two changes among the 41 growth
determinants. The two additional variables that now register as marginally effective for NonOECD Countries are Non-Equipment Investment and the Fraction Hindu, but otherwise there
is no difference in the results. Most convincing perhaps is that the coefficient estimates are
just about unchanged.

15

As we increased the size of the regressors window past z = 45, we find slightly
augmented results. For the computationally most demanding run, z = 48, we find that a
greater number of variables matter in both the global and the Non-OECD sample. Allowing
for a larger window size increased the explanatory power for the Non-OECD determinants
initial Labor Force, the Hindu Dummy, the Spanish Dummy, the French Dummy, and NonEquipment Investment; every one of these variables was initially effective in the global
sample, but ineffective in either subsample. In addition, the War Dummy and Property Rights
are now also effective for Non-OECD, although they are not effective for the global sample.
Two variables, the Fraction Catholic and Protestant now become ineffective. For OECD
countries there are also a number of changes as 8 additional variables are added to the list of
effective variables while 3 (Mining, Rule of Law and Fraction Catholic) are dropped from
this list. On balance, however, the picture is unchanged as the evidence for parameter
heterogeneity is overwhelming.
The clear break that signifies a large increase in the variables that are effective is at

z=45. After z = 45 (see example for z = 47) the results are all closer to z = 48 than to z = 41,
that a effectively larger number of variables matters for growth in OECD and Non-OECD
countries. However, we cannot identify a single variable that remains uniquely effective for
OECD countries across the different window sizes. This is perhaps yet again more evidence
that this dataset does not contain variables that are the unique growth determinants in this
subset of countries.
The conclusions that can be reached from our robustness exercise are twofold. First,
most of our important benchmark results are quite robust to changes in the size of the
regressor window. We caution though that these results have also revealed some fragility
inherent in the regressor window approach inherent in the IBMA methodology. This should
be kept in mind when one assigns particular interpretation to certain variables. Scrutinizing
the causes for possible fragility of IBMA is beyond of the scope of this paper but we judge
this as an important area for future research.

5. Discussion
In general our results suggest that the important determinants of long-term growth in NonOECD countries overlap only to some degree with the factors identified with the global
samples. For OECD countries this overlap is even smaller. In addition, allowing for
parameter heterogeneity unveiled a large number of new variables that matter to only Non-

16

OECD countries. However, allowing for parameter heterogeneity did not allow us to gain any
meaningful insights into unique factors that determine growth in OECD countries.
We provide a Summary Table 1a to collect the results. Overall we find that a number
of purported growth determinants in the global sample are not effective for Non-OECD
countries, and that most established growth determinants do not show explanatory power for
OECD countries. Even for Non-OECD countries, 11 of the original 20 effective variables are
no longer effective. Instead, an entirely new set of variables matters in Non-OECD Countries,
where 8 variables that were ineffective in the global sample are now shown to matter. While
it is surprising to see some of the key variables in the global sample, such as Civil Liberties,
Fraction Confucius, and Primary Education, loose their significance, the newly effective
variables are all very much in line with established key indicators of growth developing
nations, such as the Degree of Capitalism, Primary Exports Share, and the Black Market
Premium.
[Table 1a here]
For the OECD the results are even more stunning. Of all the original 20 effective
variables in the global sample only 6 survive as effective. The only variables added as
effective for OECD countries by allowing for parameter heterogeneity are the Fraction of
Population that is Catholic, Primary Exports, the Degree of Capitalism, and the Black Market
Premium. The evidence for parameter heterogeneity is therefore overwhelming. Most
variables in the global dataset do not matter for OECD countries, and half of the variables
that matter for Non-OECD countries also do not matter for OECD countries. Note that this
implies (as per our discussion in section 3.2) that the OECD treatment effect is highly
significant and of the opposite sign as the Non-OECD effect to render the composite
~
coefficient for the OECD, β , insignificant.
The combined analysis of parameter heterogeneity and model uncertainty has lead not
only to quantitative differences regarding the effect of growth determinants across
subsamples, but it also generated important new qualitative implications. To our surprise the
quantitative (economic) differences between subsamples were minimal, because so few
regressors are common across subsamples. Qualitatively we find not only that regressors may
have opposite impacts in the different subsamples, but that indeed an entirely different set of
regressors matters in the global, Non-OECD and OECD samples. While the relevant
regressors for the global and Non-OECD sample can be recovered, the dataset does not

17

contain the regressors necessary to explain the OECD growth performance. This is doubly
tragic. First, policy recommendations to lower income countries can no longer be framed
within the context that improvements in any of the variables in the dataset will actually lead
to better growth outcomes. Hence we have no guidance as to what drives growth in high
income countries. But even more disturbing, the growth performance in OECD countries was
on average twice as high as in the Non-OECD samples, hence neither the determinants of the
higher income levels, nor the higher income growth rates can be recovered given the current
dataset. Two avenues can be explored to reconcile these findings. First we can collect data
that has been linked specifically to growth in OECD countries (for example on regulation, see
Nicoletti and Scarpetta et al 2003). However, hopes of expanding such a dataset to the global
sample are perhaps unrealistic. Second, the notion of one size fits all – or that one theory or
one approach to growth can address the growth determinants in disparate subsamples – might
be too optimistic.

6. Conclusion
This paper extends the literature on country heterogeneity in two dimensions. First, a new
model averaging method called Iterative Bayesian Model Averaging (IBMA) is used to
handle the exhaustive computation required when we simultaneously consider model
uncertainty and parameter heterogeneity in our estimation. Second, instead of investigating
the sources of growth (or lack of it) in low-income countries, we take a fresh look at what
determines growth performance in the high-income OECD countries.
Our analysis suggests that IBMA is a powerful technique that makes it possible for
researchers to consider a very large number of potential regressors. Our application of IBMA
to growth empirics allows us to examine parameter heterogeneity and model uncertainty
simultaneously in all regressor candidates. It reveals that a large number of regressors is
highly effective for Non-OECD countries, but irrelevant for both, OECD countries and the
global sample. Perhaps most surprising was our finding that the long list of growth
determinants included in popular cross-country datasets does not contain variables that begin
to identify the key determinants of growth in advanced countries. “Global” results that have
been taken to represent some average coefficient estimate for all countries are now shown to
provide little information about the growth determinants in two key subsamples. The Global
results have been debunked as artefacts of the combination of two heterogeneous subsamples,
and no longer as an expected impact that can identify effective growth determinants.
