Abstract
We discuss a statistical model of social network data derived from matrix representations and
symmetry considerations. The model can include known predictor information in the form of a
regression term, and can represent additional structure via sender-specific and receiver-specific
latent factors. This approach allows for the graphical description of a social network via the latent
factors of the nodes, and provides a framework for the prediction of missing links in network data.

Some key words: eigenvalue decomposition, exchangeability, prediction, singular value decomposition, social network, visualization.

Introduction

Social network data are characterized by a set of binary link variables yi,j measured on pairs of
a set of n nodes, in which yi,j indicates the presence of a link from node i to node j. Frequently
accompanying such data are vectors of predictor variables xi,j that may be specific to nodes or
pairs. For example, in a set of n schoolchildren yi,j = 1 could indicate that child i claims child j as
a friend, and xi,j could contain demographic information about the pair such as age, sex, SES and
co-residence in the same neighborhood.
Writing the network as an n √ó n matrix Y and the predictor information as an n √ó n √ó pdimensional array X, a common approach to the analysis of such data is to fit a statistical model
relating Y to X. A statistical model can provide many forms of inference, such as a description of
the relationship between Y and X, a measure of the uncertainty in this relationship via confidence
intervals, and predictions about missing or future network data. Perhaps the simplest model that
relates Y to X is the ordinary logistic regression model:
Pr(Y|Œ≤, X) =

Y
i6=j

exp{Œ∏i,j }
1 + exp{Œ∏i,j }

(1)

log odds(yi,j = 1) = Œ∏i,j = Œ≤ 0 xi,j .
Equation (1) indicates that the observations {yi,j } are assumed to be statistically independent.
Inference for the regression coefficient Œ≤ in this situation is fairly straightforward (see, for example,
McCullagh and Nelder 1983), and is provided by most statistical software packages. However,
this assumption is strongly violated in most social network datasets. In many networks there
is heterogeneity in activity levels across nodes. For example, in social settings some people are
more active than others, and on the web some pages are more heavily linked. This across-node
heterogeneity leads to within-node homogeneity of ties: The relationships {yi,1 , yi,2 , . . . , yi,n } will
often be more similar to each other than they are to other network measurements because they all
share something in common: they all involve node i. This typically is manifested statistically by
a strong within-node dependence of ties, a violation of the independence assumption in equation
(1). Other manifestations of network dependence include reciprocity and clustering. Reciprocity
is the notion that yi,j and yj,i will be statistically dependent. For example, friendship ties are
generally positively correlated. Clustering is the phenomenon in which a subset of nodes exhibit a
large number of within-group ties and relatively few ties outside of the group. This is related to
the notion of transitivity (‚Äúa friend of a friend is a friend‚Äù). See Wasserman and Faust (1992) for
more on common structures of network data.
One approach to statistical inference and modeling of such dependence patterns has been the
use of exponentially parameterized random graph models, or ‚Äúp‚àó ‚Äù models (Wasserman and Pattison
1996). In these models the log-probability of a network Y is given by a linear regression term plus
1

a linear combination of network statistics. For a single pair of nodes, the log-odds of a link from i
to j can be written as
log odds(yi,j = 1) = Œ≤ 0 xi,j + Œ±1 t1 (Y‚àí(i,j) ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Œ±m tm (Y‚àí(i,j) ).

(2)

The log-odds written above is the conditional log-odds, which indicates how the probability of
a link from i to j may depend on Y‚àí(i,j) , the data from other pairs of nodes. The statistics
t1 (Y‚àí(i,j) ), . . . , tp (Y‚àí(i,j) ) are related to the sufficient statistics and are typically functions of such
things as the total number of ties in the network, the number of reciprocal ties and the number of
transitive triangles. It is often quite difficult to estimate the parameters Œ≤ and Œ±, and the resulting
models often display considerable lack-of-fit (Snijders 2002, Handcock 2003). However, these models
are conceptually straightforward and the parameter estimates can provide a representation of the
global features of the network.
An alternative approach to modeling dependencies among relational data is the use of random
effects models. Random effects models are a cornerstone of many statistical methods for the analysis
of dependent data, although their application to the analysis of relational network data has been
fairly recent. In the context of logistic regression, such models take the form
Pr(Y|Œ∏i,j ) =
Œ∏i,j

Y
i6=j
0

exp{Œ∏i,j }
1 + exp{Œ∏i,j }

= Œ≤ xi,j + zi,j

As in (1), the data are modeled as conditionally independent given the Œ∏i,j ‚Äôs, but the Œ∏i,j ‚Äôs depend
on the set of zi,j ‚Äôs, the unobserved random effects. The zi,j ‚Äôs are then modeled to account for
potential dependencies in the data. For example, we might want to allow for heterogeneity in
the total volume of sending and receiving activity across nodes. This could be accomplished by
a model of the form zi,j = ai + bj . Although such an additive random effects model for the zi,j ‚Äôs
generally provides a drastic improvement in model fit over ordinary logistic regression, it is unable
to represent higher-order network structure, such transitivity or clustering of nodes. Recently, some
authors have taken a non-additive approach to modeling the zi,j ‚Äôs. Nowicki and Snijders (2001)
represent the probability of a link between nodes i and j as depending on their membership to a
set of unobserved latent classes. Hoff, Raftery and Handcock (2002) and Hoff (2005) model the
probability of a link as depending on the similarity of nodes i and j in a space of unobserved latent
characteristics. These types of models are able to represent standard network behavior such as
clustering and transitivity, and estimation for these types of models is generally less problematic
than estimation for models of the form (2).
In the remainder of this article we motivate a multiplicative latent factor effects model for social
network data. In this model, structure in the network is represented by the form zi,j = u0i Dvj +i,j ,
where ui and vj represent vectors of sender-specific and receiver-specific latent nodal attributes.
2

This is a more general form of the bilinear mixed-effects model discussed in Hoff (2005), in that the
characteristics of a node as a sender may differ from its characteristics as a receiver. In the next
section we motivate this type of model based on matrix representations and invariance properties.
In Section 3 we briefly discuss a method of parameter estimation using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm. Section 4 presents a data analysis of international conflict data. Using this example, it
is shown how the latent factor model can be used to graphically represent patterns in the data and
make predictions about missing network data. Undirected network data is considered in Section 5,
and a discussion follows in Section 6.

Latent variable models

Consider a model for binary network data of the form
log odds(yi,j = 1) = Œ∏i,j

(3)

0

Œ∏i,j

= Œ≤ xi,j + zi,j .

Here the regression term Œ≤ 0 xi,j represents patterns in the data related to known predictor variables
xi,j and zi,j represents any additional patterns in the data unrelated to those of the predictors. As
discussed above, one simple model for social network data is obtained by restricting zi,j = ai + bj ,
i.e. letting zi,j represent only additive row effects and column effects. In this section we motivate a
more general non-additive row and column effects model based on matrix decomposition methods,
and further justify the model by an invariance assumption for the distribution of the zi,j ‚Äôs known
as exchangeability.

2.1

Models via matrix decompositions

Let Z be an n √ó n random matrix of effects representing deviations of the log-odds Œ∏i,j from the
linear predictor Œ≤ 0 xi,j . We can write Z = M + E, where the mean matrix M represents systematic
patterns in the effects and E represents noise. A basic result from matrix theory is that every n √ó n
matrix M has the representation
M = UDV0
where
‚Ä¢ U is an n √ó n matrix with orthonormal columns;
‚Ä¢ V is an n √ó n matrix with orthonormal columns;
‚Ä¢ D is an n √ó n diagonal matrix, with diagonal elements {d1 , . . . , dn }.
3

The triple {U, D, V} is called the singular value decomposition of M. The squared elements
of the diagonal of D are the eigenvalues of M0 M and the columns of V are the corresponding
eigenvectors. The matrix U can be obtained from the first n eigenvectors of MM0 . The number of
non-zero elements of D is the rank of M.
In applications such as signal processing, image analysis and more recently large-scale gene expression data, researchers often represent the main patterns of a noisy, matrix-valued dataset with
the first few singular vectors and values of the matrix. The goal of such reduced-rank approximations is to represent the main patterns in the data matrix while eliminating the lower-order noise.
For model (3), this motivates the reduced-rank representation Z = UDV0 + E where U, D and V
all have K columns, with K << n, thus restricting M to be of rank K. Letting ui and vj be the
ith and jth rows of U and V respectively, the entries of Z have the representation
zi,j = u0i Dvj + i,j ,
which has an appealing interpretation as a multiplicative model based on row and column factors.
In this model the relationship between i and j is a product of a vector of K latent sender-specific
factors ui with latent receiver-specific factors vj , weighted by D. The model for binary network
data thus becomes
log odds(yi,j = 1) = Œ∏i,j
Œ∏i,j

2.2

(4)

= Œ≤ 0 xi,j + ui Dv0j + i,j .

Models via exchangeability

The matrix Z discussed above represents structures in the data that are not associated with known
covariate information X. The model (4) represents this structure as a function of latent row-specific
and column-specific factors, plus noise. Such a representation has a justification and interpretation
as a type of random effects model, via a concept from probability theory known as exchangeability.
An infinite sequence of random variables z1 , z2 , . . . is said to be exchangeable if for every integer n,
the distribution of {z1 , . . . , zn } is equal to that of {zœÄ1 , . . . , zœÄn } for any permutation œÄ of {1, . . . , n}.
Exchangeability is more general than independence: a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables is exchangeable, but not necessarily vice versa. Exchangeable models
are commonly used in statistics for sequences of random variables which have something in common,
but are indistinguishable in that their labels carry no information. A remarkable theorem of
de Finetti makes this concept precise: Any sequence of exchangeable random variables has the
representation zi = f (¬µ, i ), where ¬µ and the i ‚Äôs are independent random variables. Relating to
the above discussion, ¬µ is the quantity shared by all members of the exchangeable sequence and
the i ‚Äôs determines the patternless way in which they differ.
4

The concept of exchangeability extends to matrices. A matrix Z is said to be row-and-column
exchangeable (RCE) if the random variables {zi,j } are equal in distribution to the set {zœÄ1 i,œÄ2 j } for
all finite permutations œÄ1 and œÄ2 . Exchangeability in this case can be interpreted as saying that
the row labels and the column labels carry no information about Z. The analog of de Finetti‚Äôs
theorem in this case is as follows:
Theorem 1 (Aldous 1981) If Z is an RCE matrix, then there exists a function f and inded

pendent random variables ¬µ, {u1 , u2 , . . .}, {v1 , v2 , . . .}, {i,j , i = 1, . . . , j = 1, . . .} such that zi,j =
f (¬µ, ui , vj , i,j ).
d

(the ‚Äú=‚Äù above means ‚Äúequal in distribution‚Äù). This theorem says that any statistical model for
an RCE matrix can be expressed in terms of a ‚Äúgrand mean‚Äù ¬µ, row effects {ui }, column effects
{vj }, and independent disturbance terms {i,j }.
Returning to our model for social network data, the effects {zi,j } are meant to represent any
patterns in the data beyond any known covariate information X. In this sense, the zi,j ‚Äôs are
unrelated to any node-specific information we may have, and so it may be appropriate to model the
zi,j ‚Äôs as being the components of an RCE array. By virtue of Theorem 1, this justifies the use of a
model of the form zi,j = u0i Dvj + i,j , i.e., modeling the effects {zi,j } as functions of row-specific,
column-specific and dyad-specific random effects.
A less restrictive form of matrix exchangeability is the concept of weak exchangeability, under
which the random variables {zi,j } are equal in distribution to the set {zœÄi,œÄj } for any simultaneous
permutation œÄ of both the row and the column labels. Such a modeling assumption might be
desirable if one wanted to relate the outcomes involving node i as a sender {zi,1 , zi,2 , . . .} to the
outcomes involving i as a receiver {z1,i , z2,i , . . .}. In this case, it would be appropriate to develop
a statistical model in which the row effect ui of each node is correlated with its column effect vi ,
and to allow i,j to be correlated with j,i . Additive statistical models of this form for normally
distributed data have been called ‚Äúsocial relations models‚Äù (Warner, Kenny and Stoto 1979, Wong
1982), and have been extended to the analysis of binary social network data in Hoff (2005).

Parameter estimation

The unknown quantities in our model include
‚Ä¢ Œò = {Œ∏i,j }, the set of predictors;
‚Ä¢ Œ≤, the vector of regression coefficients;
‚Ä¢ U and V, both n √ó K matrices with orthonormal columns, denoted U = {U[,1] , . . . , U[,K] }
and V = {V[,1] , . . . , V[,K] };
5

‚Ä¢ D = diag{d1 , . . . , dK }, an n √ó n diagonal matrix.
Estimation of the model parameters is most easily done in a Bayesian context: Given a prior distribution on the model parameters, obtain their posterior distribution via Bayes rule, p(Œò, Œ≤, U, D, V|Y) ‚àù
p(Y|Œò, Œ≤, U, D, V) √ó p(Œò, Œ≤, U, D, V). Various posterior quantities of interest, such as posterior
means, confidence intervals and predicted values are functions of this posterior distribution. Although these quantities cannot be derived directly, they can be approximated via Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling, a type of stochastic algorithm that generates a dependent sequence of realizations of the parameters. Such algorithms can be constructed so that the empirical distribution
of the generated parameters approximates the desired posterior distribution (see, for example,
Tierney, 1994). Given starting values œà0 = {Œò, Œ≤, U, D, V} one such MCMC scheme iteratively
generates a sequence œà1 , œà2 , . . . as follows:
1. sample Œ≤ from its full conditional distribution p(Œ≤|Œò, U, D, V);
2. for k ‚àà 1 . . . , K,
(a) sample U[,k] from p(U[k] |Œò, U[,‚àík] , D, V);
(b) sample V[,k] from p(V[k] |Œò, U, D, V[,‚àík] );
(c) sample D[k,k] from p(D[k,k] |Œò, U, D[‚àík,‚àík] , V);
3. sample Œò‚àó = XŒ≤ + UDV0 + E‚àó , where E‚àó is a matrix of standard normal noise. Replace Œ∏i,j
‚àó with probability
by Œ∏i,j

‚àó )
p(yi,j |Œ∏i,j
p(yi,j |Œ∏i,j )

‚àß 1.

From a current state of the parameters œàs , one run of the above procedure generates a new set
of parameters œàs+1 . Run iteratively, the distribution of the generated samples converges to the
desired posterior distribution p(œà|Y), and posterior quantities of interest can be approximated
from the empirical distribution of the generated samples. For example, the posterior mean of Œ≤
can be approximated by the empirical mean of the MCMC samples, and the endpoints of a 95%
confidence interval can be obtained from the 2.5% and 97.5% sample quantiles. More details on
the above sampling scheme, and software to run such an algorithm, is available at my website:
www.stat.washington.edu/hoff.

Example: international conflict data

In this section we illustrate the use of model (4) with an analysis of a social network of international
conflicts among 130 nations from 1990-2000, compiled by Mike Ward and Xun Cao of the University
of Washington Political Science department. For these data, yi,j = 1 if country i initiates one or
more conflicts with country j sometime during 1990-2000. Standard practice in the international
6

relations literature is to relate the entries yi,j of the sociomatrix Y to vectors of explanatory
variables xi,j via logistic regressions of the form log odds(yi,j = 1|Œ≤, xi,j ) = Œ≤ 0 xi,j . For the analysis
in this section, xi,j is an eight-dimensional vector of regressor variables including an intercept and
the following seven predictors :
1. log populations of the aggressor nation;
2. polity score of the aggressor (a measure of democracy);
3. log populations of the target nation;
4. polity score of the target;
5. geographic distance between aggressor and target;
6. product of the aggressor polity score and the target polity score (an interaction term);
7. number of intergovernmental organization having both nations as members.
More details on the data are available in Ward and Hoff (2005). Models such as these are often used
in the political science literature to evaluate various hypotheses about the nature of international
relations. For example, it is often hypothesized that rates of conflict are lower among democratic
countries, and among countries that are co-members of intergovernmental organizations.
As discussed in Section 1, ordinary logistic regression models for such data are limited in their
ability to describe patterns in the data and typically have poor predictive performance. In the next
two subsections we show how the multiplicative latent factor model can represent higher-order
network patterns, and how predictive performance is drastically improved upon by the inclusion of
these factors.

4.1

Data description and visualization

The dataset contains information on the presence or absence of conflicts among 130 nations, giving
130 √ó 129 = 16770 binary observations. The network is very sparse, with only 1.2 % of the pairs
P
1
having links ( n(n‚àí1)
i6=j yi,j = 0.012). We fit the model
log odds(yi,j = 1|Œ≤, xi,j ) = Œ≤ 0 xi,j + ui Dv0j + i,j
to the data, with the dimension of the latent factors being K = 2. This was done by constructing
a Markov chain of length 100,000 using the algorithm described in Section 3. For simplicity, we
used independent diffuse normal(0,1000) prior distributions for the regression coefficients Œ≤ and
the diagonal elements of D. The priors distributions on U and V were taken to be the uniform
distributions on the space of orthonormal n √ó 2 matrices.

97.5% quantiles.
Figure 1 displays posterior 2.5, 50 and 97.5% quantiles of the regression coefficients of the seven
predictor variables, providing a posterior estimate and a 95% confidence interval for each. The
results indicate strong relationships between conflict and geographic distance (with higher conflict
rates between geographically proximate nations), and between conflict and population (with higher
conflict rates between countries with large populations). Less strong are the relationships between
conflict and the other predictors, but the results indicate lower rates of conflicts among democratic
countries and among countries that are co-members of intergovernmental organizations
Posterior estimates of the multiplicative latent factors are shown in Figure 2. These were
obtained from the first two left- and right-singular vectors of the posterior mean of the matrix
ÀÜ i } for each nation. The directions of these
UDV0 , yielding two two-dimensional vectors {ÀÜ
ui , v
vectors are plotted in Figure 2 for each country involved in a conflict, with the direction of uÀÜi
indicated in red and vÀÜi in blue. The size of the text for each country is related to the magnitude
of their vectors. Finally, links between countries are shown by green lines.
These latent factors indicate a large amount of structure in the data beyond that which can be
represented by a simple ordinary logistic regression with a small number of predictors. For example,
conflicts in the Middle East and Persian Gulf show up clearly as clusters of aggressors and targets
at roughly 180 and 270 degrees from the horizontal axis. Conflicts among African countries appear
on the opposite side of the circle. Note that very few links cross through the center of the circle.

This indicates that the pattern of conflicts can be well represented by these two-dimensional latent
factors.

4.2

Link prediction

When the number of nodes in a social network is large it may be difficult or impossible to make
measurements on each pair of nodes, resulting in a large number of missing values in the dataset. In
these situations it may be desirable to make predictions about the unobserved, missing data based
on the observed data. To evaluate the ability of the multiplicative latent factor model to predict
missing links, we performed the following prediction experiment on the international conflict data:
1. Randomly divide the set of n √ó (n ‚àí 1) ordered pairs of indices (i, j) into two parts, a training
set T and a test set M .
2. Estimate the parameters of model (4) using the MCMC algorithm, using the data YT =
{yi,j : (i, j) ‚àà T } and treating the data in M as missing.
exp{Œ∏

}

3. Based on the results of the Markov chain, obtain fitted values pÀÜi,j = E[ 1+exp{Œ∏i,ji,j } |YT ] for
each {yi,j : (i, j) ‚àà M }
4. Compare pÀÜi,j to yi,j for each pair (i, j) ‚àà M .
The above steps constitute one-half of a two-fold cross-validation procedure, a procedure often used
to evaluate the predictive performance of statistical models. In general, an m-fold cross validation
procedure consists of dividing the dataset into m parts, and making predictions for each part based
on parameters estimated from the remaining m ‚àí 1 parts. Note that in cross-validation, increasing
the model complexity doesn‚Äôt always improve the model fit, as the predictive performance of the
model is evaluated by predictions for data that were not used to obtain parameter estimates.
Step 1 above divided the dataset into sets T and M , each containing data on 8385 pairs of
P
countries. The number of missing links in the test set was (i,j)‚ààM yi,j = 103. Steps 2, 3 and
4 were performed for K = 0, 1, 2 and 3 to see how the predictive performance changed as the
complexity of the model was increased via the dimension of the latent factors. The results of
this prediction study are shown in two plots in Figure 3. The first plot refers to the following
scenario: Imagine that a dataset with missing information is obtained. Let the set M consist of
all pairs for which yi,j is missing. The task is to identify pairs (i, j) ‚àà M for which it is likely that
yi,j = 1, i.e. the task is to find the missing links. One strategy would be to fit a statistical model
with the available data YT , obtain predicted probabilities pÀÜi,j = Pr(yi,j = 1|YT ) for all node pairs
{i, j} ‚àà M , and then investigate the node pairs having the highest predictive probabilities of having
a link. The first panel of Figure 3 plots the results of this exercise for models with K = 0, 1, 2 and
3-dimensional latent vectors. For each value K being considered, predictive probabilities were made

for each (i, j)-pair in M based on the parameter estimates from YT . The first panel of Figure 3 tells
us how many links we would find if we were to investigate the pairs having the highest predictive
probabilities. For example, if we were to investigate the pairs in M having the top 100 predictive
probabilities using the K = 2 estimates, we would uncover 90 links, or almost 90% of the total
number of missing links. In contrast, if we didn‚Äôt use the latent effects model (K = 0) we would
uncover only 49.
The second panel of Figure 3 looks at the predictive performance in a different way. Consider
predicting yi,j for (i, j) ‚àà M as yÀÜi,j = 0 or yÀÜi,j = 1 according to whether or not pÀÜi,j < p or
pÀÜi,j ‚â• p for some threshold p. The plot displays the true positive rates Pr(yi,j = 1|ÀÜ
yi,j = 1) in
solid lines, as well as the fraction of links that are recovered Pr(ÀÜ
yi,j = 1|yi,j = 1) in dashed lines,
for various prediction criteria p. For example, if p = .25, a model with K = 2 yields a set of
predicted links in which 91.5% are true links, and the set of predicted links will include 83.5% of
the actual missing links. In contrast, if we don‚Äôt use a latent effects model these numbers will be
Pr(yi,j = 1|ÀÜ
yi,j = 1) = .711 and Pr(ÀÜ
yi,j = 1|yi,j = 1) = .311 respectively. These results show that a
two-dimensional latent factor model has dramatically better predictive performance than a model
lacking such structure, and that a three-dimensional factor model is unnecessary, given that it has
similar predictive performance to that of a two-factor model.
We suggest the following general approach to link prediction in the presence of missing data:

11

1. Let M = {(i, j) : yi,j is missing} and T = {(i, j) : yi,j is observed}.
2. Using data on pairs in T , use a cross validation procedure to obtain an optimal K and the
associated prediction and error rates.
3. Use parameters estimates from the optimal model to make predictive probabilities pÀÜi,j for
missing pairs (i, j) ‚àà M .
4. Make predictions or search for more links based on the pÀÜi,j ‚Äôs.
Cross-validation procedures obtain prediction and error rates under the assumption that the data
are missing at random. If inclusion in the set M is not random then the estimated prediction and
error rates may not be accurate. However, the results might still provide some guidance as to which
of the pairs in M are most likely to have a link.

Extension to undirected data

A social network is called undirected if it consists of binary relationships between nodes in which
yi,j = yj,i by design. In this case, a model analogous to the one developed in Section 2 can be
constructed using similar results on matrix decompositions and exchangeability. For undirected
data, we can write the model in (3) as
log odds(yi,j = yj,i = 1) = Œ∏i,j
Œ∏i,j

= Œ≤ 0 xi,j + zi,j .

where now the effects zi,j can be represented with a symmetric n√ón matrix Z. We write Z = M+E
as before, with all matrices being symmetric. Analogous to the singular value decomposition, every
square, symmetric matrix M has an eigenvalue decomposition of the form M = UŒõU0 , where Œõ is
a diagonal matrix of real numbers and U is an orthonormal matrix. This motivates a model of the
form mi,j = u0i Œõuj , giving
log odds(yi,j = yj,i = 1) = Œ≤ 0 xi,j + u0i Œõuj + i,j

(5)

with i,j = j,i . The interpretation is that the relationship between i and j is a function of the
observed predictor variables xi,j and unobserved latent factors ui and uj . As in the case of directed
network data, such a model has a justification via exchangeability: By assumption, all known
information distinguishing the nodes is contained in X, and so it is reasonable to model Z such
that {zi,j } is equal in distribution to {zœÄi,œÄj } for any permutation œÄ. The symmetric matrix Z is
thus weakly exchangeable, and a theorem of Aldous (1985) says that any model for a symmetric,
weakly exchangeable Z can be written
d

zi,j = f (¬µ, ui , uj , i,j )
12

for some function f which is symmetric in its second and third arguments.

Discussion

In the analysis of social network data it is often desirable to make inference about local network
structure. For example, it might be of interest to graphically describe regions of the network, or to
make predictions about the potential for the presence of unobserved links between a set of nodes.
This article has presented a model-based approach to making such inference. Motivated by ideas
from matrix decomposition theory and the theory of exchangeable matrices, the approach is based
on a latent variable model in which network structure is represented in terms of unobserved latent
node-specific factors. This approach allows for the graphical description of the network in terms
of the latent factors, and can make predictions about missing observations in social network data.
Software and example analyses are available at my website, www.stat.washington.edu/hoff.
