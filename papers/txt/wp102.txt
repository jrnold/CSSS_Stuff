Abstract
We describe the evolving age-pattern of mortality in a rural population living in
northeast South Africa during the growth of the HIV epidemic, 1994-2007. The likely
effect of HIV on mortality is enormous. The probability of dying for young children
and adults has risen two-to-four fold, and the expectation of life at birth has fallen
by more than fourteen years. We describe these changes in a compact way using
the interpretable parameters of the Heligman-Pollard mortality model. A Bayesian
method is used to fit this model to period-sex-age-specific mortality to yield probability
distributions for the eight parameters that govern the model, for period-sex-age-specific
mortality and for all other columns of the corresponding life tables. Trends in the
central estimates of the parameters are compared to the trend in HIV prevalence to
suggest the impact of HIV on mortality. Probability distributions of the resulting
expectation of life over time demonstrate how dramatic the changes have been.

Introduction

This work makes two contributions. The first is a detailed description of the likely impact
of HIV on period-sex-age-specific, all-cause mortality as the HIV epidemic grows in a population living in rural northeast South Africa. This is accomplished by reinterpreting the
parameters of the eight-parameter Heligman-Pollard mortality model (Heligman and Pollard, 1980; Rogers and Gard, 1991; Gage and Mode, 1993; Congdon, 1993) and fitting it to
age-specific probabilities of dying. The second is a Bayesian fitting procedure developed to
produce robust fits of the Heligman-Pollard mortality model that yield probability distributions for the parameters, the age-specific probabilities of dying and the other columns of the
corresponding life tables.
Populations with high HIV prevalence in east and southern Africa have experienced dramatic increases in mortality (Dorrington et al., 2001; UNAIDS and WHO, 2009) and corresponding declines in life expectancy (UNAIDS and WHO, 2008). Because the primary
modes of transmission of HIV in those populations are heterosexual sex and mother-tochild at birth or through breastfeeding, the majority of HIV positive people are either very
young children or sexually-active adults. Consequently there is a characteristic age-pattern
of deaths resulting from AIDS: very young children who progress through the disease quickly
and middle-aged adults who are HIV positive for roughly ten years before dying of AIDS.
Adult women living with HIV are typically several years younger than HIV positive men
because women tend to have sex with slightly older men.
Using prospectively collected data from people of all ages in a population of roughly 69,000
living in rural northeast South Africa (Kahn et al., 2007), we look for these signature effects
of HIV on sex-age-specific mortality through time. Because we expect to see important
changes in child mortality and a well-defined ‘hump’ in the age-pattern of mortality for
adults, we summarize the age-pattern of mortality using the eight-parameter HeligmanPollard mortality model (Heligman and Pollard, 1980). This model decomposes the agepattern of mortality into three pieces, each with a small number of parameters to control it.
There are three parameters to describe child mortality (A, B & C), three to describe a very
flexible accident hump typically occurring in young adulthood (D, E & F ) and finally two
parameters to describe mortality at older ages (G & H). Recognizing that the ‘accident’
hump could just as easily represent the much larger bulge in the age-pattern of mortality
for adults dying of AIDS, we reinterpret this as the ‘AIDS’ hump and apply the model with
this interpretation in the South African setting.
The Heligman-Pollard Model is fit to age-specific mortality schedules describing different
periods of the HIV epidemic to yield a time series of values for the parameters A-H. Because
each parameter independently controls a specific component of the shape of the age-pattern
of mortality, the parameters have specific interpretations. Consequently the time series
of parameter values describes changes in the age-pattern of mortality in a succinct and
informative way. For example, different values of D, E & F describe changes in the location,
level and spread of the adult mortality hump as HIV becomes increasingly prevalent.

The Heligman-Pollard model is a natural choice in this application, and consequently it
is surprising that it has not already been used to describe HIV-related mortality. The likely
explanation is that it is hard to fit the Heligman-Pollard model using standard procedures
such as minimization of squared errors (Rogers, 1986; Dellaportas, 2001). Our solution
is to apply the Bayesian melding method (Poole and Raftery, 2000) that has the added
advantage of properly quantifying uncertainty in the estimated parameters and the mortality
age-patterns output by the model. The resulting probability distributions of the parameters
and mortality age-patterns are used to argue that significant changes have occurred to the
age-pattern of mortality in ways that are consistent with the effects of HIV.
This paper is organized in an unconventional way. Following the sensible suggestions of
Ehrenberg (1982), the next section presents Results, followed by Detailed Findings, Methods,
Background & Significance and finally a Discussion. Last are Appendices A – E with the
data and additional results. In this order the reader moves to increasingly detailed treatment
of the work starting with a clear understanding of where it is going. The aim is to present
the material in a convenient organization that reflects how we actually read papers, keeping
in mind that the bulk of readers are most interested in the key results and an overview of
the method. The most casual reader can stop after the Abstract, readers who are interested
but do not need the real details can stop before Section 3 Detailed Findings, and readers
who need all the details can read through the remaining sections.

Results & Recommendations

We fit the Heligman-Pollard model to empirical age-specific probabilities of dying describing
mortality of men and women living in the Agincourt Study population (Kahn et al., 2007)
during the periods 1994-1997, 1998-2001, 2002-2004 and 2005-2007. The HIV epidemic in
this population grew dramatically over that period with a steep rise in prevalence during
the mid-to-late 1990s, see Table 1. With this in mind, the periods are chosen to capture
as much variability in the age-pattern of mortality as possible. Given the lag between HIV
infection and death, we expect mortality to be related to prevalence five-to-ten years earlier,
so the HIV prevalence estimates listed in Table 1 are for the four periods roughly five years
before to the periods we use to fit the data. Figure 1 displays the period-specific fits for men
and women, each period in a different color. For each period the light-colored dots in the
background are the data, the solid lines are the median fitted curves and the dashed lines
define the 95% credible interval around the median, which are not required to be symmetric.
The radical increases in age-specific mortality are obvious: massive increases for infants and
very young children and for adults aged roughly 15-65. The increases are not uniform with
age and peak for men in the early 40s and for women slightly younger. The corresponding
decreases in life expectancy are listed in Table 1: men lost fifteen years of life expectancy, and
women lost fourteen. The substantive objective of this work is to decompose these changes
into their constituent parts and relate those parts to changes in HIV prevalence.

Main Findings

The Heligman-Pollard model represents the age-specific probability of dying with a parametric curve controlled by eight parameters. Table 2 names the eight parameters and briefly
describes what they do in the model, and Table 3 presents the median parameter estimates
and 95% credible intervals. Figure 2 plots the estimated values of parameters A, D, E and
F over the four periods in our study. Parameter A relates to the level of child mortality,
and parameters D, E and F control the hump or bulge in adult mortality: D ∼ height of
the hump, E ∼ width of the hump and F ∼ location of the hump along the age axis.

Child Mortality

The increase in child mortality during the period when the HIV epidemic grows is reflected
by increases in parameter A which is roughly the probability of dying between ages one and
two, 1 q1 . The upper-left panel of Figure 2 displays a clearly upward trend in the value of
parameter A for both male and female children. The vertical dashed lines in this figure are
the credible intervals around each point estimate. A quick visual comparison of the credible
ranges reveals unambiguous increases in parameter A during the first two intervals and a
possible decrease during the last interval.
2.1.2

Adult Mortality

Parameters D, E, F , G and H control adult mortality. We focus on D, E and F because
they control the hump while G and H define underlying adult mortality. The plots in Figure
2 reveal striking changes in the hump parameters (upper right and lower two panels). The
level parameter D increases steadily over all three intervals. The increases from one period
to another actually become larger and larger for men, and the same is true for women up
to the last interval. For both sexes the increases are very significant with very little to
no overlap in the credible intervals from one period to the next. Although men appear to

have slightly higher humps in all periods, the differences between the sexes are small and
insignificant except for the last period when women have a substantially lower hump. These
movements in parameter D relate directly to the growth of the mortality bulge observed
for adults, and the highly regular and significant changes (i.e. non-overlapping credible
intervals) demonstrate how large and important the increases in adult mortality have been.
Trends in the width parameter E (inversely related to the width of the hump) indicate
that over time the hump has become significantly wider for women and somewhat wider for
men, with both converging to a fairly wide configuration and staying that way. Changes
in the location parameter F (location of the hump on the age axis) reveal that the hump
has steadily become ‘older’ for women and became ‘younger’ and then ‘older’ again for men.
During the last three periods, the location of the hump has not changed dramatically for
women or men, staying around age 40.
2.1.3

HIV Prevalence

Figure 3 displays the median parameter values for A, D, E and F along with the corresponding HIV prevalence five years earlier from Table 1. The period labels near each point
on the plots correspond the the mortality estimation periods associated with the parameter
values. The HIV prevalence values come from periods five years before the label on each
point. The gray dashed line in each panel is a simple OLS regression line to help the eye
assess the linearity of the relationship between the parameter values and HIV prevalence.
For all periods and both sexes, the level parameters A and D increase with HIV prevalence,
except for A during the final period. During the final interval the overall level of child
mortality is reduced, perhaps reflecting the success of programs to limit mother-to-child
transmission (for a brief review see Doherty et al., 2007). The largest increase in level is in
the second interval (between the second and third periods) for women coming just after the
largest increase in prevalence; the largest increase for men occurs in the last interval after
ten years at high prevalence.
For parameters E (spread or width of hump) and F (location of hump) the relationship
with earlier prevalence is less neat but still regular and in-line with expectations. For both
sexes there is a downward slope to the relationship between E (width of the hump) and earlier
prevalence indicating that as prevalence increases the hump becomes gradually wider; this
is especially the case for women whose hump starts off much narrower than men’s.
For men the location of the hump moves from ∼ 45 to ∼ 38 and then back up to ∼ 42.
In contrast, women have experienced a consistent ‘aging’ of the hump moving from ∼ 31 to
∼ 40. This indicates the age locus of the mortality impact of HIV for men has hovered at a
little below age 40 while for women it has moved steadily to older ages and is now at about
the same age as men.

Life Expectancy

Table 4 reports expectation of life at birth and age ten for the four periods for both sexes, and
Figure 4 plots the median expectation of life schedule with 95% credible intervals. There was
a precipitous decline in life expectancy over the entire period with the largest drops occurring
between the second and third periods for both sexes. At the beginning of observation during
1994-1997 a male infant could expect to live 67.3 years, and a female infant 73.5. By the end
during 2005-2007, a male infant expected only 52.2 years and a female 59.4. Men lost 15.2
years of life expectancy, and women lost 14.2. Judging from the credible intervals, change
over the whole period is very significant, with the bulk of the significant drop between periods
two and three.
The expectation of life at age ten is not affected by child mortality and consequently
describes adult mortality more clearly. Table 4 shows clearly that the majority of the changes
in the expectation of life at birth result from changes in adult mortality; the changes in e10
closely track, and in the most recent period exceed, the changes in e0 . The timing of this
trend in the expectation of life is consistent with the rise in HIV prevalence. Given a mean
survival time of 9-11 years between infection with HIV and death, we expect and indeed
observe rapid increases in mortality at about the turn of century, reflecting increases in HIV
prevalence during the 1990s, see Table 1.

Estimation Method

To succinctly summarize mortality at all ages we use the eight-parameter Heligman-Pollard
mortality model (Heligman and Pollard, 1980). The Heligman-Pollard model provides a
mathematical expression that defines a flexible, smooth curve with enough degrees of freedom
to replicate most of the features of ‘standard’ mortality age schedules, including a flexible
hump. We chose the Heligman-Pollard model specifically because it has this hump which
can be used to fit the bulge in adult mortality resulting from AIDS deaths. The aim is to
identify values for the eight parameters that produce a curve that matches a set of mortality
measures at various ages. The set of eight parameter values is then the compact, interpretable
description of mortality that we want, and the curve they represent is a smoothed version of
the empirical data. Fitting the model in this fashion is challenging because the number of
parameters (eight) is large in comparison to the number of data values in a typical age-pattern
of mortality (20). This means the model is on the verge of being over-parameterized, a
10

situation in which any number of combinations of parameter values produce similar outputs,
and consequently identification of a single ‘best’ set of parameter values is difficult. To
address this estimation problem we use a method called Bayesian melding (Raftery et al.,
1995; Poole and Raftery, 2000).
Bayesian melding searches the joint parameter space for sets of parameter values that
are most likely given the data and what we know beforehand about the typical values for
the parameters and the age-patterns of mortality that we are modeling. Instead of identifying just the one most likely set of parameter values, it finds the most likely region of the
parameter space and returns the sets of parameter values in that region. Each set of parameter values is associated with a probability corresponding to how well it reflects the data.
These probabilities are used to construct joint distributions of the parameter values that can
be used to draw inferences about both the parameters themselves and the age-patterns of
mortality that they represent. This method makes no assumptions about the structure of
the parameter space – e.g. that it is elliptical or ‘Normal’ in nature – and produces true
probability distributions of the parameter values and outputs. These distributions allow us
to make theoretically and empirically sound statements about uncertainty.

2.3

Conclusions

The evidence from Agincourt demonstrates the profound effects of HIV on mortality. With
a lag of several years after increases in HIV prevalence of 10-15%, the mortality of young
children and adults increased dramatically. The corresponding drops in the expectation of
life at birth removed about 15 years of life from the average person living in the Agincourt
area. All of these changes are highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. Although this is
not a new finding, we contribute an unusual nuance – the sex-specific age-pattern of increases
in mortality following increases in HIV prevalence.
The eight-parameter Heligman-Pollard model fits HIV-related mortality at Agincourt very
well. The parameters that should respond to HIV-related mortality do indeed reflect the
increases in mortality associated with HIV in a temporal sequence consistent with changes
in HIV prevalence. In particular the hump parameters capture the increases in HIV at adult
ages, and the hump they generate nicely reproduces the age profile of adult mortality affected
by HIV.
The Bayesian melding estimation procedure allows us to make robust fits of the eightparameter Heligman-Pollard model of age-specific mortality to period-sex-age-specific mortality rates covering four phases of the growing HIV epidemic in the Agincourt study population. This Bayesian technique also allows us to characterize uncertainty in both the
parameters and outputs of the model (the estimated mortality age schedule) without assuming any special properties for or relationships among the parameters, and the resulting
credible intervals can be used for inference.

Recommendations

1. Where the data exist to describe period-sex-age-specific mortality in Africa they should
be used to their full potential. Data of this type are comparatively rare in Africa, and
this re-emphasizes the need to better utilize the data that do exist and to improve
the empirical basis for the study of mortality and its causes in Africa through the
development of new affordable, representative methods to study vital events.
2. A limitation of the analysis presented here is that cause of death is not known for all of
the deaths in the study. Future work should prioritize affordable, logistically feasible
methods for ascertaining cause of death in settings like Agincourt. The verbal autopsy
(Snow et al., 1992; Chandramohan et al., 1994; Kahn et al., 2000; Baiden et al., 2007)
with automated assignment of cause is a good possible solution. Priority should be
given to existing (Byass et al., 2003, 2006; Murray et al., 2007; King and Lu, 2008;
Fantahun et al., 2006) and future efforts to perfect the automation of cause assignment
for verbal autopsies.
3. The eight-parameter Heligman-Pollard model of age-specific mortality should be used
more often to smooth, interpolate and extrapolate mortality age schedules in situations
where mortality is affected by HIV.
4. Demographers should continue to explore the adoption of Bayesian techniques for estimating, fitting and calibrating. Bayesian melding and similar methods do not require
the assumptions necessary for some of the alternatives and provide a means to produce theoretically sound probabilistic measures of uncertainty in both the inputs and
outputs of models, and they often work when other methods break down. The cost
of this is additional computation and possibly an increment in complexity, but as
demonstrated here, these costs are not prohibitive.

Detailed Findings

In this section we present detailed findings related to the adult mortality hump associated
with HIV. We address changes in parameters D (level of hump), F (age location of hump)
and E (width or spread of hump) in sequence. Figures 5 and 6 plot the period-sex-specific
hump component (see Section 4.1) of the Heligman-Pollard mortality model in isolation
without the other components of the mortality schedule. Figure 5 plots the hump for each
sex by period and clearly reveals the growth in the hump from period to period. The upper
right panel of Figure 2 suggests that adult mortality increased at a similar pace for both
men and women until the final period when male mortality begins to intensify more quickly.
For females the largest increase occurs between the second and third periods. Figure 6
displays the hump curves with the male and female humps in a single plot for each period,
so that the sexes can be compared easily. This figure confirms that the hump is typically
slightly ‘older’ for males; the male humps usually peak at slightly older ages regardless of

12

the height or spread of the hump. This is especially pronounced during the first period when
the mortality effects of HIV are first being observed.

Figure 5: Hump Component for All Periods and Both Sexes.
Increasing values of the age location parameter, F, plotted in the lower right panel of Figure 2 suggest an aging mortality hump for both sexes. Recall that women tend to be infected
with HIV at younger ages compared to men and consequently experience elevated mortality
at younger ages. The location parameter accurately reflects this previously observed pattern
with the male median estimate of F consistently outpacing the female estimate. Women
experience increasing mortality from the early to the late 30s (reflecting a female incidence
profile that starts infecting a significant number of women in their early 20s) while for men
the hump grows from the late 30s to the mid 40s . The unusually large value of the location
parameter in the first period for men probably results from a small increase in mortality
around the late 40s to early 50s. Because this is the first period, it is unlikely that this
small hump is a result of HIV-related deaths. Rather, HIV probably begins to affect the
male mortality schedule between the first and second periods, at which time the location
and level parameters begin to pick up increasing male mortality in the late 30s, consistent
with previously observed HIV mortality patterns. Change in the hump for men are seen best
in figure 5; clearly between the first and second periods the male hump increases slightly in
intensity and shifts back to the expected age range.

slight broadening of the mortality hump for both sexes, although the width of the hump
is about the same for boths sexes for periods 2-4. The exceptionally high value of the
width parameter for women in first period is picking up a slight but concentrated increase
in mortality in the late 20s to early 30s, possibly reflecting the earliest and youngest HIV
incidence for women. Although the credible intervals overlap for all periods after the initial
period, both sexes experience a slight broadening of the hump as time progresses. Figure
6 demonstrates the effects of decreasing values for parameter E, i.e. slight widening of the
hump. Comparing humps from the last two periods with those from the first two, two things
are clear: 1) the hump becomes taller reflecting the increases in the level parameter, D, and
2) the humps broaden as the width parameter, E, decreases. The widening of the humps
is asymmetric with the bulk of the changes happening at older ages (35+) where the hump
appears to flatten out. These changes reflect the spreading of increased adult mortality into
the older middle adult ages, 35-45, likely reflecting a widening of the age profile of incidence
resulting in deaths associated with HIV at increasingly older ages.

Methods & Data

4.1

The Heligman-Pollard Mortality Model

We use the Heligman-Pollard mortality model (Heligman and Pollard, 1980) to assess mortality at all ages over a 14-year period, below in equation 1. This model expresses the
probability of dying as a function of age using a three-part expression that covers the entire
age range1 x > 0

(1)

where x is age and A - H (see Table 2 above) are eight variable parameters that govern the
shape of the mortality curve.
Compared to non-parametric alternatives, the advantages of parametric models like this
are: 1) the ability to produce smooth curves, 2) the ability to interpolate, 3) the possibility
of formal manipulation, 4) parsimony, 5) interpretable parameters whose values can be compared easily and 6) the ability to easily capture and reflect trends and mediate comparisons
(Dellaportas, 2001; Deb´on et al., 2005). These last two advantages, along with the ability of
parametric models to succinctly summarize large amounts of data, are especially useful to
us. The representation of mortality trends via parametric methods facilitates a time-series
approach whereby the shape and intensity of age-specific mortality curves can be summarized and compared over time (Deb´on et al., 2005; Congdon, 1993; Rogers and Gard, 1991;
Hartmann, 1987).
The Heligman-Pollard model has been used to document changes in mortality in a va1

For age 0 one can use a very small number like 0.00001 (the approach we use in this paper) or the
formula described in Rogers and Gard (1991), pg. 80.

riety of contexts, see for example Heligman and Pollard (1980); Dellaportas (2001); Deb´on
et al. (2005); Congdon (1993); Forfar and Smith (1987); Hartmann (1987); Rogers (1986);
Dellaportas (2001). In their original paper Heligman and Pollard (1980) describe Australian
mortality over the 20th century, and Rogers and Gard (1991) document declining infant and
young adult mortality over the 20th century in the U.S. There are few examples of this type
of use for the Heligman-Pollard mortality model in the developing world, and we cannot
find a previous published example of the Heligman-Pollard mortality model being used to
characterize mortality schedules affected by HIV over time.
Although originally conceived to capture the slight rise in mortality from accidents occurring in the late teens and early adult years, the so-called ‘accident’ hump contained in
the Heligman-Pollard mortality model is flexible enough to represent the much larger bulges
in adult mortality brought about by AIDS deaths. The ability of the Heligman-Pollard to
reflect levels of mortality at all ages and in particular to characterize the level and shape of
adult mortality make it well suited to assess the increasing intensity of adult mortality over
the 1990s and 2000s in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, because the model parameters have
straightforward demographic interpretations (i.e. describing not only the level but also the
shape and location of adult mortality) we can easily link the parameter changes to lagged
HIV prevalence to begin understanding of specific effects of HIV on mortality.
The eight parameters of the Heligman-Pollard model control three separate additive components corresponding to three age ranges of the mortality schedule (child mortality, young
adult mortality and late life mortality), and each parameter has a demographic interpre-

16

tation (Heligman and Pollard, 1980; McNown and Rogers, 1989; Rogers and Gard, 1991).
Figure 7 displays each of the components and the sum of all three, i.e. the final curve2 . Table 2 provides interpretations for the parameters, and the eight panels of Figure 8 illustrate
the effect of each of the parameters individually. Each panel plots the modeled mortality
schedule with variation in a single parameter while holding the others constant.
The first three A, B & C control the first component and describe early child mortality.
A roughly approximates mortality at age one and can be taken as a measure of the intensity
or level of child mortality (McNown and Rogers, 1989; Rogers and Gard, 1991; Hartmann,
1987). B is the age displacement variable (Rogers and Gard, 1991) and reflects the difference
between mortality at ages 1 and 0. As the value of B increases, 1 q0 decreases below 0.5 and
begins to approach 1 q1 (Rogers and Gard, 1991). Finally, C indicates how quickly mortality
decreases during childhood and into the young adult years. Parameters A, B & C all have
domain (0, 1). Declines in A are consistent with decreasing child mortality (Hartmann,
1987). Because the potential direct impact of pediatric AIDS deaths and the indirect impact
of adult AIDS mortality on child mortality, we expect the level of child mortality to increase
from period to period leading to increases in A for both sexes as time goes on and the HIV
epidemic grows.
The second component of the model is designed to reproduce the ‘accident’ hump in many
male mortality schedules, and possibly maternal mortality in female mortality schedules
(Heligman and Pollard, 1980; Hartmann, 1987; McNown and Rogers, 1989; Rogers and Gard,
1991). When it reflects accidents, the hump peaks in the (early) twenties. We reinterpret
the hump to reflect AIDS mortality at young and slightly older adult ages, so in our use the
peak is older and taller. Parameter D controls the level or intensity of young adult mortality,
E is inversely related to the spread of the hump and F locates its position along the age
axis (Heligman and Pollard, 1980; McNown and Rogers, 1989; Rogers and Gard, 1991).
Parameters D and E have domains (0, 1) and (0, ∞) respectively while the domain of F is
less clear. We restrict F to the domain (15, 55) because we do not expect a large number
of AIDS deaths at ages older than 55. With the hump reflecting AIDS mortality, we expect
increasing levels of adult mortality for both sexes as time progresses, i.e. increases in D. As
the epidemic matures we also expect a broadening and aging of the adult mortality hump,
i.e. decreases in E and increases in F . Note that if D is sufficiently small the other two
parameters controlling this component of the curve have no influence. Inspecting Equation
1 and the panel for parameter D in Figure 8, one can see that the second component of the
model is composed of the product of D and the effects of E and F , so a small D essentially
negates the effect of the spread and location parameters.
The last two parameters control the late life mortality section of the curve and describe the
steep increase in mortality at those ages. Parameter G measures the base level of mortality
at these ages (x = 0) and H defines the rate of increase (Rogers and Gard, 1991). Parameters
G and H are the intercept and slope of the Gompertz curve respectively and take domains
(0, 1) and (0, ∞) respectively.

Data

We use data describing mortality and HIV prevalence. Mortality data come from the Agincourt health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) site in South Africa (Kahn et al.,
2007). The site is located in a rural area of Mpumalanga Province in the northeast of South
Africa where HIV prevalence is a little less than 30% (Department of Health, Republic of
South Africa, 2006). Using time-sex-age-specific counts of deaths and person years for the
period 1994-2007, we compute time-sex-age-specific probabilities of dying n qx using standard
life table methods. Our estimation procedure requires the denominator (lx ) in the probability of dying to have approximately the same scale as the empirical data. This requires us
to rescale the lx column of the life table, and we do this using MS Excel’s ‘solver’ utility to
find a value for l0 that yields the same total number of person years T0 in the life table as
there are in the observed data.
Because the annual data contain few deaths and are consequently ‘noisy,’ we aggregate
across time. Periods are chosen to contain years with similar mortality rates. The four
periods we use are: 1994-1997 (l0male = 1, 917, l0f emale = 1, 873), 1998-2001 (l0male = 2, 100,
l0f emale = 2, 049), 2002-2004 (l0male = 1, 896, l0f emale = 1, 822) and 2005-2007 (l0male = 1, 974,
l0f emale = 1, 893). Figure 9 displays the aggregated and rescaled mortality schedules for males
and females. Appendix A lists the data as used in our analysis.
Data describing the trend in HIV prevalence in Mpumalanga Province are taken from
reports published by the South African Department of Health (1995; 1996; 1997; 1998; 2003;
2006). For the most part these estimates are made using anonymous HIV test results from
pregnant women who attend antenatal clinics.

Bayesian Melding Estimation

We now turn to the Bayesian method used for parameter estimation3 . In the Bayesian
framework parameters are treated as random variables. Prior beliefs about the parameters
are quantified in the form of a joint probability density p(θ), where θ is a vector of parameters
for which we will make inference. The data y are brought in by specifying a likelihood L(y|θ)
which is the probability of the observed data for a given value of the parameter vector. Using
Bayes’ Theorem and the marginal density of the data p(y), we can update our prior beliefs
to obtain the posterior distribution4
L(y|θ)p(θ)
p(y)
∝ L(y|θ)p(θ),

p(θ|y) =

(2)

which is used to make inference for θ.
Bayesian melding (Poole and Raftery, 2000) is designed for problems in which a deterministic model – such as the Heligman-Pollard mortality model – is used in the likelihood
function. Let M represent the model which transforms a set of parameter inputs θ into a set
of model outputs φ = M (θ). As described above, the Bayesian approach requires a prior density for the model inputs p(θ) and a likelihood for the outputs and the data L(M (θ)). These
two sources of information are combined to produce the following posterior distribution for
the model inputs
p(θ|y) ∝ L(y|M (θ))p(θ).
Inference is performed by sampling from p(θ|y) and summarizing the resulting posterior
sample. We can run the model for each set of inputs in the posterior sample to obtain a
posterior sample of the model outputs p(φ|y). Note that the posterior sample reflects the
distribution of model outputs, and thus the quantiles of the posterior sample can be used to
make probabilistic statements about the values of the model outputs.
In our analysis of the Heligman-Pollald mortality model, we specify independent uniform
priors that are intended to be fairly uninformative, placing most of the influence with the
observed data. We use the binomial likelihood which is a natural choice given that the
observed n qx are probabilities. The likelihoods for each age are treated as independent and
combined to produce a total likelihood. The prior distributions are
A ∼ U [0, 0.25]
B ∼ U [0, 1]
C ∼ U [0, 1]

D ∼ U [0, 0.25]
E ∼ U [0, 20]
F ∼ U [15, 55] .

3

G ∼ U [0, 0.01]
H ∼ U [1, 1.5]

The following discussion of Bayesian melding adapted from (Clark et al., 2010)
Equation 2 arises from the fact that p(y) does not depend on θ, so the posterior distribution only needs
to be known up to a constant and is thus proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior.
4

20

Our data are counts of deaths and persons at risk of dying in each time-sex-age cell. This
leads to the use of the binomial distribution in the likelihood specification. The likelihood
is the probability of witnessing the observed age distribution of deaths given the age-specific
probabilities of dying produced by the Heligman-Pollard model with a given set of parameter
values. The likelihood is

where y = (d, l) are the data consisting of counts of deaths and persons at risk of dying by
age and M (θ) = q are the age-specific probabilities of dying output by the Heligman-Pollard
model with a given set of values for the parameter vector θ. For a given age group i, li is
the number of people at risk of dying from the data and di is the number of deaths from
the data. qi is the probability of dying in age group i from the model with a specific set of
parameter values.
Bayesian melding has been used to analyze other deterministic models (e.g. Alkema et al.,
ˇ c´ıkov´a et al., 2007) using the Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) algorithm
2007; Sevˇ
(Rubin, 1987; Poole and Raftery, 2000) to sample from the posterior distribution. Instead we
use incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS) to obtain samples from the posterior
distribution. Incremental mixture importance sampling was originally introduced by Steele
et al. (2003, 2006) and was later developed for posterior distributions of continuous parameters, in particular for deterministic demographic-epidemiological models, by Raftery and
Bao (2010). The SIR algorithm draws a large number of samples from the prior distribution
of the model parameters, weights each sample by its likelihood and then resamples with replacement using the computed weights (Rubin, 1988). Sometimes SIR performs poorly and
few distinct values are present in the final sample because a small number of large importance weights dominate the resampling step. The IMIS algorithm addresses this problem.
After calculating the likelihoods and weights as in the SIR algorithm, at each iteration a
multivariate normal distribution centered at the parameter vector value with the highest
importance weight is added to the current importance sampling distribution, thus forming
a mixture and successfully representing parts of the parameter space that might otherwise
be missed. If the initial sample from the prior misses a high probability region, IMIS may
also fail to cover that region. To address this problem Raftery and Bao (2010) suggest inserting an optimization step after the initial stage (i.e. drawing the samples from the prior
distribution and calculating their weights) to yield a mixture of d multivariate normal distributions centered around a local maximum of the target distributions. New inputs drawn
from the multivariate normal distributions from the optimization step are combined with the
initial inputs and new likelihoods and weights are calculated. In the final resampling stage,
IMIS resamples x number of inputs with replacement from the mixture distribution with
the calculated weights, and it is this final sample that approximates the posterior parameter
distribution. Compared to SIR, IMIS is much more efficient. See Raftery and Bao (2010)
for further details of IMIS.
In our application the Bayesian melding approach has important advantages compared
21

to common alternative estimation procedures. The Heligman-Pollard model is usually fit
using least squares methods, but over-parameterization (the situation in which a range of
parameter values produces very similar fits) is a problem for this technique (Bebbington
et al., 2007; Dellaportas, 2001; Congdon, 1993). Dellaportas (2001) use a different Bayesian
approach and report that the over-parameterization issue is usually resolved by using informative priors (Congdon, 1993). One way to assess the over-parameterization problem is
to examine the correlation between parameters. We present pairs plots for each sex/year
combination in Appendix C. The parameters are essentially uncorrelated except G and H,
and the correlation of G and H is expected since they act together as a product. Another
difficulty in estimating the Heligman-Pollard model occurs when the hump is flat. In this
case the hump parameters can take values beyond a plausible range (Rogers and Gard, 1991;
Hartmann, 1987; Heligman and Pollard, 1980). In this circumstance the level parameter D
may be large and the location parameter F on order 100, essentially creating a very broad,
flat hump whose upswing merges into the natural rise in mortality at older ages. Fixing
one or more parameters and estimating the others tends to resolve this problem (Congdon,
1993; Rogers and Gard, 1991; Hartmann, 1987). Instead we let all the parameters vary simultaneously while restricting the range on parameter F to between 15 and 55, which keeps
the hump parameters in plausible ranges and prevents the hump from merging into old-age
mortality.
In this analysis we sample 400 sets of parameter values in the final resample (the result is
a 400 × 8 matrix with each row corresponding to one draw of the final resample) which can
then be used to calculate 400 separate n qx schedules, each covering the whole age range. The
result is an approximation of the posterior distribution of n qx values, i.e. a distribution of
the probabilities of dying, not the number of deaths, which is what we used in the likelihood
and therefore what want. To produce a predicted distribution of the number of deaths that
we can compare to the data, we simulate death counts from the posterior distribution of n qx
values. This is accomplished using the binomial distribution with the observed number of
people at risk of dying and an n qx value sampled at random from the posterior distribution
of n qx . The number of deaths is then divided by the number of people at risk of dying to
produce a predicted n qx value. This procedure is repeated many times to yield a distribution
of predicted n qx values. Figure 10 plots the n qx values simulated from the posterior output
distribution for the first (flat hump) and the last (more intense and concentrated hump)
periods for males. The gray clouds are the simulated n qx values. For those who are interested,
Appendix D presents the prior and posterior densities for each parameter by sex and year.

Relationship between Parameters and HIV Prevalence over
Time

To investigate the temporal relationship between trends in the values of the Heligman-Pollard
parameters and HIV prevalence, for each sex we plot the median value of the parameter
distributions for parameters A, D, E and F by the mean HIV prevalence in Mpumalanga
Province with a five-year lag, Figure 3 above. We expect increases in HIV prevalence to
be followed by increases in both child and adult mortality, so there should be a positive

Additionally we expect the spread and location parameters E and F to reveal changes in the
general age structure of adult mortality affected by HIV. Table 1 above presents the mean
HIV prevalence levels for the relevant five-year lagged periods.

Calculating Uncertainty around Life Table Columns

Very few life tables are presented with confidence intervals or other measures of uncertainty,
and consequently the ability to compare life tables and make statistically sound statements
about differences between them is impossible. Although work has been done in this area
(see for example: Chiang, 1984; Lynch and Brown, 2005) it seems to be largely ignored. An
advantage of our Bayesian approach is the ability to estimate uncertainty bounds around
both the model parameters and the outputs. We exploit this to generate uncertainty bounds
around the other columns of a standard life table, in particular around the ex schedules.
For each period and sex the predictive n qx distributions, shown in Appendix B, contain
400 individual n qx schedules from which we calculate a ‘distribution’ of 400 individual life
tables. We present the median ex distributions in Figures 4 and Appendix C and the median
e0 and e10 with measures of uncertainty summarized from their distributions in Tables 1 and
4. We use these to make statistically valid statements about changes in the expectation of
life.

Background & Significance

Our results contribute to a growing literature on the link between HIV prevalence and
mortality. We identify age-specific increases in all-cause mortality that follow increases in
HIV prevalence with a predictable lag. These results confirm our general understanding of
how HIV epidemics work and corroborate and add to the specific findings of other researchers,
briefly reviewed below.

5.1

Age-specific Effect of HIV on Mortality

The HI virus attacks a persons immune system, gradually wearing it down until it cannot
control infections, or even itself. The result is a long period of infection and gradually
worsening illness ending in death. Because of the long lag time between infection and death,
the effect of HIV on mortality is observed several years after infection. In the absence of
antiretroviral treatment, the time between infection and death for children is between five
and ten years (Marston et al., 2005) and for adults about ten years (Jaffar et al., 2004;
Morgan et al., 2002). The age-pattern of the effect of HIV on mortality is determined by the
age-pattern of transmission and whether or not there is widespread use of antiretroviral drug
therapy (Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy, HAART) in the population. The common
modes of transmission in high prevalence populations are heterosexual sexual intercourse and
mother-to-child transmission at birth or during breastfeeding. Consequently infections occur
at or shortly after birth and at ages when people are most sexually active. Those ages vary
from population to population but generally span the late teens through older adulthood,
with peaks sometime in the twenties or thirties. Layered on top of this is individual variation
in sexual activity that effectively protects a fraction of the population and creates a gradient
of risk in the remaining fraction. The net result in a mature HIV epidemic in a population
without widespread treatment is that the bulk of the at-risk portion of the population is
infected soon after becoming sexually active, and as a consequence the effect of HIV on
mortality is relatively concentrated at the youngest possible ages, about ten years after the
average age at infection. Finally, because women typically pair with slightly older men, the
average age at infection for women is usually several years younger than men, and hence the
mortality effect of HIV is slightly younger for women compared to men. In general this leads
to an age-profile of HIV-related mortality that affects infants and young children, women
roughly aged 25-50, and men roughly aged 30-60. Although there is a lot of variation in
this general pattern, depending on the specifics of HIV transmission and whether or not
HAART is available, this general sex-age-pattern of HIV mortality is commonly observed in
˙
populations with high prevalence (Porter and Zaba,
2004).

5.2

HIV & Mortality in sub-Saharan Africa

In sub-Saharan Africa the HIV epidemic affects all parts of the population stretching beyond high-risk groups and into the most rural communities (Poit et al., 2001). Rising HIV
prevalence over the past 15 to 20 years has lead to increases in child and adult mortality
24

and dramatic decreases in life expectancy (Tollman et al., 1999; Hosegood et al., 2004). Our
understanding of the role of HIV in shaping mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is supported by
information from a wide variety of data, including both direct and indirect estimates of mortality. Indirect evidence on adult mortality from national and regional statistics, including
censuses and sample surveys, provide an understanding of trends in mortality at national or
regional levels (Blacker, 2004), while community-based and cohort studies offer more direct
evidence on the role of HIV/AIDS by comparing the mortality experience of infected and
˙
non-infected individuals (Zaba
et al., 2004, 2007).
Most of Africa does not have a functioning vital registration system that covers enough
of the population to produce indicators that are either representative or accurate5 . Instead,
population censuses and sample surveys have become the main source of representative
information on demographic trends. These data reveal consistent large increases in adult
mortality, 45 q15 , since the early 1990s for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Blacker,
2004). Based on an analysis of sibling histories in Demographic and Health Surveys, Timæus
and Jasseh (2004) report that by the year 2000 an average 15 year old person living in subSaharan Africa faced a probability of dying before age 60 of between 0.3 and 0.6, up from
0.1 to 0.3 during the 1980s.
An important limitation of these data is that they do not describe the causes of death.
Nonetheless, they still provide strong evidence that HIV is largely responsible for the recent
upswing in mortality rates. The sibling history study reported by Timæus and Jasseh (2004)
reveal a sharp increase in adult mortality after countries develop a generalized (at least 1% of
the population infected6 ) epidemic. Likewise, United Nations (2004) report that in countries
where adult mortality was either declining or stabilizing, HIV prevalence was 5% or lower,
while countries with increasing mortality had prevalence between 7 and 33%. National-level
data also suggest a strong effect of HIV on age-specific mortality. Blacker (2004) notes that
an examination of the age pattern of mortality increases is useful in assessing the impact
of HIV on adult mortality; specifically rapidly rising adult mortality that peaks at younger
ages for women compared to men. Timæus and Jasseh (2004) note that the excess mortality
they observe in the DHS data is concentrated at ages 25-39 for women and 30-44 for men.
Complementing the ability of census and survey data to describe macro-level trends in
mortality, community-based studies that collect data on the HIV serostatus of participants
can compare the mortality of infected and uninfected individuals. The age profile of the
effect of HIV on mortality is determined by the stage of the epidemic, the age profile of
incidence in the past and the average time between infection and death. Because community
studies have the ability to track the survival times of infected individuals, they are one of
the only sources of data able to provide average times between infection and death. Studies
5

Data on mortality in developing regions can often be of meager quality due to poor vital registration
˙
systems (Porter and Zaba,
2004). In addition, people with HIV/AIDS often die of some other more immediate
cause, which is then recorded as the primary cause of death resulting in some underreporting of HIV/AIDSrelated mortality. These issues extend to South Africa as well (Botha and Bradshaw, 1985; Tollman et al.,
1999).
6
A stationary population with an expectation of life of ten years, similar to the HIV-positive population,
has a crude death rate of 1/10 = 0.1 or 100 per 1,000. A population containing 1% HIV-positive people will
therefore add about 1 additional death per 1,000 to the crude death rate.

25

like this that have prospectively monitored cohorts of HIV positive people estimate survival
times in the range 9-11 years for individuals infected in their 20s and shorter survival times
˙
for people infected at older ages (Porter and Zaba,
2004; Todd et al., 2007). Direct evidence
from community-based studies provides the best understanding of the effect of HIV on the
˙
level and age-pattern of adult mortality (see for example: Porter and Zaba,
2004; Groenewald
˙
et al., 2005; Adjuik et al., 2006; Nyirenda et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2007; Zaba
et al., 2007;
Marston et al., 2007). Data from health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) field
sites in Africa and Asia – all prospective community-level sites – identify seven age patterns
of mortality, two of which likely reflect a substantial effect of HIV. Those two patterns have
significant humps in the age-pattern of mortality between ages 20 to 55 for males and 20 to
45 for females (Clark, 2002).
South Africa is experiencing one of the most rapidly progressing HIV epidemics in the
world (Hosegood et al., 2004; Karim and Karim, 1999; Department of Health, Republic of
South Africa, 2003). While there was virtually no HIV mortality at the beginning of the
1990s, by 2000 Dorrington et al. (2001) identify significant HIV-related mortality. Hosegood
et al. (2004) report that AIDS was the most important single cause of death driving the
steep increase mortality rates in South Africa. As in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, HIV
prevalence among South African women is younger than among men, and the risk of dying
from AIDS peaks at younger ages for women (25-39) compared to men (30-44) (Tollman
et al., 1999; Hosegood et al., 2004; Groenewald et al., 2005).
HIV is also affecting child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, and again there are few data
to describe this effect. The data that do exist come largely from small hospital-based studies
˙
and population-based projects that estimate HIV-related child mortality rates (Zaba
et al.,
2004) using a variety of methods. Although the effect of HIV on under-five mortality varies
broadly by region, the impact appears to be substantial in southern Africa where the worst
affected countries are; in these populations HIV may be causing up to half of all child deaths
(Newell et al., 2004). Some 90% of pediatric HIV infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa
and because many HIV-infected children die before their fifth birthday, childhood mortality
overall can be greatly elevated by HIV (Dabis and Ekpini, 2002; Foster and Williamson,
2000; De Cock et al., 2000). Given the high rates of transmission from mother to child, we
expect that increases in HIV prevalence of adult women will increase child mortality. HIV
may also indirectly affect child mortality through maternal HIV status because children of
HIV infected mothers are more likely to die than those of uninfected mothers (Newell et al.,
˙
2004; Zaba
et al., 2004).

Discussion
Summary

In this article we use the parametric Heligman-Pollard mortality model to characterize what
we believe is the age-specific impact of HIV on mortality in the Agincourt study population
living in rural northeast South Africa over the period 1994-2007. The eight parameters of
26

the Heligman-Pollard model describe the shape of the age-specific n qx schedule in three age
ranges. We estimate the model using the Bayesian melding method with IMIS to produce
robust estimates of the parameter values, the n qx schedules output by the model and the
corresponding life tables in four periods during which the HIV epidemic in this population
grew rapidly. The Bayesian framework yields probabilistic measures of uncertainty around all
of these estimates, and we use these to compare both parameter estimates and n qx values over
time and between the sexes. There are dramatic increases in mortality of young children and
young to middle-aged adults that closely follow increases in HIV prevalence with a roughly
five-year lag. This leads to losses of life expectancy of about 14 years for both men and
women.
The parameterization of the Heligman-Pollard model allows us to summarize the complex
age-specific increases in mortality with a small number of estimated parameter values. The
increases in young child mortality are captured with parameter A, and the appearance and
growth of the hump in adult mortality are reflected by changes in the ‘hump parameters’
– D, E and F . The hump level parameter progressively increases, and the hump spread
parameter decreases, corresponding to a gradual widening of the hump. Sex differences in
these dynamics suggest that the epidemic started and stays slightly older for men, and for
women the epidemic started in a very narrow, young age range and gradually expanded to
include older ages. The estimated parameters succeed as a parsimonious and informative
description of the age-specific changes in mortality as the HIV epidemic grew.
The Bayesian melding with IMIS estimation procedure results in a joint posterior distribution of the parameters. Running this posterior through the model yields a posterior
distribution of n qx schedules from which counts of deaths can be simulated and transformed
into predicted n qx schedules, from which predicted life tables can be constructed. This results in a distribution of life tables, or equivalently, a predictive distribution for each column
in the life table from which we calculate measures of uncertainty. The resulting estimates
and credible intervals allow us to make strong probability-based statements about differences
between mortality schedules and components of mortality schedules.

6.2

Ideas for Future Work

Missing from our current analysis is cause of death. Data to examine cause of death over the
full period of the current analysis (’94-’07) are currently not available, but should be soon.
We will use those data to investigate the cause profiles that drive the age-specific changes in
mortality that we have identified here. We expect AIDS and HIV-related causes to dominate,
and we will attempt to relate changes in those causes to changes in the parameters of the
Heligman-Pollard model that reflect those changes, possibly even identifying a signature set
of changes in Heligman-Pollard parameters that is strongly related to increases in HIV-related
deaths.
We also hope to adapt the Bayesian melding with IMIS approach to a parametric model
of fertility and use that to investigate recent changes in fertility in a fashion similar to
our investigation of mortality, and possibly a joint investigation of simultaneous changes in

27

fertility and mortality.
Along similar lines, we will use an HIV-enabled cohort component projection model first
described by Heuveline (2003) and our adaptation of Bayesian melding with IMIS (Clark
et al., 2010) to develop a modeling framework that can be used to assess the effects of antiretroviral treatment programs on mortality, fertility, population growth, age structure, sex
ratios, etc. of the Agincourt study population. This will require adding the ability to represent treatment programs in the model, and based on the recently announced positive results
of microbicide and behavioral trials (McNeil Jr., 2010), we will consider ways of representing
those treatments as well, in particular because a similar behavior trial is currently underway
at the Agincourt field site.
Finally, we will shortly release an R package that implements all of the methods described
in this paper, and we will continue to develop and improve that package. The package will
be available as a standard R package that can be run using the R statistical software. The
user will supply age-specific counts of deaths and person years, and the package will estimate
the Heligman-Pollard model for those data and produce a variety of outputs similar to those
presented here.
