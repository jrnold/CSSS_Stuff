Abstract
Statistical methods have had a successful half-century in sociology, contributing to a greatly
improved standard of scientic rigor in the discipline. I identify three overlapping postwar
generations of statistical methods in sociology, based on the kinds of data they address. The
rst generation, which started in the late 1940s, deals with cross-tabulations, and focuses
on measures of association and loglinear models, perhaps the area of statistics to which
sociology has contributed the most. The second generation, which began in the 1960s, deals
with unit-level survey data, and focuses on LISREL-type causal models and event history
analysis. The third generation, starting to emerge in the late 1980s, deals with data that do
not fall easily into either of these categories, either because they have a dierent form, such
as texts or narratives, or because dependence is a crucial aspect, as with spatial or social
network data. There are many new challenges and the area is ripe for statistical research;
several major institutions have recently launched new initiatives in statistics and the social
sciences.

Introduction

To mark the year 2000, the Journal of the American Statistical Association published a
series of about fty short vignettes, each about some aspect of statistical development in
the century that was ending. The idea was to summarize some of the best work and to
highlight potentially fruitful areas of future research. I wrote the vignette about Statistics
in Sociology (Raftery 2000). Other vignettes of possible interest to Sociological Methodology
readers include the ones on contingency tables and loglinear models (Fienberg 2000), causal
inference in the social sciences (Sobel 2000), demography (Xie 2000), political methodology
(Beck 2000), psychometrics (Browne 2000), and empirical methods in legal science (Eisenberg
2000).
Many colleagues sent me comments on the rst draft, quite a few of them correctly
pointing out important developments that I had missed. It was impossible to rectify this
given the small amount of space allocated by JASA, but Sociological Methodology Editors
Michael Sobel and Mark Becker invited me to submit an expanded version that would provide
more appropriate coverage of this dynamic eld.
The roots of sociology go back to the mid 19th century and to seminal work by Auguste
Comte (who invented the word \sociology"), Karl Marx, Max Weber and Emile Durkheim on
the kind of society then newly emerging from the Industrial Revolution. Sociology has used
quantitative methods and data from the beginning. Comte, who launched the discipline,
was quite explicit about its grounding in statistical data. Durkheim's (1897) Le Suicide, for
example, made extensive use of statistical data.
However, prior to World War II, the data tended to be fragmentary, often bordering
on the anecdotal, and the statistical methods simple and descriptive. Camic and Wilson
(1994) identied Franklin H. Giddings as the father of quantitative sociology in America.
Giddings, who was appointed Professor of Sociology at Columbia in 1894 and died in 1931,
dened sociology as a eld that studies social phenomena at the aggregate level. He held that
statistical analysis in sociology consists largely of counting the individuals in each of several
categories and nding average characteristics of each category. From a modern statistical
perspective, a striking feature of his work was his relative lack of concern with variation.
Since then, the data available have grown in complexity, and statistical methods have
been developed to deal with them. Much of this statistical development has been due to
sociologists rather than statisticians; Clogg (1992) and the discussants of his article made this
point emphatically, and documented it well. This partly reects the fact that the number of
1

statisticians working on sociological problems has always been relatively small. Statisticians
have tended to work in greater numbers on problems emerging from medicine, engineering
and the biological sciences; this probably reects the balance of available funding in the latter
half of the twentieth century. There are some signs recently that this situation is changing,
which I will mention at the end of the article.
The overall trend in sociology in the past fty years has been towards more rigorous
formulation of hypotheses, larger and more detailed data sets, statistical models growing
in complexity to match the data, and a higher level of statistical analysis in the major
sociological journals. Statistical methods have had a successful half-century in sociology,
contributing to a greatly improved standard of scientic rigor in the discipline.
Sociology has made extensive use of a wide variety of statistical methods and models. I
will focus here on the ones developed by sociologists, those whose development was directly
motivated by sociological problems, and those that were rst published in sociological journals. Many other methods, such as those for limited dependent variables (logistic regression
springs to mind), have been used extensively in sociology, but they were primarily developed
in other disciplines in response to other problems. Important though they are for sociology,
I will mention these areas more briey.
A major omission from this article is any in-depth discussion of statistical methods that
have come to sociology from econometrics rather than from statistics; this would merit a
separate review article in its own right. Econometrics has been very inuential in sociological
methodology, some would argue as much or more as statistics itself, but here I do not review
this important inuence except incidentally.
At the risk of controversy, I will classify statistical methods in sociology by the kind of
data that they address, rather than by the method itself. I will distinguish three postwar
generations of statistical methods in sociology, each dened by the kind of data to which they
are most often applied: cross-tabulations, unit-level survey data, and newer data forms. Like
real generations, these intellectual generations overlap and the boundaries between them are
not clearcut; they all remain active today, albeit at dierent levels of maturity, and even
their starting points are not uniquely dened.
In the period starting after World War II, much of the data that sociologists had to
work with came in the form of cross-tabulations of counts from surveys and censuses. The
rst generation of methods I will discuss deals with data of this kind. Typically these
cross-classications involved only a small number of variables such as sex, age group and
occupational category; social mobility tables provided the canonical example for much of the
2

methodological work. This is perhaps the area of statistics to which sociologists have contributed the most; indeed, it could be argued that sociologists have dominated this subeld
and that the methods they have developed have been diusing out from sociology into other
disciplines. Schuessler (1980) is a survey that largely reects this rst-generation work.
By the early 1960s, sociologists no longer had to rely on cross-tabulations of counts,
and unit-level data from surveys that measured many variables were becoming available.
Computing power was also developing to the point where it could handle such data fairly
easily. The second generation of methods were developed to deal with data of this kind.
This generation of methods was galvanized by Blau and Duncan's (1967) highly inuential
book, The American Occupational Structure, and also by the establishment of Sociological
Methodology in 1969, and that of Sociological Methods and Research in 1972 as publication
outlets. Edgar Borgatta established both of these publications, the second when it became
rapidly apparent that there was both the supply and demand for more articles than could
be published by Sociological Methodology alone. These developments marked the coming of
age of research on quantitative methodology in sociology.
By the late 1980s, sociologists had conceived the ambition of analyzing data that do not
t easily into the standard straightjackets of crosstabulations or data matrices (although
they can sometimes be forced into it). These include texts or narratives, and data in which
dependence is a crucial aspect, such as social network data and data in which spatial referencing is a crucial aspect. They also include datasets that combine multiple types of data,
such as satellite images, enthnographic accounts, and quantitative measurements. The third
generation of methods is being developed to address data such as these. As bets its youth,
so far it is a lively and exciting grabbag of ideas and developments, not having yet achieved
the well-organized maturity of the rst two generations.
My classication of statistical methods in sociology into generations dened by the kind of
data addressed, rather than the kind of method used, does not reect the usual organization
of graduate training, and is bound to be somewhat controversial. Perhaps for reasons of
convenience and eÆciency in training, the major methods of sociology have tended to be
grouped together under categories such as regression models, limited dependent variable
models, loglinear models, structural equation models, event history analysis, and so on.
However, I have found it easier to attempt to discern past trends and to think about future
developments by focusing on the types of data that motivate the development of the methods
in the rst place.
We have come a long way in the past fty years. Today, much sociological research is
3

based on the reanalysis of large high-quality survey sample datasets, often collected with
public funds and publicly available to researchers, with typical sample sizes in the range
5,000{20,000, or greater. This has opened the way to easy replication of results and has
helped to produce standards of scientic rigor in sociology comparable to and greater than
those in many of the natural and medical sciences. Perhaps in part because of this, social statistics has recently started a rapid expansion as a research area, and several major
institutions have launched initiatives in this area in the past few years.

2.1

The First Generation: Cross-Tabulations
Categorical Data Analysis

Initially, much of the data that quantitative sociologists had to work with came in the form
of cross-classied tables, and so it is not surprising that this is perhaps the area of statistics
to which sociology has contributed the most. A canonical example has been the analysis of
social mobility tables, usually in the form of two-way tables of father's against respondent's
occupational category; typically the number of categories used is between ve and 17.
At rst the focus was on measures of association, or mobility indices as they were called
in the social mobility context (Glass 1954; Rogo 1953), but these indices failed to do the job
of separating structural mobility from exchange (or circulation) mobility. The solution to
this key problem in the analysis of mobility tables turned out to require explicit probability
models for the tables. Birch (1963) proposed the loglinear model for the observed counts
fxij g, given by
log(E [xij ]) = u + u1(i) + u2(j ) + u12(ij ) ;
(1)
where i indexes rows and j columns, u1(i) and u2(j ) are the main eects for the rows and
columns, and u12(ij ) is the interaction term, measuring departures from independence. This
provided the overall framework needed for the rigorous analysis of mobility and similar
tables. However, the diÆculty with model (1) in its original form for social mobility and
similar tables is that the number of parameters is too large for inference and interpretation.
For example in the U.S. data sets 17 categories were used, so the interaction term involves
162 = 256 parameters.
To make progress, it was necessary to model the interaction term parsimoniously (i.e.
with few parameters), but in a way that ts the data. A successful general approach to

4

doing this is the association model of Duncan (1979) and Goodman (1979):

u12(ij ) =

X 
M

m=1

m

j + i Æ (i; j );

(m) (m)

i

(2)

where Æ (i; j ) = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. In (2), i(m) is the score for the ith row on the kth
scoring dimension, and j(m) is the corresponding score for the j th column; these can be either
specied in advance or estimated from the data. The last term allows a dierent strength
of association on the diagonal. (The model (2) is unidentied as written; various identifying
constraints are possible.) This is often called the RC(M) model. In most applications to
date, M = 1; the rst genuine substantive application of the model in sociology with M > 1
was to labor market experiences and outcomes by Clogg, Eliason and Wahl (1990).
Goodman (1979) initially derived this model as a way of describing association in terms of
local odds ratios. Goodman (1985) has shown that this model is closely related to canonical
correlations and to correspondence analysis (Benzecri 1973), and provides an inferential
framework for these methodologies. When the categories are ordered, the uniform association
model with i = i = i is a useful starting point (Haberman 1979). In this model, the odds
ratios in all 2  2 subtables are equal, so this can be viewed as a discrete analogue to the
bivariate normal distribution, with   k specifying the correlation.
Table 1 shows the actual counts for a reduced version of the most extensive U.S. social
mobility study, and the tted values from an association model; the model accounts for 99.6%
of the association in the table and its success is evident. Hout (1984) extended the range
of application of these models by modeling the scores and diagonal terms in (2) as sums or
products of covariates, such as characteristics of the occupational categories in question; this
is an extension of Birch's (1965) linear-by-linear interaction model.
This methodology has also made it feasible to model relatively high-dimensional tables
with large numbers of categories in a parsimonious and interpretable way. This has led to
important discoveries, including Hout's (1988) nding that social mobility has been increasing in the U.S. This is a subtle result because of the complex nature of the data underlying
it, and it would have been hard to discover it without using the association model methodology. This substantive result was conrmed and rened in Ganzeboom, Luijkx and Treiman's
(1989) discovery, based on several hundred social mobility tables from dierent countries at
dierent time points, that social mobility has been increasing by about 1% a year in industrialized countries in the second half of the twentieth century.
Biblarz and Raftery (1993) and Biblarz, Raftery and Bucur (1997) adapted the models
to higher dimensional tables to study social mobility in nonintact families. The tables

they used had up to ve dimensions: father's occupation, ospring's occupation, gender,
race, and period, and up to about 7,000 cells. Thus standard loglinear models would not
have revealed anything, but association modeling, extending the models mentioned earlier,
did provide interpretable results, parameter estimates, and conclusions. They showed that
occupational resemblance is weaker in nonintact families than in intact ones, that ospring
raised by working single mothers succeed much better on average than those from other
nonintact families, and that these patterns have remained essentially constant from the
1960s through the 1990s, in spite of the many changes in family structure, occupational
distribution, and the relationship between gender, race and occupational and labor force
status. Other important applications of loglinear and related models include the analysis of
sex segregation (Charles and Grusky 1995), and assortative mating (Kalmijn 1991). From
sociology, the use of association models has diused to other disciplines, such as epidemiology
(Becker 1989).
One common reason for analyzing tables with more than two dimensions is to assess how
two-way associations vary across a third (or several other) dimension(s). Yamaguchi (1987)
and Xie (1992) have proposed specic forms of the higher-dimensional association model
that are adapted for this purpose, and these were unied and extended by Goodman and
Hout (1998). A particularly appealing aspect of the latter approach is the availability of a
range of graphical displays that facilitate the interpretation of the rather complex data and
model parameters that arise in this setting.
6

These models are for situations with discrete independent variables. Perhaps the most
successful models for the dependence of cross-classications on continuous independent variables are Sobel's (1981, 1985) diagonal mobility models. These have been applied in a variety
of settings, for example to marital fertility (Sorensen 1989), cultural consumption (De Graaf
1991), and voting behavior (Weakleim 1992).
An intuitive alternative formulation of the basic ideas underlying (1) and (2) is in terms
of marginal distributions rather than the main eects in (1). The resulting marginal models
specify a model for the marginal distributions and a model for the odds ratios, and this
implies a model for the joint distribution that is not loglinear (Lang and Agresti 1994;
Becker 1994; Becker and Yang 1998). The rst substantive application of these models in
sociology was to modeling social mobility (Sobel, Becker and Minick 1998).
2.2

Latent Class Models

An alternative approach that answers dierent questions is the latent class model (Lazarsfeld
1950; Lazarsfeld and Henry 1968; Goodman 1974a,b). In its basic form, this represents the
distribution of counts as a nite mixture of distributions within each of which the dierent
variables are independent. The model was introduced to account for observed associations
in multivariate discrete data, the original motivation being somewhat akin to that for factor
analysis for multivariate continuous data.
Hagenaars (1988, 1990) has extended the latent class model to the situation where each
component in the mixture can exhibit dependence. Clogg (1995) gives a survey of this area.
There have been many applications of this model. One interesting recent application to
criminology is by Roeder, Lynch and Nagin (1999).
This basic model has been formulated and used in other contexts. Chickering and Heckerman (1997) formulated it as a Bayesian graphical model with one hidden node. This
formulation facilitates estimation of latent class models with many variables, and also makes
it easier to estimate the model when there is missing data for some individuals, and to
make inference about the missing data. Celeux and Govaert (1991) used the same basic
model for clustering multivariate discrete observations, again potentially with large number
of variables.

2.3

Hypothesis Testing and Model Selection

Sociologists often have sample sizes in the thousands, and so they came up early and hard
against the problem that standard P -values can indicate rejection of null hypotheses in large
samples, even when the null model seems reasonable theoretically and inspection of the
data fails to reveal any striking discrepancies with it. The problem is compounded by the
fact that there are often many models rather than just the two envisaged by signicance
tests, and by the need to use stepwise or other multiple comparison methods for model
selection (e.g. Goodman 1971). By the early 1980s, some sociologists were dealing with this
problem by ignoring the results of P -value-based tests when they seemed counterintuitive
and by basing model selection instead on theoretical considerations and informal assessment
of discrepancies between model and data (e.g. Fienberg and Mason 1979; Hout 1983, 1984;
Grusky and Hauser 1984).
Then it was pointed out that this problem could be alleviated by basing model selection
instead on Bayes factors (Raftery 1986a), and that this can be simply approximated for
loglinear models by preferring a model if BIC, dened by BIC = Deviance (Degrees of
freedom) log(n), is smaller (Schwarz 1978; Raftery 1986b). For nested hypotheses, this
can be viewed as dening a signicance level for a test that decreases automatically with
sample size. Since then, this approach has been used in many sociological applications
of loglinear models. Kass and Wasserman (1995) showed that the approximation is quite
accurate if the Bayesian prior used for the model parameters is a unit information prior, i.e.
a prior distribution that contains about the same amount of information as a single \typical"
observation. Raftery (1995) indicated how the methodology can be extended to a range of
other models.
Weakliem (1999) criticized the use of BIC on the grounds that the unit information prior
to which it corresponds may be too diuse in practice, leading BIC to tend to favor the null
hypothesis too often. However, Raftery (1999) pointed out that the unit information prior
does provide a reasonable representation of the prior knowledge of an investigator who has
some advance information, but not a great deal, about the parameter values for the model she
is estimating. It can thus be viewed as approximating the situation where there is little prior
information. A more knowledgeable investigator would have a tighter prior distribution, and
thus might have a basis for rejecting a null hypothesis when BIC does not, but this would
be based on prior information rather than on data, and this should be made explicit in any
report that does so. BIC provides a conservative assessment of evidence: one can be quite
condent of the reality of any \eect," evidence of whose existence is favored strongly by
8

BIC. Weakliem's arguments can be viewed as implying that if real prior information is indeed
available it should be used, and I would agree with this. This points towards using Bayes
factors based on priors that reect the actual information available; this is easy to do for
loglinear and other generalized linear models (Raftery 1996).

The Second Generation: Unit-Level Survey Data

The second generation of statistical models responded to the availability of unit-level survey
data in the form of large data matrices of independent cases. The methods that have proved
successful for answering questions about such data have mostly been based on the linear
regression model and its extensions to path models, structural equation models, generalized
linear models and event history models. For questions about the distribution of variables
rather about than their predicted value, however, nonparametric methods have proven useful
(Morris, Bernhardt and Handcock 1994; Bernhardt, Morris and Handcock 1995; Handcock
and Morris 1998, 1999). We start by reviewing the development of the measurement of
occupational status, which provided a major impetus for the growth of the second generation
of methods.
3.1

Measuring Occupational Status

Occupational status is an important concept in sociology and developing a useful continuous
measure of it was a signal achievement of the eld. It was important for the development of
statistical methods in sociology because, starting in the early 1960s, it encouraged greater use
of regression analysis and related methods among scholars with an interest in the sources and
consequences of job-holding. These methodological approaches diused rapidly into other
areas of the discipline.
Initially, the status of an occupation was equated with its perceived prestige, as measured
in national surveys beginning in the 1940s. However, surveys could measure the prestige of
only a small number of the several hundred occupations identied in each decennial Census
classication. To ll in missing prestige scores for the 1960 Census classication, Duncan
(1961) regressed the prestige scores for the 45 occupations for which they were available on
measures of the proportion of occupational incumbents who had completed high school and
the proportion of incumbents who earned more than $10,000. He found that the predictions
were very good (R2 = 0:91) and that the two predictors were about equally weighted. Based
on this, he created a predicted prestige score for all occupations in the 1960 classication,

which became known as the Duncan Socioeconomic Index (SEI); the SEI later turned out
to be a better predictor of various social outcomes than the prestige scores themselves.
Duncan's initial work has been updated several times for subsequent Census classications
(Featherman and Stevens 1982; Nakao and Treas 1994; Hauser and Warren 1997), but has
recently been critiqued on conceptual and empirical grounds (Hauser and Warren 1997;
Warren, Sheridan, and Hauser 1998).
In much social research, particularly in economics, current income is used as a predictor of
social outcomes, but there are good reasons to prefer occupational status. It has proven to be
a good predictor of many social outcomes. Jobs and occupations can be measured accurately,
in contrast to income or wealth, whose measurement is plagued by problems of refusal, recall
and reliability. Also, occupational status is more stable over time than income, both within
careers and between generations. This suggests that occupational status may actually be a
better indicator of long-term or permanent income than (current) income itself. The status
of occupations tends to be fairly constant both in time and across countries (Treiman 1977).
3.2

The Many Uses of Structual Equation Models

Figure 1 shows the basic path model of occupational attainment at the heart of Blau and
Duncan (1967); see Duncan (1966). Wright (1921) introduced path analysis, and Blalock
(1961) gave it a causal interpretation in a social science context. One of the important uses
and motivations of structural equation models was to decompose a total eect into direct
and indirect eects. Alwin and Hauser ((1975) played an important role in showing how
to do this for sociological data. See Freedman (1987) and Sobel (1998) for critiques, and
Section 3.8 below for more discussion of causality in the social sciences.
Often, variables of interest in a causal model are not observed directly, but other variables
are observed that can be viewed as measurements of the variables, or \constructs" of interest,
such as prejudice, alienation, conservatism, self-esteem, discrimination, motivation or ability.
Joreskog (1973) dealt with this by maximum likelihood estimation of a structural equation
model with latent variables; this is sometimes called a LISREL model, from the name of
Joreskog's software. Duncan (1975) played a big role in introducing these ideas into sociology,
and Long (1984a,b) and Bollen (1989) provide well-written and accessible accounts geared
to sociologists. A typical model of this kind is shown in Figure 2; the goal of the analysis
is testing and estimating the strength of the relationship between the unobserved latent
variables represented by the thick arrow. Diagrams such as Figures 1 and 2 have proven
useful to sociologists for specifying theories and hypotheses and for building causal models.

The LISREL framework has been extended and used ingeniously for purposes beyond
those for which it was originally intended. Muthen (1983) extended it to categorical variables,
and Muthen (1997) showed how it can be used to represent longitudinal data, growth curve
models, and multilevel data. Kuo and Hauser (1996) used data on siblings to control for
unobserved family eects on socioeconomic outcomes, and cast the resulting random eects
model in a LISREL framework.
The advent of graphical Markov models (Spiegelhalter et al 1993), specied by conditional
independencies rather than by regression-like relationships, is important for the analysis of
multivariate dependencies, although they can seem less interpretable to sociologists. They
have been particularly useful for propagating information about some variables through a
system of dependent variables, to yield information about other, unobserved variables, as
is needed, for example, in the construction of expert systems for medical diagnosis and
other applications. They have been less used so far for inference and modeling in social
research, perhaps because sociological hypotheses tend to be formulated more often in terms
of regression or causal relationships than in terms of conditional independencies between
variables.
The relationship between graphical Markov models and structural equation models has
begun to be understood (Koster 1996, Spirtes et al 1998). Also, the LISREL model seems
ideally suited to Gibbs sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (Gilks
et al 1996), and this is likely to permit useful extensions of the framework (Raftery 1991;
Arminger 1998; Scheines, Hoijtink and Boomsma 1999).
3.3

Event History Analysis

Unit-level survey data often include or allow the reconstruction of life histories. These include
the times of crucial events such as marriages, divorces, births, commitals to and releases from
prison, job changes, or going on or o welfare.
Prior to 1972, two approaches were available for the analysis of the distribution of the
time to a single event such as death, and of the factors inuencing it. One was life table
analysis from demography, but this did not allow easy analysis of the factors inuencing
time to an event. The other was regression analysis of the observed times to the event, but
this was plagued by censoring, and by the often extreme nonnormality of the response.
This eld was revolutionized by the introduction of the Cox (1972) proportional hazards
model, which brought together these two approaches. Tuma (1976) and Tuma and Hannan
(1984) generalized this approach to allow for repeated events, for multiple types of events,
12

such as marriages and divorces, and for events consisting of movement between dierent
types of states, such as dierent job categories. Yamaguchi (1991) and Petersen (1991) have
provided accessible accounts of the methodology, emphasizing sociological applications, and
Mayer and Tuma (1990) described a collection of case studies from social science. One important area of application of hazard rate models has been organizational birth and death
processes; this is unique to sociology. Petersen (1995) extended the basic model further to
multiple types of events where the events are interdependent, i.e. where the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of one type of event aects the probability that the other type of event happens. An example is the relationship between becoming unemployed and getting divorced.
Xie (2000) has discussed the roots of event history analysis in demography and life table
analysis.
Uses of the Cox model in medecine have tended to treat the baseline hazard nonparametrically, but in social science it has sometimes been found useful to model it parametrically.
For example, Yamaguchi (1992) analyzed permanent employment in Japan where the surviving fraction (those who never change jobs) and its determinants are of key interest; he found
that covariates were associated both with the timing of job change and with the surviving
fraction. Yamaguchi and Ferguson (1995) provide another application of this idea, to the
stopping and spacing of child births.
Social science event history data are often recorded in discrete time, e.g. by year, either
because events tend to happen at particular times of year (e.g. graduating), or because of
measurement constraints. As a result, discrete-time event history models have been popular
(Allison 1982, 1984; Xie 1994), and in some ways are easier to handle than their continuoustime analogues. Ways of dealing with multilevel event history data, smoothly time-varying
covariates and other complications have been introduced in this context (e.g. Raftery, Lewis
and Aghajanian 1995; Fahrmeir and Knorr-Held 1997).
This basic framework has also been found useful to model a dierent kind of phenomenon:
that of diusion of innovations and social inuence. Burt (1987) provided a theoretical
framework for this work, and the extended event-history framework proposed for modeling
it was developed by Marsden and Podolny (1990), Strang (1991), and Strang and Tuma
(1993). A dierent approach, using accelerated failure-time models rather than proportional
hazards models, was developed by Diekmann (1989) and Yamaguchi (1994).
One problem with social science event history data is that dropping out can be related to
the event of interest. For example, people may tend to leave a study shortly before a divorce,
which will play havoc with estimation of divorce rates. The problem seems almost insoluble
13

at rst sight, but Hill (1997) produced an elegant solution using the Shared Unmeasured
Risk Factor (SURF) model of Hill, Axinn and Thornton (1993). The basic trick is to observe
that, although one does not know which of the people who dropped out actually got divorced
soon afterwards, one can estimate which ones were most at risk of divorcing. One can then
use this information to adjust the empirical divorce rates in the study by modeling divorce
and dropout simultaneously.
3.4

Binary Dependent Variables

The term \limited dependent variable" is usually used to refer to a scalar dependent variable
in a regression model, the set of whose possible values is restricted in a way that violates
the assumptions of normal linear regression too severely for it to be used. The canonical
example is binary dependent variables; others include nominal, ordinal and compositional
variables, and, in some contexts, variables that are constrained to be positive.
Limited dependent variables, especially binary variables, arise frequently in social research, and many articles in leading sociological journals use models and methods specically developed for this situation. Nevertheless, much of the methodological development in
this area has come from disciplines other than sociology. However, sociologists have played
a major role in expositing, adapting and synthesizing these methods; see, for example, the
books by Long (1997) and Xie and Powers (2000).
For binary responses, the method of choice in sociology in the past 20 years has been
logistic regression. Much of the early development was for medical applications (Corneld
1951, 1962; Truett et al 1967), and the monograph by Cox (1970) helped to introduce
the methods to a wide audience. The advent of generalized linear models (Nelder and
Wedderburn 1972), and the recognition that logistic regression is a special case, as well as
the development of the associated GLIM software (Baker and Nelder 1977), helped to make
logistic regression a standard tool in many disciplines, particularly in the social and health
sciences. Some version or descendant of the GLIM software is now included in most major
commercial statistical packages.
Logistic regression is not the only possible model for regression with binary responses.
Ordinary linear regression gives similar results if most of the probabilities are far enough
from 0 and 1 (say between 0.1 and 0.9). Logistic regression is more \correct" than linear
regression, since, for example, it constrains tted probabilities to lie between 0 and 1. Nevertheless, in the 1970s and 1980s there was a debate about whether logistic regression is really
needed, given that it is more complex to estimate and needs more computer time than linear
14

regression. The subsequent increase in computer speed made the additional computer time
negligible, and the debate was settled in favor of logistic regression.
Another alternative is probit regression, in which the dependent variable is assumed
to arise by truncating an unobserved normal random variable whose expectation depends
linearly on the independent variables. This is soundly based and easy to estimate, because
it is also a generalized linear model and so can be estimated using GLIM; it tends to give
results that are very similar to those from logistic regression. However, in sociology, as in
many other disciplines, it has lost out to logistic regression, perhaps because of the appealing
interpretation of the logistic regression coeÆcients as odds ratios. There has been a revival
of interest in probit regression recently among statisticians. This is because it is dened in
terms of latent variables, and so can be included relatively easily as a component in more
complex Bayesian models that are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (e.g. Albert
and Chib 1993).
A further alternative is complementary log-log regression, in which log( log(p)) is assumed to be a linear combination of independent variables, where p is the conditional probability of the event of interest, given the independent variables. This is also a generalized
linear model and so is easy to estimate. It can t much better than logistic regression, and
often gives quite dierent predicted probabilities, particularly for more extreme values of the
independent variables. One example of this is the Irish educational transition data discussed
by Raftery and Hout (1985); see Kass and Raftery (1995).
The introduction of two-sided logit models by Logan (1996, 1997) was an important development. This recognizes that in many situations in social life where individuals choose
between dierent outcomes, there are two types of force in play: the preferences and attributes of the individual, and those of the possible choices. For example, in the labor
market, which job an individual ends up in depends not only on his or her own attributes
and preferences or utilities, but also on those of the other candidates in the job market, and
those of the available employers and jobs. Logan's approach is to model both of these processes explicitly and simultaneously, and to explain the nal labor market outcomes in terms
of the interaction between them. The model can be estimated using either individual-level
data or data aggregated into a cross-classication.
3.5

Other Limited Dependent Variables

Logistic regression has been extended to nominal dependent variables with more than two
categories; see, for example, Hosmer and Lemeshow (1989). Maximum likelihood estima15

tion of the resulting multinomial logistic regression model is relatively straightforward, and
software to do it is available. Begg and Gray (1984) have shown that this can be very well
approximated by an appropriately set up (binary) logistic regression; see also Hosmer and
Lemeshow (1989). Logistic regression has also been extended to ordinal dependent variables;
see, for example, McCullagh and Nelder (1989) and Agresti (1990).
Another important kind of limited dependent variable arises when the variable is positive,
but has a nonnegligible probability of being exactly equal to zero. One example is income
from work: some people are out of the labor force or unemployed, and have zero income
from work, while all others have positive income. Data of this kind have often been analyzed
using the Tobit model of Tobin (1958). In this model, it is assumed that those with zero
income actually have an unobserved negative income, and the true income (now assumed
to be capable of taking all positive and negative values) is modeled using ordinary linear
regression.
The Tobit model in its original form seems rather unsatisfactory. For one thing, the
postulated unobserved value does not exist: those who have zero income actually do have
zero income (ignoring measurement error), not some unobserved negative income. Also, and
perhaps more seriously, the model assumes that the mechanism determining whether or not
someone has income from work, is essentially the same as the one that determines how much
they earn. It could easily be the case, however, that the mechanism that determines whether
or not someone is in the labor force is quite dierent from the mechanism that determines
how much they earn if they are in the labor force, and with the Tobit model it is hard to
make this distinction.
The Tobit model was developed before the widespread availability of specic methods
for binary dependent variables. Now, however, there is a simple alternative approach that
avoids the problems with the Tobit model. One simply models the data in two steps. In
the rst step, the dependent variable is whether or not the dependent variable is zero, and
this is modeled using probit regression. Then in the second step, the dependent variable
is the amount earned and only individuals with positive earnings are included. This is the
standard sample selection model, which led to the development of the Heckman (1979) twostage estimator. Amemiya (1985) calls this the Type II Tobit model. Winship and Mare
(1992) review subsequent developments in this areas.
A further kind of limited dependent variable arises in the analysis of compositional data.
Here the dependent variable is a vector of positive values that sum up to one, and consist
of proportions. An example is the analysis of household budgets: the response is a vec16

tor, each element of which is the proportion of total household expenditure spent on some
category, such as rent, food, utilities, education, and so on. One's rst idea might be to
model each proportion separately using regression, or perhaps to use a multivariate regression method that takes account of the correlation between the dierent responses. These
methods do not work, however, because of the constraint that the responses add up to one,
and so standard distributional assumptions do not apply. The observations lie on a simplex,
the high-dimensional analogue of the triangle, not on the full Euclidean space. A literature studying this situation has been summarized in part by Aitchison (1986); his main
recommendation is to rst transform the p-dimensional vector of proportions to a (p 1)dimensional vector on the full Euclidean space using the multivariate logistic transform, and
then to proceed using standard methods.
3.6

Multilevel Models

Multilevel models extend the regression models and their generalizations to situations where
individual-level outcomes depend, not just on individual-level covariates, but also on social
context. Much of the development in the social sciences has been in the context of education.
A canonical example is where the individual-level outcomes are grades or test scores, and
the contexts are the class, the school, the school district, the state, or some subset of these.
Often there is interest in the situation where the eect of an individual-level attribute,
such as household income, depends on the context. For example, it might be hypothesized
that in some schools the eects on test scores of inequalities due to dierences in household
income would be less than in other schools. The simplest approach to modeling such situations, with a view to estimating and testing the hypothesized eects, is via a xed eects
multilevel model. Suppose that yi is the outcome for student i who attends school s(i),
where there are S schools represented in the data, and that xi is his or her family income.
Then a simple xed eects model is

yi =  + s(i) xi + "i ;

(3)

where s(i) is the eect of household income on test score in student i's school, and "i iid

N (0; "2 ). There is a dierent regression coeÆcient j for each school j . This model can be
estimated by ordinary least squares regression; see, for example, Boyd and Iversen (1979)
and Blalock (1984).
There are several diÆculties with this model. One is that the number of parameters to be
estimated, equal to (S + 2), is large if there are many contexts (schools) involved, and so the
17

model is hard both to estimate accurately and to interpret. Another is that, if the number
of students from a particular school is small, and the estimated regression coeÆcient for
that school is extreme relative to the estimates for the other schools, the resulting estimate
is likely to be poor. This can be a problem, as it is often precisely these more extreme
estimates that are of most interest.
There has been a great deal of work on overcoming these diÆculties, and analogous ones
in more complex and realistic multilevel situations, using random eects models. In a simple
formulation, (3) is supplemented by:

j = + Æj ;
where Æj

 N (0; Æ2 ). Combining (3) and (4) we get

iid

yi =  + xi + ui ;
where

(4)
(5)

ui indep
 N (0; "2 + Æ2 x2i ):

Equation (5) diers from (3) in having only four parameters to be estimated, instead of
(S +2), and also in that the error variances dier, and depend on the value of the independent
variable. One consequence is that the estimated \school eects" tend to be less extreme.
It has been shown in several contexts that less extreme \shrunken" estimates such as those
tend to be better on average (e.g. Morris 1983).
The basic idea of random eect multilevel models goes back at least to Lindley and
Smith (1972), who introduced the idea in a Bayesian context. Many dierent names have
been used for the general class of models, including multilevel models, hierarchical models,
random eect models, variance component models, contextual models, random coeÆcient
models, and parametric empirical Bayes models. The area has beneted from a superb level
of expository writing; see, for example, Bock (1989), Bryk and Raudenbush (1992), Longford
(1993), DiPrete and Forristal (1994), Goldstein (1995), and Snijders and Bosker (1999). It
has also spawned easy to use software, including HLM, MLn and VARCL, which has helped
to spread the ideas.
Many of the applications have been in education, but there have been important applications in other areas of sociology. One successful application that helped to spread the
methodology arose in demography, to modeling fertility decline (Mason et al 1983; Entwisle
et al 1985, 1986, 1989; Wong and Mason 1985). Another fruitful area of application is metaanalysis, i.e. the pooling of results from dierent studies (Hedges and Olkin 1985; Goldstein
et al 2000).
18

The model can be estimated by maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm, viewing
the random eects as \missing data" (Dempster, Laird and Rubin 1977). The Bayesian
formulation has proved useful in recent years, particularly for going beyond the hierarchical
linear model, of which (5) is an example, to other more complex situations, such as multilevel
models with limited dependent variables, event history outcomes, multivariate outcomes, and
so on. This has proved quite amenable to estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (e.g.
Gelman et al 1995, Daniels and Gatsonis 1999). Recent social science applications include
Bradlow and Zaslavksy (1999), Boatwright et al (1999), Datta et al (1999), and Elliott and
Little (2000). This seems to be a fruitful area for future research.
3.7

Missing Data

Missing data is pervasive in social science. By far the most common approach to dealing
with it has been listwise deletion, in which cases with missing data on any of the relevant
variables are removed from the analysis. Sometimes variables with a great deal of missing
data are removed from the analysis as well. This works well as long as it does not lead to
too many cases being removed: unbiased parameter estimators remain unbiased given that
the missing data are missing at random, and the main problem is the loss of precision due
to the reduction in the amount of data.
However, this approach starts to break down if the number of variables is considerable and
the amount of missing data signicant, as then much of the data can end up being removed.
Various ways around this problem have been tried. One of these, mean imputation, in which
the missing value is replaced by the mean of the variable over the cases for which it is
observed, can lead to biased estimates and is not to be recommended; unfortunately, it is
frequently used, and it is even available in some widely distributed commercial software.
Single imputation, also called regression imputation, consists of replacing the missing value
by its conditional expectation given the values of the other variables for the case, estimated
by regression. This gives unbiased estimates, but tends to underestimate standard errors
and other measures of uncertainty, to an extent that increases with the amount of missing
information.
A consensus seems to be building that the method of choice for missing data is multiple
imputation (Rubin 1977). This consists of simulating several replicates of the missing data
from an approximate conditional or posterior distribution of the missing data given the
observed data. These can then be combined to provide a composite inference that takes
account of uncertainty about the missing data, does not discard any data, and is relatively
19

easy to use (Little and Rubin 1987; Rubin 1987, 1996). This consensus is not a total one,
and multiple imputation has been criticized and alternative suggestions made (e.g. Fay 1996;
Rao 1996). It is possible, but more complicated, to specify a model for the missing data,
and to compute maximum likelihood estimates for the model (regression) parameters using
the EM algorithm, taking account of the missing data and of uncertainty about them (Little
and Rubin 1989; Little 1992).
The motivation for multiple imputation was Bayesian, and the resulting inferences are
approximately Bayesian. Recently, a more exact Bayesian approach to this problem has
been developed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (e.g. Schafer 1997). This extends multiple
imputation by allowing one to simulate values of the missing data and of the parameters
at the same time, to yield a sample from a posterior distribution of the parameters that
takes full account of the missingness. This yields more accurate estimates and statements
of uncertainty than Rubin's original version of multiple imputation, but it is also more
cumbersome to implement.
Multiple imputation relies for its validity on the assumption that whether or not a particular value is missing is in some sense random and independent of the other data. The
technical term \missing completely at random" (MCAR) was coined to denote the situation
in which missingness is statistically independent of all the data, observed and unobserved.
It turns out, fortunately, that this rather demanding assumption does not have to be met
for multiple imputation to be valid. Instead, the missingness needs only to be conditionally
independent of the unobserved data given the observed data, a condition technically referred
to as \missing at random" (MAR). This latter condition holds, at least approximately, in
many situations. It does not hold, however, if the missingness is related to the missing
data themselves (e.g. if people with higher incomes are more likely to refuse to say what
their income is). We have previously discussed one approach to this more diÆcult problem
of \nonignorable missingness" in the specic case of event history data, using the SURF
model.
3.8

Causality

The goal of much of the regression and other statistical modeling that we have been discussing
is, at least implicitly, to make statements about the mechanisms that underlie social life,
social behavior and social structure. In other words, to make causal statements. Statisticians,
on the other hand, have tended to avoid the language of causality, cautioning that statistical
models can show association between variables, but cannot prove that the association is
20

causal in origin.
The regression approach to causality has loomed large in social science because it seems
to t well with how empirical social researchers proceed. Much of (social) science proceeds
by a researcher positing a causal theory of how and why a phenomenon occurs, implying
that the presence of some attribute X causes an outcome Y . Data on observed values of X
and Y are then collected. If a correlation between X and Y is observed, it provides some
support for the causal theory, but does not demonstrate it because there are other possible
explanations of the correlation, notably: (a) Y might be causing X instead of the other way
round, or (b) some third (set of) attribute(s) Z might be causing both X and Y .
The most common approach in these circumstances is to collect time-ordered or longitudinal data on X and Y to try to exclude (a), and to collect data on as many hypothesized
common causes Z as possible to try to render (b) less plausible. This is done by \controlling"
for Z , i.e. by assessing whether X and Y remain correlated when cases with each value of
Z are considered separately. If Z can take many possible values (e.g. because it consists of
several variables, or of variables that can take many values), this will not be feasible, and
instead a regression model is built that represents the relationships in a more parsimonious
way. If the \eect" of X on Y remains signicant after controlling for Z , that is taken as
evidence for the posited causal theory. It does not provide a conclusive demonstration of
X causing Y , however. For example, there might be other Z variables that we could not
measure or did not think of.
When there is some additional causal information, such as the presence of an independent
variable that is known to be causally related to one of X and Y but not to the other, causal
inferences can sometimes be made. The basic approach is instrumental variables estimation,
and this is a major topic in econometrics, but I will not discuss it further here.
Several scientists have been trying to make the case that one can infer causation from
observational data in the absence of additional causal information, describing methods for
doing so, and giving examples of its being done. This contention remains controversial. Two
main general approaches to this task have been taken: the structural equation or graphical
model approach, and the counterfactual approach.
The rst of these traditions of causal inference is that of structural equation modeling,
or, more recently, graphical models. This tradition is motivated by the eort to infer causal
structure from the multivariate (perhaps simply cross-sectional) structure of data. Perhaps
the boldest claims about the possibility of doing this were made by Spirtes, Glymour and
Scheines (1993), drawing in part on work by Blalock (1961) and Costner (1969). They
21

argued there that while the saying \correlation does not imply causation" is clearly true for
two variables, it is not necessarily true for three or more variables. As the simplest example,
they considered the case where the correlation structure of three variables, X , Y and Z , is
of the form X Y Z , i.e. X and Z are both correlated with Y but uncorrelated with each
other. They pointed out that in this case, most people would agree that the causal structure
of the data is of the form X ! Y
Z , and they gave conditions under which this inference
would be correct.
Extending this work, Spirtes et al (1998) considered linear structural equation models,
and asked several questions that arise. If there is a causal model that ts the data well,
are there other equivalent models that imply the same covariance structure but a dierent
path diagram, and if so, how many are there? Given that there are equivalent models, is
it possible to extract the features common to all of them? When does a non-zero partial
regression coeÆcient correspond to a non-zero coeÆcient in a structural equation? They
provided answers to some of these questions using the key property of d-separation, dened by
Verma and Pearl (1988). This can be viewed as a generalization of the concept of conditional
independence. This makes it possible to read causal relations o the graph.
The second major current approach to causal inference is the counterfactual one. This
starts from the idea that the randomized experiment with perfect compliance and no missing
data is the gold standard for estimating the causal eects of treatment interventions. In social
science, randomized experiments are sometimes done to estimate treatment eects, e.g. the
eects of social programs. However, unlike randomized experiments in some other areas of
science, such experiments suer from the problem of noncompliance | some subjects refuse
the treatment to which they are assigned. These experiments also tend to suer from missing
data.
The counterfactual approach to estimating causal eects from such experiments was
rst proposed by Rubin (1974) in the context of what later became known as the Rubin
Causal Model. An accessible description of this framework was provided by Holland (1986);
see also Manski (1993, 1995), Manski and Nagin (1998) and Heckman and Hotz (1989).
This approach was illustrated by Barnard et al (1998), who described methods for dealing
with both noncompliance and missing data in this framework, illustrating their points with
issues from the analysis of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, a natural randomized
experiment.
Sobel (1990, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998) has investigated the application of the counterfactual
framework to observational data, which is more common in sociology than the (imperfect)
22

randomized experiments that Rubin and his collaborators have considered. Sobel argues that
when using data from observational studies, sociologists should attempt to identify causes,
and then think about the covariates that would justify invoking the assumption of conditional
random assignment, and attempt to measure these in the study. In Sobel (1998) he applied
his reasoning to an attainment model of Featherman and Hauser (1976), concluding that
the \eects" of family background on educational attainment and occupational achievement
should not be viewed as causal. Sobel's conclusion in what would often be regarded as a
rather clear-cut case of a causal eect suggests that few observational studies in sociology
would meet his criteria for causal inference to be possible. Simplistically put, this is because
one can rarely be sure that there is no unmeasured common cause out there. This is a useful
caveat, as is his detailed description of the relatively rare cases when causal inference from
observational studies will be possible.
However, much of sociology is about marshaling evidence for competing causal explanations, and observational studies can allow one to do this, regardless of whether or not they
allow us to show any causal explanation to be correct in an absolute sense. Such studies do
provide a basis for saying which of the current causal theories is best supported by the data.
The most common way of doing this is by testing one or several coeÆcients in a regressiontype model for signicance. This has the limitation that it can be used only to compare pairs
of theories that correspond to nested statistical models. Often, however, competing theories
do not neatly t inside one another in this way, but instead correspond to quite dierent
ways of explaining a phenomenon, and so do not correspond to nested hypotheses. In this
case, standard statistical signicance testing becomes diÆcult. However, Bayes factors can
still be used to make these comparisons (Kass and Raftery 1995; Raftery 1995).
The search for causal explanation, although widely accepted as the basis for much social
research, is not uncontroversial. For example, Abbott (1998) argued that the regression
model of causality, although dominant in American sociology, is too narrow and needs to
be expanded to include broader concepts of explanation and to reinstate the central role of
description. He put forward the historical narrative-based approach as one way of achieving a
more compelling and interesting account of social life. He mentioned nonstatistical simulation
models and cluster analysis as potentially useful methods in this context, allowing one to
describe relational and spatial aspects of social life, as well as temporal ones. This kind of
\noncausal", or \postcausal" thinking is an important ingredient in the development of the
third generation of methods, to which we now turn.

The Third Generation: New Data, New Challenges,
New Methods

4.1

Social Networks and Spatial Data

Social networks consist of sets of pairwise connections, such as friendships between adolescents (Udry and Bearman 1998), sexual relationships between adults (Laumann et al 1994),
or patterns of marriage exchange and political alliance across social groups (White 1963;
Bearman 1997; Padgett and Ansell 1993). The analysis of data about such networks has
a long history (Wasserman and Faust 1994). Frank and Strauss (1986) developed formal
statistical models for such networks related to the Markov random eld models used in
Bayesian image analysis, and derived using the Hammersley-Cliord theorem (Besag 1974).
This has led to the promising \p " class of models for social networks (Wasserman and Pattison 1996). An alternative approach to formal statistical modeling of social networks based
on Goodman-type association models is due to Yamaguchi (1990).
Methods for the analysis of social networks have focused mostly on small data sets with
complete data. In practical applications, however, such as the eect of sexual network
patterns on the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (Morris 1997), the data tend to be
large and very incomplete, and current methods are somewhat at a loss. This is the stage that
pedigree analysis in statistical genetics was at some years ago, but the use of likelihood and
MCMC methods have led to major progress since then (Thompson 1998). Social networks
are more complex than pedigrees in one way, because pedigrees tend to have a tree structure,
while social networks often have cycles, but progress does seem possible.
Most social data are spatial, but this fact has been largely ignored in sociological research.
A major exception is Massey and Denton's (1993) study of residential segregation by race,
reviving a much older sociological tradition of spatial analysis in American society (e.g.
Duncan and Duncan 1957). More recently, the eld of research on fertility and contraception
in Asia (several major projects focused on China, Thailand and Nepal) has been making
fruitful use of satellite image and Geographic Information System (GIS) data (e.g. Entwisle
et al 1997).
More extensive use of spatial statistics in sociology seems likely. Spatial statistics has been
making great progress in the past two decades. The two most fruitful approaches to modeling
spatial dependence have turned out to be those based on geostatistics (Matheron 1971, Chiles
and Delner 1999), and on Markov random elds (Besag 1974, Besag, York and Mollie 1991).
Geostatistics models spatial correlation taking account of distance explicitly. Markov random
24

elds, on the other hand, are based on a notion of neighborhood: an observation is taken
to depend directly on its neighbors, and to be conditionally independent of all other cases
given its neighbors. Markov random elds seem promising for social data if they are fairly
regularly spaced, but for unevenly spaced spatial units, geostatistics may nd it easier to
account for the spatial dependence. For social data, geographic distance may not be the most
relevant; distances dened on the basis, for example, of ows of people or of information may
be more germane for some applications. I do not know of any work on spatial statistical
models based on distances of this type, however.
4.2

Textual and Qualitative Data

In its rawest form, a great deal of sociological data is textual, e.g. interviews, answers
to open-ended questions in surveys, enthnographic accounts. How to analyze such data
formally and draw inference from it remains a largely open question. Eorts at formal
analysis have focused on standard content analysis, consisting mainly of counting words in
the text in dierent ways. It seems likely that using the context in which words and clauses
appear would yield better results. Promising recent eorts to do just this include Carley's
(1993) map analysis, Franzosi's (1994) set theoretic approach, and Roberts's (1997) generic
semantic grammar, but the surface has only been scratched. The human mind is very good
at analyzing individual texts, but computers are not, at least as yet; in this way the analysis
of textual data may be like other problems such as image analysis and speech recognition.
A similar challenge is faced on a massive scale by information retrieval for the Web (Jones
and Willett 1997), where most search engines are based on simple content analysis methods.
The more contextual methods being developed in sociology might be useful in this area also.
Singer et al (1998) have made an intriguing use of textual data analysis, blending quantitative and qualitative approaches. They took a standard unit-level data set with over 250
variables per person, and converted them into written \biographies". They then examined
the biographies for common features, and thinned them to more generic descriptions.
Another approach to the systematic analysis of some kinds of qualitative data has recently
been pioneered by Raudenbush and Sampson (1999) under the name \ecometrics." Their
work was motivated by the study of neighborhood characteristics that could be linked to
crime, such as physical decay (e.g. abandoned buildings), physical disorder (e.g. graÆti), and
social disorder (e.g. drug dealing on the street). A standard quantitative approach to this
kind of problem has been to estimate neighborhood eects using aggregates of respondents
from the neighborhood, but Raudenbush and Sampson argue persuasively that this does
25

not provide independent or \objective" assessments of the environment based on direct
observation. Their data consisted of videotapes and observer logs for about 23,000 street
block segments (Sampson and Raudenbush 1999). They coded these data and developed
a hierarchical model for assessing reliabilities and calculating physical and social disorder
scales.
Raudenbush and Sampson place their work rmly in Reiss's (1971) framework of systematic social observation, dened to include explicit rules that permit replication, and means
of observation that are independent of what is being observed. This seems important for
formal analysis of and inference from qualitative, textual and ethnographic data; the work
of Carley (1993), Franzosi (1994) and Roberts (1997) is in this spirit.
Interestingly, Raudenbush and Sampson point out that the search for individual and ecological eects may overemphasize the individual component simply because the well-studied
individual psychometric measures are likely to be better than the much less studied ecological
ones. Indeed, I have noticed that in many sociological studies, the reported contextual and
neighborhood eects are weak, and the point that this may be due to poor measures rather
than to weak eects is interesting. Data of this kind cry out for spatial statistical analysis.
Raudenbush and Sampson acknowledge this and list it as a topic for future research; their
work to date has not accounted for spatial dependence.
4.3

Narrative and Sequence Analysis

Life histories are typically analyzed by reducing them to variables and doing regression and
multivariate analysis, or by event history analysis. Abbott and Hrycak (1990) argued that
these standard approaches obscure vital aspects of a life history (such as a professional
career) that emerge when it is considered as a whole. They proposed viewing life histories
of this kind as analogous to DNA or protein sequences, using optimal alignment methods
adapted from molecular biology (Sanko and Kruskal 1983), followed up by cluster analysis,
to detect patterns common to groups of careers. Stovel, Savage and Bearman (1996) used
these methods to describe changes in career systems at Lloyds Banks over the past century.
Subsequently, Dijkstra and Taris (1995) extended the ideas to include independent variables, and Abbott and Barman (1997) applied the Gibbs sampling sequence detection method
of Lawrence et al (1993), originally also developed for microbiology; this seems to work very
well.
The approach is interesting, and there are many open statistical questions. These include
questions about the alignment methodology, for example, how should the insertion, deletion
26

and replacement costs be determined? They also include questions about the clustering
method: How many clusters are there? Which clustering method should be used? How
should one deal with outliers? Perhaps a more explicitly model-based approach would help to
answer these questions. Cluster analysis was long a somewhat ad hoc collection of methods,
and reformulating it so that it is based on formal statistical models has helped provide
principled answers to some of these questions in other contexts (e.g. Baneld and Raftery
1993; Fraley and Raftery 1998). An alternative approach to analyzing sequence data based
on loglinear models has been developed by Yamaguchi and Kandel (1998).
4.4

Simulation Models

Another way to represent a social process in more detail is via a macro- or microsimulation
model. Such models are often deterministic and quite complicated, representing systems
by dierent compartments that interact, and each compartment by a set of dierential or
dierence equations. They have been used, for example, to explore the implications of
dierent theories about how domestic politics and war interact (Hanneman, Collins and
Mordt 1995), the social dynamics of collective action (Kim and Bearman 1997), and the role
of sexual networks in the spread of HIV (Morris 1997 and references therein).
A diÆculty with such models is that ways of estimating the many parameters involved, of
assessing the t of the model, and of comparing competing models are not well established;
all this tends to be done by informal trial and error. Methods being developed to put
inference for such models on a solid statistical footing in other disciplines may prove helpful
in sociology as well (Guttorp and Walden 1987; Raftery, Givens and Zeh 1995; Poole and
Raftery 2000).
4.5

Macrosociology

Macrosociology deals with large entities, such as states and their interactions. As a result,
the number of cases tends to be small, and the use of standard statistical methods such as
regression is diÆcult. This was pointed out trenchantly by Ragin (1987) in an inuential
book. His own proposed alternative, Qualitative Comparative Analysis, seems unsatisfactory
because it does not allow for variability of any kind, and so is sensitive to small changes in
the data and in the way the method is applied (Lieberson 1994).
One solution to the problem is to obtain an at least moderately large sample size, as
Bollen and Appold (1993) were able to do, for example. Often, however, this is not possible,
27

so this is not a general solution. Another approach is to use standard regression-type models,
but to do Bayesian estimation with strong prior information if available, which it often is
from the practice, common in this area, of analyzing specic cases in great detail (Western
and Jackman 1994). Bayes factors may also help, as they tend to be less stringent than
standard signicance tests in small samples and allow a calibrated assessment of evidence
rather than forcing the rejection or acceptance of a hypothesis (Kass and Raftery 1995).
They also provide a way of accounting for model uncertainty, which can be quite large in
this context (Western 1996).

Discussion

Statistical methodology has had a successful half-century in sociology, leading the way in
providing models for cross-classications, and developing well-adapted methods for unit-level
datasets. This has contributed to the greatly improved level of scientic rigor in sociology
today. New kinds of data and new challenges abound, and the area is ripe for statistical
research.
What are the future directions? As is implicit in my categorization of generations, I feel
that the questions posed by the types of data that have motivated the third generation of
methods may well spark some of the most exciting developments in sociological methodology
in the medium term. But there are others, particularly related to the kind of data that
may emerge from current technological developments. For example, surveys carried out by
giving computers to respondents and inviting them to respond online, perhaps sporadically
or repeatedly over an extended period, may generate useful data with new methodological
issues of repeated measures at unequal time intervals, missing data (or they may not work
at all). More generally, the Web is generating vast amounts of social science data of new
types, and developing methods for drawing valid conclusions from such data is bound to be
a major future source of challenges.
One direction I would both predict and advocate is that future developments will be
interdisciplinary, spanning the social sciences and beyond. This has not been the case for
most of the twentieth century, during which one social science discipline after another made
the leap to greater quantitative sophistication, but often in relative isolation from one another
and from statistics as a whole. Psychology may have been the rst to make this transition,
with the work of Spearman and Thurstone early in the century, followed by economics,
with the development of econometrics in the 1930s and 1940s by Haavelmo, Tinbergen, the
28

Cowles Commission and others. Then sociology made its move in the 1960s, with the work
of Blalock, Duncan, Goodman and others that we have been discussing here. In the 1990s,
it has been the turn of political science, led by Gary King, Larry Bartels and others, who
have been adopting and adapting modern statistical methodology to their discipline, and
developing new methods in the process.
The pattern in each of these disciplines has been similar. The quantitative transition has
tended to focus on, and in some cases create, the most advanced statistical methods available
at the time, and to spawn a dynamic cadre of methodologists, which in the case of the
disciplines that made the transition the longest time ago, psychology and economics, have
coalesced into their own quasi-disciplines of psychometrics and econometrics. Subsequent
quantitative methodological development has been slower in each discipline, however, and
has tended to remain tied to the methods that were at the cutting edge at the time of the
quantitative transition. Sociology has not escaped this pattern: there quantitative work
remains dominated by the methods rst developed in the 1960s and early 1970s (structural
equation models with latent variables, generalized linear models, event history analysis via
the Cox model), and has focused on developments and renements of these methods. As I
have discussed, there are good reasons for this, and it has had a very positive eect on the
eld as a whole. However, the statistical methods of the 1990s, particularly Bayesian analysis
via Markov chain Monte Carlo, have been eagerly adopted by the cohorts of young political
scientists going through the excitement and turmoil of their own quantitative revolution, but
have been slower to penetrate sociology.
Now, in a more interdisciplinary academic world than that of previous decades, the
opportunity is there for all the social science disciplines to break out of the disciplinary
straightjacket, and to move their quantitative methodologies forward together. Several major institutions have launched interdisciplinary centers and initiatives focused on quantitative social science methodology in the past few years, providing resources for doing just
this. The University of Washington has just established a new Center for Statistics and the
Social Sciences. Harvard's new Center for Basic Research in the Social Sciences emphasizes
social statistics. The new Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science at the University
of California{Santa Barbara is another example, with a focus on spatial statistics. UCLA's
young Statistics Department grew out of social statistics, and retains active interdisciplinary
links to several social sciences. Columbia's new Masters program in Quantitative Social Science is another interdisciplinary enterprise spanning the social sciences and statistics. At the
University of Michigan, the new Quantitative Methodology Program is creating and reviv29

ing joint graduate programs between the Department of Statistics and several social science
departments. These all join what is perhaps the most successful eort of this kind to date:
the Social Statistics Department at the University of Southampton.
