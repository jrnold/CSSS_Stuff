Abstract
Social relationships consist of interactions along multiple dimensions. In social networks, this means that individuals form multiple
types of relationships with the same person (an individual will not
trust all of his/her acquaintances, for example). Statistical models
for these data require understanding two related types of dependence structure: (i) structure within each relationship type, or network view, and (ii) the association between views. In this paper we
propose a statistical framework that parsimoniously represents dependence between relationship types while also maintaining enough
flexibility to allow individuals to serve different roles in different relationship types. Our approach builds on work on latent space models for networks (see Hoff et al. (2002), for example). These models
represent the propensity for two individuals to form edges as conditionally independent given the distance between the individuals in
an unobserved social space. Our work departs from previous work
in this area by representing dependence structure between network
views through a Multivariate Bernoulli likelihood, providing a parsimonious representation of between-view association. Using our
method, we explore multiview network structure across 75 villages
in rural southern Karnataka, India (Banerjee et al., 2013).

Introduction

Social network data record interactions between individuals, known as
actors or nodes. Understanding structure in social networks is essential
to appreciating the nuances of human behavior and is an active area of
research in the social sciences. Typically, human interactions occur on
multiple dimensions. Individuals may be friends and co-workers, for example. The same individuals may also share membership in the same
religious or professional organization. In this paper, we present a statistical model designed to glean structure from social network data collected
about multiple relationships, or views. Our model builds on an active line
of literature (see Hoff et al. (2002)) which uses low-dimensional geometric
projections to represent the (likely high-dimensional) dependence structure in network data. We draw on recent and classic work on models for
multivariate binary data to encode dependence between network views
in the likelihood. This approach models dependence within a network
view using the latent space model, while also parsimoniously expressing
association between network views.
In particular, we address two primary statistical challenges.
1. First, our model must represent dependence structure within each
view. A fundamental challenge in analyzing social network data
arises because dependence between individuals’ responses violates
independence assumptions underlying traditional models. With
multiview data, we wish to model the dependence that is unique
to each relation.
2. Second, we wish to parsimoniously model associations between
views. Conditional on the structure within a particular view, our
model should also represent dependence between tie probabilities
across views. We require this summary to be parsimonious so that
we can easily compare structure across multiple similar multiview
networks. In the data we present in Section 1.1, for example, we examine social and financial relationships between households in 75
villages in India. We require a measure of between-view association
that is transferable between villages in order to explore the relationship between observable village-level covariates and between-view
3

associations.
We now discuss these two challenges in detail and present relevant
related work. First, a key statistical challenge for modeling social network data (either with multiple views or a single view) is representing
the, likely high dimensional dependence structure in the data in a parsimonious and interpretable way. This dependence occurs because the
propensity for any two individuals to form a network relation, or edge,
depends on the other edges in the network. A common network property known as transitivity, for example, implies that “a friend of a friend
is likely a friend.” This feature of network data means that statistical
models developed for independent observations are not appropriate. One
modeling approach, the latent space model (Hoff et al., 2002), represents
this high-dimensional structure through a projection onto a lower dimensional latent social space. The latent social space, according to Hoff et al.
(2002), represents “the space of unobserved latent characteristics that represent potential transitive tendencies in network relations.” The geometry
of the social space becomes a modeling decision with substantive consequences. A latent space defined with a geometry and distance measure
that satisfy the triangle inequality, for example, encodes transitivity. Since
Hoff et al. (2002) proposed the latent space model for network data, the
framework has been adapted to include model-based clustering (Handcock et al., 2007; Krivitsky P. and P., 2007) and indirectly observed network data (McCormick and Zheng, 2012). Variational approximations
also facilitate using the latent space approach on larger networks (SalterTownshend and Murphy, 2013).
The second main statistical challenge in modeling multiview network
data arises when considering the relationship between different types of
network connections. We focus again on latent space models and review
recent statistical work for multiview data in detail in Section 2. We can
summarize this rapidly growing literature as two general approaches.
The first set of methods accounts for multiple relations through additional structure in the latent space. This approach amounts to adding
additional structure to the residual term. A second approach focuses on
the data, using low dimensional representations of similarity to construct
“aggregate” networks.
4

We present an alternative, fundamentally different, approach to modeling the relationship between network views. More formally, we model
the vector of responses for each pair of individuals as arising from a
distribution, which we refer to as the Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution (MVB), for multivariate binary data. We note that this model differs
from a multinomial representation because individuals are allowed (and
in some cases expected) to have ties across multiple views, meaning the
marginal tie probabilities across all views are not restricted to sum to
one. To account for dependence between dyads, we use a conditional
latent space model for each network view. This combination provides a
parsimonious representation of the association between views while also
encoding network structure within each view. A simple representation of
association between views is essential in our case to represent patterns of
associations across the 75 villages.
Whereas previous approaches examine the relationship between views
through additional structure in the residual, or latent space, we model between view structure using a multivariate likelihood across views. When
then use latent spaces specific to each view to account for within view
network dependence. In previous work, the propensity to form ties between any two individuals in any view is conditionally independent of
all other views and pairs given the latent structure. In this approach the
model’s residual component captures both within view and between view
dependence. In our approach, the dependence between views is part of
the likelihood. The residual component of our model captures structure
within a particular view, whereas excess variation between views that
exists after accounting for within view dependence arises through the
likelihood.
There is an extensive literature on statistical models for multivariate binary data. The model we present is most related to work arising
from classical literature in loglinear models (see Cox (1972), for example). The likelihood framework we present was first described in this
literature, then presented again recently in Dai et al. (2013) where the authors prove statistical properties of the MVB distribution. These models
are described, among other places, in the seminal text of Bishop et al.
(1975) and more recently in Wakefield (2013). Previous work has also explored multivariate likelihoods for network data. Fienberg et al. (1985),
5

for example, model multiview network data using a generalization of
the p1 models presented in Holland and Leinhardt (1981). More recent
work (Pattison and Wasserman, 1999) includes additional network features. Our approach differs from this earlier work in the way that we represent structure in the network, opting for the more flexible latent space
representation rather than parameterizing in terms of network attributes.
In the remainder of this section, we present details of data collected as
part of a micro finance experiment in Karnataka, a state in southern India. We are interested in a joint characterisation of between network view
dependencies and within network view structure. Section 2 presents recent work on latent space models for networks, providing further context
for our proposed novel model, which is described in Section 3. We implement our model on the Karnataka data in Section 4. Section 5 provides a
discussion and addresses future challenges.

1.1

Multiview network data from Karnataka, India

We examine data consisting of multiple network views collected from
75 villages in rural southern Karnataka, India. The data were collected
as part of a micro finance experiment and, thus, contain both views related to social and familial interactions (being related or attending temple
together, for example) and views related to economic activity (lending
money or borrowing rice/ kerosine, for example). Work in the economics
literature has addressed the importance of the relationship between these
views in outcomes such as sharing risks or exchanging favors. Jackson et
al. (2012), for example, construct a measure of social support in each view
and compare the relative level of support provided by each view within
the same village. Jackson et al. (2012), find that their measure of support
is consistently (72 out of 75 villages studied) higher for closer social relationships (such as visiting) than for “intangible” relationships (such as
attending the same temple).
For each village, data consist of a census of all households in the village and detailed network information from a subset of village members.
Villages range in size from about 350 members to about 1800, corresponding to approximately 75 to 350 households. Villages vary substantially in
terms of wealth, religion, and language. Bharatha Swamukti Samsthe (a

microfinance institution) identified these villages as places it planned to
begin operations, with rollout happening during the data collection period. Data about participation in the microfinance program can be linked
to the household census.
The goal of our method is to describe the dependence structure between these various forms of interaction. To illustrate the complexity of
this task, Figure 1 shows six network views for one village. These views
arise by collapsing the twelve views in the data into six major categories
(see Section 4). Actors are arranged in the same order around all panels. The views differ in terms of both volume and structure. The graph
representing co-attendance of temple, for example, is relatively sparse in
this village. The panel representing social interactions, however, is quite
dense. Describing structure across the views is also challenging. There
are some persistent interactions, indicated most clearly in Figure 1 by the
persistent horizontal lines about one-third of the way down the circles. A
large portion of individuals, however, interact with one another on only
some subset of these relations. Furthermore, each view has its own de-

7

pendence structure with broad network properties, such as transitivity,
playing different roles in each view. There is also considerable variability
across villages. In villages with more religious homogeny, for example,
the temple attendance relationship is often as dense as interacting socially
in Figure 1.

Latent space models for network data

In this section we review a substantial literature in latent space models
for networks. We begin by presenting the latent space model for a single
network view. We then pay particular attention to latent space approaches
to multiview network data.

2.1

Models for a single relation

Although our model for multiple network views can be used to extend
any statistical model for single view networks, we will introduce it with
the latent space suite of models. We therefore frame our discussion entirely in this setting. The latent space model for networks (Hoff et al.,
2002) assumes that the propensity for pairs of actors to form edges is
conditionally independent given the positions of the actors in an unobserved low dimensional social space. That is for actors i and j with latent
position vectors zi and z j and with a network density α,
P(i → j|α, zi , z j ) ∝ f (zi , z j , α).
If yij = 1 in the presence of an edge from i to j and yij = 0 in the absence
of an edge from i to j, then we model the data using a logistic regression
model with the latent space having a Euclidean distance measure;

yij

i,j


1−yij
× 1 − logit−1 (α − |zi − z j |)
.
Note that the likelihood is effectively a Bernoulli likelihood for each link
and that these are conditionally independent given the latent space positions and density parameter.

2.2

Models for multiple relations
(r )

Consider now the case where yij = 1 if there is a edge from i to j on relation r, with data on r = 1, . . . , R and R > 1. We assume that the relations
are distinct, though in practice dependent since they are all realizations
given one particular set of actors.
We might choose to model all views separately and sequentially (independence model), collapse all views into an single aggregate network or
model all views as depending on the same underlying latent space variables. The aggregation model and the dependence model are closely related; in the aggregation model if any yrij = 1 then the aggregated yij = 1
(r )

whereas in the dependence model all yij are included in the likelihood.
Our proposed method is one of several emerging approaches to handle
multiple view networks that look to compromise between the two extremes of fully dependent and fully independent network views. We also
briefly discuss two other emerging methods for modelling multiple view
networks in this section, one of which also uses the latent space approach
and one that does not. We argue that our approach provides the clearest
and most interpretable estimate of the inter-view dependence.

Unified Graph Representation Greene and Cunningham (2013) propose the creation of an aggregated single relation network based on the
combination of the k-nearest neighbour sets for users derived from each
network view. This is more sophisticated than the simple aggregation. In
Greene and Cunningham (2013) the algorithm to create the aggregated
network is given as:
1. For each view j = 1 to l, compute a similarity vector ~vij between ui
and all other users present in that view, using the similarity measure
provided for the view.
2. From the values in ~vij , produce a rank vector of all other (n − 1)
users relative to ui , denoted ~rij . In cases where not all users are
present in view j, missing users are assigned a rank of (n0j + 1),
where n0j is the number of users present in the view.
10

3. Stack all l rank vectors as columns, to form the (n − 1) × l rank
matrix Ri , and normalise the columns of this matrix to unit length.
4. Compute the SVD of RiT , and extract the first left singular vector.
Arrange the entries in this vector in descending order, to produce a
ranking of all other (n − 1) users. Select the k highest ranked users
as the neighbour set of ui .
Unlike our proposed method, the approach does not yield a clearly interpretable estimate of interactions between the network views.
Latent space joint model Gollini and Murphy (2013) jointly models
multiple network views by assuming that the probability of a node being
connected with other nodes in each view is explained by a unique latent
variable. This is the closest in spirit to the model we propose here insofar
as it extends the latent space model to the multiple view setting. Unlike
our proposed method, the approach does not yield a clearly interpretable
estimate of interactions between the network views. There are per-view
network density scalar parameters α and a single latent space to model
the underlying network structure. They employ a variational Bayesian algorithm to perform approximate Bayesian inference in the spirit of SalterTownshend and Murphy (2013). The algorithm first finds estimates obtained from fitting a latent space to each network view independently.
These are then used to find the joint posterior distribution of the “Latent
Space Joint Model”. These results are then used to update the parameter
estimates of each views Latent Space Model and this process is iterated
until convergence. Note that Gollini and Murphy (2013) use the square of
the Euclidean distance as it gives proportionally higher probability of a
link between two nodes that are close than the usual Euclidean distance.
It also requires one less approximation to be made to the log-likelihood
in their Variational Bayes algorithm. We repeat the choice here for similar
reasons.

Multivariate Bernoulli latent space model

We now describe the Multivariate Bernoulli latent space model in detail.
The key feature of our model is a multivariate likelihood that represents
dependence structure between views. We couple this likelihood with
latent representations of social structure within each view.
We refer to the likelihood used for our model as the Multivariate
Bernoulli distribution (MVB). As noted in Section 1, a representation of
the MVB distribution is well-known in the loglinear models literature,
though (to the authors’ knowledge) not referred to by a specific name,
and arises again in recent work by Dai et al. (2013). The MVB extends
the Bernoulli to multiple trials whose successes may be correlated. Note
that unlike the Multinomial (and related models including correlation)
for compositions, the total number of successes is not fixed. We adapt
the MVB theory of Dai et al. (2013) to the network setting, replacing the
Bernoulli likelihood with the MVB. Thus interaction between links enters
the model through the likelihood and we will perform Bayesian inference
on the interaction terms as well as the latent space variables.
(1)
( R)
For each vector yij , . . . , yij , the MVB distribution explicitly allows
correlation across relationships. The MVB distribution is an exponential
family distribution and, thus, much of the model development remains
conceptually unchanged. The model could also be generalized to continuous or valued associations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
We begin first by defining an MVB distribution for a single pair i, j. A
key feature of our model is that the MVB is defined across relations for a
(1) (2)
( R)
single pair. Let yij = yij , yij , . . . ,ij , then

Our likelihood is a product of MVBs. Note that for two relations, the
probabilities p01 , p00 , p10 , p11 define the probability that (y(1) = 0, y(2) =
1) and so forth. The ps are constrained to sum to unity and so we perform
12

inference on unconstrained transformations of these variables. Following
Dai et al. (2013), we refer to these as the natural parameters. For now
we will concentrate on two latent spaces and two relations. Extension to
more is straightforward. We will also assume that each latent space is
responsible for each relation in turn.
The natural parameters are given by:

 00 
p10
f 2 = log

p00 p11

Due to the constraint that p00 + p01 + p10 + p11 = 1 we can also calculate
all ps from these f s:
1
1 + exp( f 1 ) + exp( f 2 ) + exp( f 1 +
exp( f 1 )
=
1 + exp( f 1 ) + exp( f 2 ) + exp( f 1 +
exp( f 2 )
=
1 + exp( f 1 ) + exp( f 2 ) + exp( f 1 +
exp( f 1 + f 2 + f 12 )
=
1 + exp( f 1 ) + exp( f 2 ) + exp( f 1 +

f 2 + f 12 )
f 2 + f 12 )
f 2 + f 12 )
f 2 + f 12 )

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Examination of the terms shows that f 1 is the log odds of getting a
1 in the first relation only over getting two zeros, f 2 is the log odds of
getting a 1 in the second relation only over getting two zeros and f 12 is
related to the log of the covariance. Since the covariance is given by
cov(Y (1) , Y (2) ) = σ = p00 p11 − p01 p10

(5)

then the exponent of f 12 will be 1 for uncorrelated networks, less than 1
for negatively correlated networks and greater than 1 for positively correlated networks. Thus f 12 will be 0 for uncorrelated networks, negative
for negatively correlated networks and positive for positively correlated
networks.
13

In our network setting, we set the first column of x to be all 1s. The
second and third rows are the log-odds of getting a link in only the corresponding latent space. i.e. the probability of a link given that all other
relations are zero for that dyad. For sparse networks this is approximately
equal to the marginal log-odds of a link. The 3 × 3 matrix of coefficients
β is then composed of 3 rows. The first row will multiply by the first
column of x and controls the covariance b/w the two otherwise independent networks. Thus the first two entries (corresponding to f 1 and f 2 , the
increase in log-odds of getting a 1 in the two relations) are set to zero. The
last value ( f 12 ) is set to be non-zero and controls the dependence between
the networks.
The second row is {1, 0, 0} and the third row of β is {0, 1, 0} so that
these coefficients have no effect on the dependence between the networks
and affect the increase in log-odds for the first and second networks respectively.
We can simulate 2 related networks given 2 latent spaces as follows:
1. Draw intercepts α(r) for r = {1, 2}
2. Draw latent positions Z (r)
3. Draw interaction parameter φ
4. Create x as a ( N 2 ) × 3 matrix with columns given by:
(a) all 1s
(b) log-odds of a link for each dyad ij in latent space 1 = α(1) −

6. Calculate xβ; this now holds N 2 rows and 3 columns. Each row
corresponds to a dyad and provides f 1 , f 2 and f 12 for that dyad.
7. Calculate the p00 , etc using Equations 1 to 4 for each row in xβ (each
dyad).
8. Simulate Y = {Y (1) , Y (2) } depending on these ps.
For two views, the likelihood specifies the probability of four distinct
outcomes for each dyad.

Note that as per Section 2.2, we have chosen to model the log-odds of a
link as linearly dependent on the squared Euclidean distances.
Note that the MVB framework readily allows for covariates to be used
in simulating and fitting such models. The method used in Dai et al.
(2013) is to incorporate a design matrix x of dimension n × m where n is
the number of observations and m is the number of covariates. x then premultiplies β which is the matrix of coefficients of dimension m × 3. This
gives a matrix of n × 3 which has values for f 1 , f 2 , f 12 for each observation.

Relationship of Interaction (φ), Covariance (σ) and Correlation (ρ)

We can calculate the pairwise probability of each possible combination of
links for two network views as per Equations 1 to 4 given values of inter(r )
(r )
cepts α(r) , squared distances in latent spaces |zi − z j |2 and interaction
term φ. The covariance between the two network views is then calculable
using Equation 5. The correlation is given by:
cor(Y (1) , Y (2) ) = ρ = p

p00 p11 − p01 p10

( p00 + p01 )( p00 + p10 )( p11 + p01 )( p11 + p10 )

Note that this is the correlation given values for the intercepts, latent
positions and interaction term.

In this section we fit our model to data to multiview data describing
social relations between households in Karnataka, India. As discussed
previously, these data arise from 75 villages with little interaction between
villages and thus provide a unique opportunity to explore how diversity
in network structure across villages is related to association across views.
In addition to information on network structure for multiple views, we
also have household and individual level covariates that we aggregate to
construct village-level characteristics.
As stated in Section 1, our goal is to understand the relationship between network views across villages, thereby understanding how variability in network structure and other observable covariates are related to
the association between views. We do this by first fitting our Multivariate Bernoulli latent space model to each village to estimate between-view
association. We use Gaussian priors on model parameters with diffuse
hyper priors and implement our model using the emerging No-U-Turn
sampler (Hoffman and Gelman, 2013), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo. The reasons for this choice are that it gives us good mixing due to
the Hamiltonian calculations used to optimize the multidimensional proposals in the MCMC chain and there is already software available to run
it (Stan Development Team, 2013). For each village, we ran four chains
initialized using distinct, randomly selected starting values. Computation
time for a particular village ranged from under an hour for the smallest
village to several days for the largest village. Additional computational
details and convergence diagnostics are presented in Appendix B. We
could also have used a Variational Bayes approach such as that used in
Salter-Townshend and Murphy (2013) but we wish to retain as much of
the posterior dependency structure as possible.
After fitting the model to a given village, we explore trends in association parameters across the villages using regression models. The
outcome in these models is the association measure for a given village
and covariates include village level information about religion, language,
and overall economic wellbeing.
Before turning to the results, we note that our association measure reflects residual structure between views while accounting for within view
structure through the latent space model. Again drawing heavily on the
deep literature of log linear models, we refer to our measure as a condi17

tional association measure since the measure is conditional on the latent
positions representing within-view social structure. As a comparison, we
also examined graph correlation (Butts and Carley, 2005). We refer to
graph correlation as a marginal association measure as it measures association between views without accounting for underlying social structure within each view. Figure 2 shows the graph correlation and our
conditional association measure for a typical village. As expected, our
conditional association is much smaller after accounting for within view
structure. We contend, however, that the measures are representing two
fundamentally different quantities as is evident by differences in sign
as well as magnitude in Figure 2. In Appendix A we demonstrate the
correspondence between the parameters of the interaction part of our
proposed model and the graph correlations for data with no underlying social structure. We then show that this is not the case when such
structure is present, as in all networks other than Erd˝os-R´enyi. We also
demonstrate our method produces substantively different results when
examining its relationship to village-level covariates. if we believe there
is no underlying social structure.
We now move to our main results. For each village we now have an
estimated (posterior mean) association based on the MVB latent model
and a series of village-level covariates. To understand the relationships
between these covariates and between-view associations, we construct regression models where the response variable is the MVB latent model
association parameter and the predictor variables are our observed covariates. We used covariates related to the socioeconomic status (e.g.
proportion of households with a latrine, proportion with a number of different types of roof, or average number of rooms per home), household
characteristics (proportion of households that report having a leader), and
demographics (average time in the village). We also experimented with
models including other village-level covariates (including average age,
language, and religion) though these models did not perform as well using measure of model fit such as AIC. For comparison, we performed the
same procedure using graph correlation as a response variable.
Figure 3 presents the results from our regression models for four view
pairs. Since we used six network views, there are a total of fifteen view
pairs. The remaining views are presented in Appendix C. For each re18

gression coefficient, we can interpret the result using graph correlation as
an increased (or decreased) propensity for people in villages with high
levels of the covariate with an interaction on one view to also have an interaction on the second view. For example, the coefficients for proportion
with a tile and stone roof in the pair medical advice/temple indicate that
in villages where more individuals have tile roofs there is an increase
propensity for those who attend temple together to also share medical
advice. The roof type variables can be interpreted as a crude measure of
socioeconomic status with the thatched roof indicating the most impoverished individuals and RCC (concrete) among the most affluent. These
results then indicate that in villages with more individuals of higher socioeconomic status (roughly defined), the propensity for individuals who
attend the same temple to also share medical advice is higher than expected.
The results using graph correlation do not control for network structure within each view. Using the MVB latent space model, in contrast,
we can explore association between views while controlling for network
structure within each view. In terms of interpretation, the coefficients
for the MVB latent space model now reflect the increased (or decreased)
propensity for individuals in villages with a high value of a given covariate to interact on a second view once they already interact on one view
in the pair, while controlling for the role individuals play within a given
network. Turning back to Figure 3, we see that this distinction has significant implications in some circumstances. In the exchange money/temple
pair, for example, we see that the sign of the coefficients changes from
positive using graph correlation to negative with the MVB latent space
model. This implies that the positive association between these views for
villages with large proportions of tile or stone roofs (individual with relatively low socioeconomic status) seen by graph correlation is confounded
with network structure within each view. In other words, the MVB latent
space results indicate that, controlling for how likely individuals are to attend temple together, individuals within villages with relatively low SES
were less likely to also exchange money. This result is not, in contrast,
due to confounding with network structure when looking at the medical
advice/temple pair. As expected, we also see that controlling for structure through the MVB latent space model also serves to decrease the size
19

of coefficients in several other cases as can be seen with coefficients in the
medical advice/social pair or the financial advice/social pair.

Discussion and conclusion

We present a statistical model for multiview network data. Our model
builds on previous work on latent space models for networks as well
as a deep literature in modeling discrete multivariate data. The proposed method uses a multivariate likelihood to model associations between views, which provides a parsimonious representation of betweenview structure. Conditional latent space models account for dependence
arising from social network structure.
The importance of multiview network models also rises with increasing ability to measure various types of networks using technology. Social
media data such as Twitter or Facebook, for example, provide access to a
wealth of data consisting of multiple types of communications. In Twitter, for example, users can also communicate in either passive or active
relationships. “Following” in Twitter terminology allows a users to see
updates from another user but typically does not require approval or
interaction with the user being followed. Interactions can also be more
active and conversational, however, with the individuals using the @reply
command or contributing to broader conversations by including a #hashtag identifier in their tweet. Twitter users project their thoughts toward
an imagined audience of networked individuals, some of whom bear reciprocal edges to the users themselves and some of whom do not. This
interesting mix of public and private attention requires users to maintain a balance between transparency and authenticity in the material they
choose to tweet.
A natural alternative to our approach would be to encode betweenview dependence through a more flexible representation of the latent
space (a latent manifold, for example). This approach can be thought
of as imposing structure on the model residuals. our method, in contrast,
models the correlation between tie probabilities across views directly. We
could also approach these data using methods based on matrix factorization. In the context of networks, recent work (Hoff, 2011a,b) explores
20

representing latent structure through a PARAFAC decomposition.
The conditional latent space approach provides flexibility in modeling
social network structure within each view. Our method does, however,
share difficulties related to model selection that are common in latent
space models. Selecting the dimensionality of the latent space remains a
topic of research with these models. In our case, we use the latent space
to account for within-view structure but do not emphasize interpretation of the latent representation. We fixed the dimensionality of the latent
space to be the same across all views to encourage comparable interpretation across views. We experimented with multiple latent dimensions and
found that the association measures were relatively insensitive, though
more exploration of this area could be done for different modeling objectives.
The conditional representation also makes interpretation of the latent
distances a challenge. This issue is well-known in the loglinear models
literature. Alternative models for multivariate binary data have been proposed, but these models also have substantial issues with interpretation,
often in ways that are less straightforward to interpret than the likelihood
used here (see Wakefield (2013) for a review). In our application, the main
focus is on understanding the association between village-level covariates
and views. In other applications, however, interpreting marginal tie probabilities within a view may be a priority. In such instances, we can obtain
posterior distributions over these probabilities during sampling.

A

Difference Between Marginal and Conditional
Graph Correlations

In order to demonstrate the difference between the conditional correlations inferred by our model and raw (marginal) graph correlations, we
present results on some simulated datasets. We will show that in the
absence of any underlying latent structure to each network view (effectively Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs), our method returns values close to the graph
correlations. However, when there is a non flat network topography our
method is preferable to such marginal correlations. We simulated 3 net-

21

works with a ground truth interaction matrix given by



N A 4.42
3.49
φ =  4.42 N A
−1.50  .
3.49 −1.50 N A

(7)

As this is a symmetric matrix with just 3 unique terms we will report it
and related matrices as vectors of length 3 with terms corresponding to
view pairs (1, 2), (1, 3) and (2, 3) respectively. Thus the interaction values
are
φ = (φ12 , φ13 , φ23 ) = (4.42, 3.49, −1.5).
(8)
We explore two versions of the simulated data here. The first version
has all latent positions in each network view set to zero (i.e. no latent
space structure) and the second version has randomly generated latent
positions. We report results for multiple (20) runs of both versions, each
involving the generation of random data and subsequent application of
gcor (Butts, 2010) and our method to infer inter-network-view correlations. In both versions, we simulated the joint 3-network-view links as
per our Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution.

A.1

No Latent Structure

For the version with no latent structure the ground truth correlations
ρ between each pair of views is constant across simulation runs and is
calculated (using Equation 6) to be
ground truth:

ρ = (ρ12 , ρ13 , ρ23 ) = (0.383, 0.349, −0.067).

(9)

The raw graph correlations mean and standard deviations across the
20 simulations were found to be:
ρˆ = (0.515, 0.307, −0.001)

sρ = (0.027, 0.020, 0.018).
(10)
Note that there is no equivalent φ matrix for this version of correlation.
We then fit our model using our MCMC algorithm and obtain draws
from the posterior for the latent positions Z, intercepts α and interactions
gcor:

22

φ. We find that the mean across 20 simulations of the posterior means
and standard deviations for the posterior means for the interactions are
φˆ = (4.661, 3.635, −1.589)

sφ = (0.224, 0.187, 0.160).
(11)
Thus the algorithm was able to correctly capture the correct interactions
across simulations.
We can also calculate the pairwise covariances and correlations for
given values of the intercepts α and distances between latent positions Z
and then average across MCMC draws to integrate out these terms and
average over all node pairs using Equation 6. We got:

MLSM:

ρˆ = (0.367, 0.333, −0.067)

sρ = (0.012, 0.013, 0.008).
(12)
Although the results from gcor are comparable to the results using our
method for this simulated data without latent structure in the networks,
we note that gcor failed to capture the correct ρ values within the range
of values across the 20 simulation runs, whereas our results for posterior
means span the true values for both φ and ρ and are centred on them.
This is hardly surprising of course as we are fitting the same model used
to generate the data (apart from the inclusion in the inference of latent
positions which were set to zero to generate the data).
We can also examine 95% credible intervals based on the MCMC output for each of the 20 simulations. We found that these intervals included
the correct values of φ, averaged across the 3 view pairings, 90% of the
time. For ρ, it was 85%. Thus, even within a simulation, our posterior
does a good job of inferring the correct interaction values.
MLSM:

A.2

Latent Space Structure

We now report results for a simulation study including randomly generated latent positions associated with each network view. We observe that
the ρ values found by our method now differ more substantially from
the graph correlations. Note that due to the simulation of random latent
space positions, the true ρ values now vary across simulation runs. The
φ values are the same as per the simulations with no latent structure.
23

The true (i.e. values used to generate the simulated datasets) mean and
standard deviations of ρ were:
ρˆ = (0.052, 0.037, −0.003)

sρ = (0.006, 0.005, 0.000).
(13)
Note that the standard deviation of these values across simulations is low.
The raw graph correlations mean and standard deviations were calculated to be:
ground truth:

ρˆ = (0.634, 0.439, 0.145)

sρ = (0.057, 0.065, 0.068).
(14)
These values are far removed from the ground truth, with all 3 far too
strongly positive. This is because correlation due to the latent structure is
dominating the correlations.
Conversely, our method found values of
gcor:

ρˆ = (0.029, 0.018, −0.002)

sρ = (0.006, 0.004, 0.000),
(15)
which are more in line with the ground truth. Across the 20 simulation
runs, we captured the ground truth value of ρ in the 95% credible interval 60% of the time. Thus, in the presence of latent structure underlying
the multiple networks, the graph correlation does a far poorer job of capturing the true correlation between the views. For real datasets, such as
our motivating example, we therefore advocate using a model that jointly
estimates the correlations and the latent structures of the multiple views.
MLSM:

B

MCMC Diagnostics

We wish to check the mixing and convergence of our MCMC chains.
Fortunately, stan provides a convergence diagnostic. This is a scalar associated with each sampled latent variable in the MCMC chain called Rˆ
that is 1 at convergence. For the Karnataka data, the values of Rˆ all α
and φ mix well in relatively few iterations and satisfy the Gelman-Rubin
convergence criteria ( Rˆ max < 1.1). Identifiability issues make it more difficult to access convergence in the latent positions, Z. As with previous
latent space models, the likelihood we propose depends on the latent positions only through pairwise distances. We could use a common rotation
24

to improve the identifiability of the latent positions. Since the remaining
parameters mix well and since we use the φ parameters most extensively
in the results, we chose not to restrict rotations. Across all villages the
latent positions have a have a mean Rˆ of 1.54. We also experimented with
running longer MCMC chains and found similar parameters values and
convergence diagnostics. Along with the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, we
also visually inspected the chains for each village. An example of typical
output for village 72 is given in Figure 4.

Additional results

In this section, we present results for the remaining views not presented
in Figure 3. Figure C presents plots giving point estimates and error bars
for regression models where the outcome is either the graph correlation
or the association parameter of the MVB latent model. Covariates are
village level measures of demographic and socioeconomic composition.
The results support the discussion in Section 4.
