Recent research into the properties of human sexual contact networks has suggested that the degree distribution of the contact
graph exhibits power-law scaling.

One notable property of this

power-law scaling is that for a range of scaling exponents, the variance of the degree distribution is infinite. This property is of fundamental significance for the control of sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) such as HIV/AIDS since infinite variance of the degree distribution implies no epidemic threshold, and that an STD can persist regardless of its transmissibility. A stochastic process, known as
preferential attachment, that yields one form of power law scaling
has been suggested to underlie the scaling of sexual degree distributions. The limiting distribution of the preferential attachment
process is the Yule distribution, which we fit using maximum likelihood (ML) to local network data for samples of three populations:
(1) the Rakai District, Uganda, (2) Sweden, and (3) USA. For all
local networks but one, our interval estimates of the scaling parameters do not overlap the range in which Yule distribution has
infinite variance. The exponent for male networks in the USA is
close to the infinite-variance range, but the preferential attachment
model is a very poor fit to these data. We conclude that epidemic
thresholds exist in both single-sex and two-sex epidemic model formulations. A strong conclusion we derive from these results is that
public health interventions aimed at reducing the transmissibility of
STD pathogens, such as implementing condom use or high activity
anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), have the potential of bringing a
2

population below the epidemic transition, even in populations exhibiting large degrees of behavioral heterogeneity.

Introduction
The course of an epidemic of an infectious disease is governed by a threshold parameter,
R0 , the basic reproductive number (Anderson and May, 1991). R0 represents the expected
number of secondary cases produced by a single index case in a population of susceptibles.
In its most general formulation, R0 is a product of the transmissibility of the infectious
agent, the duration of the infection, and some measure of the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals. Public health strategies for control and eradication are
based on reducing transmissibility, shortening the duration of infection, and reducing the
contact rate between susceptibles and infecteds. A puzzle in sexually transmitted disease epidemiology has been how epidemics are maintained given the the relatively small
number of sexual contacts people have (e.g., relative to the number of contacts for non
sexually-transmitted infections such as measles or influenza). The answer to this puzzle
is that heterogeneity in sexual activity can drive an STD epidemic (Hethcote and Yorke,
1984).
In single-sex models with heterogeneous levels of sexual activity, R0 increases approximately linearly with the variance in sex partner number (Anderson and May, 1991).
Analogous results have been derived for two-sex models (Newman, 2002). Information
on heterogeneity in sexual activity is typically estimated from local network data (Morris, 1997) gathered in sexual history surveys. In sexual network analysis, sexual contact
networks are represented as random graphs, where the nodes of the graph represent individual people and the edges represent sexual contact. The number of edges adjacent
to a particular node is its degree, and the collection of nodal degrees is the degree distri3

bution of the population (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). It is the variance of this degree
distribution which plays such an important role in determining the threshold reproduction number for an STD. An understanding of the degree distribution of a sexually active
population, and the micro forces which generate this distribution is an important step
toward designing public health interventions to eradicate STDs.
Representative surveys of sexual behavior reveal that the typical person has very few
sexual partners in the course of a year (Laumann et al., 1994; Wawer, 1992; Lewin, 1996).
Given this observation, concern clearly focuses on the statistical properties of the tails of
the degree distribution. Recent work on the properties of human sexual contact networks
has suggested that they are characterized by power-law decay of their tails (Liljeros et al.,
2001). These networks are described as “scale free” in the recent network literature. The
key scientific question which arises in this work is not whether a network is scale free or
not, but whether the network’s degree distribution has infinite variance, a phenomenon
occurring in a specific range of the scaling exponent ρ of the power law. A distribution
characterized by a scaling parameter in this range places significant probability on very
large degrees. Consequently, there is no epidemic threshold in a population characterized
by an infinite-variance degree distribution, (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Lloyd
and May, 2001; Newman, 2002) allowing a pathogen of arbitrarily small transmissibility
to be maintained (Lloyd and May, 2001).
The intuition underlying this surprising result is that a network which is simultaneously consistent with (1) the low mean degree characteristic of human sexual behavior,
and (2) the power-law decay of the tail of the degree distribution, will exhibit large connected components. Randomly infecting a node in such a network is therefore likely to
yield a large epidemic. Figure 2 illustrates this idea with a simulated 50-actor (mostly)
heterosexual network with infinite-variance degree distribution (ρ = 2.5). The algorithm
4

for generating this network was essentially that of Molloy and Reed (1995). The giant
connected component suggests that a expected size of an epidemic started by randomly
infecting a single node would be large.
In recent work on the scaling of a variety of systems with possible power-law distributions, the scaling exponent has been inferred from the plot of the empirical cumulative
distribution against degree (or frequency) on double-logarithmic axes. A theoretical curve
is then fit to the apparently linear region of this empirical plot, either “by eye” or using
a curve fitting algorithm such as least-squares regression (Axtell, 2001). The scaling exponent is estimated from the slope of the line. If least-squares is used, the standard error
of the slope estimates is used as a measure of the uncertainty of the scaling exponent.
This is a very poor statistical approach to estimation of the scaling exponent as the
assumptions justifying least-squares regression do not hold. First, the empirical values are
highly correlated (typical sequential correlations are 0.7 or higher). This issue is especially
true for the values for higher degree where the sequential correlation approaches unity.
The additional information in the latter points is very small and visual trends are as likely
to be due to the high correlations as to be real. For this reason considering only the upper
tail of the distribution and inferring a pattern is a very dubious practice. Second, the
statistical variation in the values is not constant and increases rapidly with the degree
(typically by an order of magnitude). This is due to the logarithmic nature of the plot
and the decreasing probabilities. Third, it is usually the procedure to exclude values
from the plot that correspond to zero frequencies (e.g., see Figure 2 in Liljeros et al.
(2001)). These points contain a great deal of information on the degree distribution and
their exclusion introduces bias into the estimates. Fourth, the high degree frequencies are
sensitive to misreporting and population heterogeneity (Morris, 1993, e.g.). While these
can be adjusted for statistically, the least-squares and regression approaches are overly
5

influenced by them. Finally, accessible statistical methodology, such as the likelihood
approach applied here, exists that does not suffer from these defects.
To date, the only empirical estimates of scaling parameters in human sexual networks
come from an analysis of sexual history survey data done in Sweden, a country with an
HIV/AIDS prevalence of less than 1%, and this analysis was subject to the methodological
problems described above. A critical test of the adequacy of the current formulation of
sexual network scaling models therefore comes from estimating the scaling parameters in
a population using robust, unbiased methodology in a variety of populations, including
some with a clear epidemic. In this paper, we estimate the scaling parameters of the
heterosexual contact network in the three populations: (1) Rakai District, Uganda, (2)
Sweden, and (3) the USA.

Methods
Data We use local network data gathered from men and women in as a part of three
large, representative surveys of sexual behavior. The Rakai district is an administrative
unit of southern Uganda with a mature AIDS epidemic and an HIV/AIDS prevalence of
approximately 16%. The primary mode of HIV transmission in Rakai is believed to be
heterosexual. Data were collected as part of the Rakai Project Sexual Network Survey
(Wawer, 1992). Data from Sweden come from the 1996 “Sex in Sweden” survey based on
a nationwide probability sample and financed by the (Swedish) National Board of Health
(Lewin, 1996) Data from the United States comes from the National Health and Social
Life Survey (NHSLS) (Laumann et al., 1994). Neither Sweden nor the United States
is characterized by a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic with national prevalence for both
countries less than 1%. For all surveys, we used the reported number of sexual partners
in the last year as the estimate of individual network degree. Sample sizes are given in
6

table 1.
The degree distributions for the three samples are plotted in figure 1.

Stochastic Model The underlying stochastic model motivating the partnership distributions is essentially that of Simon (Simon, 1955). It is based on two assumptions: (1) a
constant probability (ρ − 2)/(ρ − 1) that the r + 1st partnership in the population is initiated with a previously sexually inactive person, and (2) the probability that the r + 1st
partnership will be to a person with exactly k partners is proportional to kf (k|r), where
f (k|r) is the frequency of nodes with exactly k partnerships out of the r total partnerships
in the population. Simon called the limiting partnership distribution of this process the
Yule distribution, following the pioneering work of Yule (Yule, 1924) The probability mass
function (PMF) of the Yule distribution (Johnson et al., 1992) is:

P (K = k) =

(ρ − 1)Γ(k)Γ(ρ)
,
Γ(k + ρ)

ρ > 1,

k = 1, 2, . . .

(1)

where Γ(ρ) is the Gamma function of ρ. The Yule distribution has power-law behavior
in the sense that P (K = k)/k −ρ is approximately constant for large k. The stochastic
formulation requires ρ > 2,, so the mean of the Yule distribution is defined. For ρ ≤ 3
the variance of the Yule distribution is infinite.

Statistical Inference Consider fitting a PMF Pθ (K = k) to survey information where
θ is the parameter. For example, for the Yule model the parameter is ρ, the scaling exponent. We adopt a likelihood framework to estimate the model parameters and compare
the different models against each other. The likelihood framework provides a set of powerful tools for inference. Given a random sample of n individuals with reported degrees

7

K1 , . . . , Kn the likelihood of the model is
L(θ, kmin |K1 = k1 , . . . , Kn = kn ) ≡

n
Y

log(Pθ (K = km |K > kmin )).

(2)

m=1

A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the θ is a value θˆ that maximizes (2) as
a function of θ. Formulae for the full data likelihoods are given in Jones and Handcock
(2002b).
Although the statistical properties of the maximum likelihood estimator can be analyzed asymptotically, we employ bootstrap methods to quantify the small sample properties of MLEs and calculate confidence intervals (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).
We adapt the model to allow for the possibility that the tail behavior (i.e., k > 1) of
the degree distribution may differ fundamentally from the majority of the observations for
which k = 0 or 1 (May and Lloyd, 2001). We generalize the Yule model to potentially include parameters to fit the probabilities of lower degree (Jones and Handcock, 2002b). To
choose the best-fitting Yule model for the observed data, we employed a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) approach to model selection (Raftery, 1995). The BIC represents
the integrated likelihood of a model and takes into account both the number of parameters a model uses as well as sample size. Given a random sample of size n, (K1 , . . . , Kn ),
the BIC is given by:
ˆ kmin |K1 , . . . , Kn ) + log(n)(d + kmin + 1),
BIC = −2L(θ,
where d is the dimension of θ.

Results The results of the Yule model fits are given in table 1. For all estimates
but Rakai women, the best-fitting model fit the proportions with degree zero and one
separately.

8

For all models but one, the interval estimate of the scaling parameter fall above the
range in which the Yule distribution has infinite variance (i.e., ρ > 3). The 95% confidence
interval for ρ for men from the USA NHSLS sample includes values within the infinitevariance region.
Elsewhere, we have shown the effect of conditioning on higher degree on the confidence
intervals of the scaling parameter estimates for Swedish males (Jones and Handcock,
2002a). However, it is worth noting here that in addition to substantially reducing the
“goodness-of-fit” and increasing the BIC, estimates based on high kmin (e.g., 4 or 5 as
in (Liljeros et al., 2001)) yield wildly increasing confidence intervals.

Discussion
Using methods appropriate to the inference problem, we have estimated the scaling parameter of the Yule distribution, the limiting distribution for the preferential attachment
process, for local sexual network data from three large datasets. The scaling parameter
estimates indicate that the variance of the degree distribution for both sexes is finite in
two out of the three populations, with the plausibility that ρ < 3 only for American men.
The estimate of the Yule scaling parameter for US men was 3.03 and the confidence
interval overlaps the region of infinite variance. However, the Yule distribution was not
the globally best-fitting model for the US data. In a separate paper (Jones and Handcock,
2002b), we have developed a variety of stochastic models for sexual network growth and
estimated them using the same data analyzed here. For the US men, the best fitting
model does not have a power tail, and therefore, has finite variance.
The predictions of the model depend on the form of the population degree distribution. The intuition underlying power-law scaling models is that the tails of the degree
distribution in human sexual networks are long and decrease relatively slowly. However,
9

the extremely high values of the scaling exponents of the Yule model for most of the local
networks indicate that the observed degree, in fact, falls off rapidly within the range of the
data. Models with power tails fit the observed data because of the essentially L-shaped
nature of degree distributions, where the great majority of people have low degree and
a very small outlying fraction have high degree. This observation suggests that a unitary behavioral process, such as preferential attachment, is unlikely to underlie empirical
sexual network degree distributions.
While the language of recent work may be novel in epidemiology, the interventions
suggested by the putative power-law behavior of sexual networks are not particularly
radical, as has been suggested (Liljeros et al., 2001; Dezs˝o and Barab´asi, 2002). Behavioral heterogeneity was recognized as an important contributer at an early date in
the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Anderson et al., 1986) and degree-based interventions proposed
(Woolhouse et al., 1997). Targeting populations such as commercial sex workers (Ford
and Koetsawang, 1999), truck drivers (Morris et al., 2000), army recruits (Nelson et al.,
2002), or injection drug users (Neaigus, 1999) have a proven record in reducing disease
incidence.
Our results suggest that efforts to reduce pathogen transmissibility are not wasted. A
sexual network with finite variance will have an epidemic threshold for positive transmissibility. Indeed, public health efforts aimed at reducing the transmissibility of HIV have
met with great success. Recently, Velesco-Hernandez et al. (2002) have argued that the
use of HAART and other public health interventions in the San Francisco have brought
the R0 for HIV in gay men below threshold and, all things being equal, a slow endemic
fade-out can be expected. Thailand’s 100 per cent condom use intervention for commercial sex workers (CSWs) and army recruits has been a spectacular success in curbing an
incipient generalized AIDS epidemic (Ford and Koetsawang, 1999; Nelson et al., 2002).
10

Much of the recent interest in the scaling of networks has focused exclusively on the
behavior of the degree distribution (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Liljeros et al.,
2001; Dezs˝o and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2002), and some of this work proposes policy recommendations based on the inferred properties of the degree distribution (Liljeros
et al., 2001; Dezs˝o and Barab´asi, 2002). However, there are other features of networks
which could have a substantial impact on epidemic processes. Two structural properties of networks that have received some attention are concurrency and local clustering.
Morris and Kretzschmar (1995, 1997) have documented the impact of concurrency in sexual networks on the speed of epidemics and epidemic size. Networks characterized by
moderate amounts of concurrency (holding degree distribution constant) produce larger
epidemics faster. Watts (1999) has popularized the concept of “small world” networks,
namely, those networks with high clustering and short minimum path length (relative to
the Bernoulli graph). The joint effect of high clustering and short path length means that
an epidemic could spread rapidly through a small world network. Amaral et al. (2000)
note that power-law networks can be small world networks, but power law scaling of the
degree distribution is not a necessary condition for the small world phenomenon.
The limitations of the exclusively degree-based perspective of Liljeros et al. (2001);
Dezs˝o and Barab´asi (2002, e.g.) are highlighted by the fact that infinite variance networks
can have dramatically different structure depending on the values of other network parameters, and that these different structures should be expected to produce qualitatively
different epidemic behavior. In figures 4 and 3, we again present simulated networks
with the same degree distributions as that of figure 2. However, in both these networks,
we further specified the the propensity to form three-paths (i.e., triangles), a measure
of transitivity in networks (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). The algorithm used to generate these networks characterizes the network as an exponential random graph (Frank
11

and Strauss, 1986). Networks were simulated conditional on a the degree distribution
used in figure 2 using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Figure 3, shows an infinite variance
network with a maximized propensity for forming triangles, whereas figure 4 presents an
infinite variance network with minimized triangles. It seems highly likely that epidemic
behavior on these networks, nonetheless characterized by the same infinite variance degree
distribution, would be qualitatively different.
This observation highlights the need to exercise caution in developing public health
policy from information on the degree distribution alone (Liljeros et al., 2001; Dezs˝o and
Barab´asi, 2002), regardless of the inferential proceedures employed to characterize the
network.
The analysis we have provided here indicates that interventions aimed at reducing
transmissibility still have the potential to eradicate STDs. Though sexual degree distributions may have long tails, the models analyzed here are characterized by finite variance.
Both degree-based and transmissibility-reducing interventions have the possibility of lowering the reproductive rate of STD agents below epidemic threshold and should continue
to be pursued in the quest for STD eradication.
