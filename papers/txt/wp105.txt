Abstract
We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for producing probabilistic forecasts of male life
expectancy at birth for all the countries of the world from the present to 2100. Such forecasts
would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries,
which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we
did an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950–
1995, and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent ten years. The ten-year
predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40% less than the current
UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated, in the sense that (for example) the 80% prediction intervals contained the truth about 80% of the time. We illustrate
our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life
expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries.

Every two years, the United Nations Population Division (UN) publishes an updated
edition of the World Population Prospects (WPP), which includes projections of the populations of all the countries in the world to 2050, broken down by age and sex. The UN issues
several variants of its population projections, of which the most important is the Medium
variant, viewed as the best projection of future population trends. It also issues High and
Low variants, obtained by increasing and decreasing the total fertility rate (TFR) by half
a child, respectively. The High and Low variants are scenarios designed to indicate what
would happen if the assumptions underlying the Medium variant were violated in various
ways; they are not probabilistic projections. The UN does not issue variants indicating
the likely impact of differences in future mortality rates. Largely because of the need to
project climate change over the next century, the UN is considering extending its population
projections to 2100.
Fully probabilistic population projections are an alternative to scenarios, which may
be preferable because, unlike scenarios, they indicate the likely range of future population
outcomes (Bongaarts & Bulatao, 2000). To produce probabilistic population projections
for all the world’s countries, one needs probabilistic projections of the main demographic
processes affecting national populations: fertility, mortality and international migration.
This paper is part of a research program aiming to do this. The UN produces many of its
current (deterministic) projections by projecting broad summaries of population processes,
and then breaking them down into age-specific rates using model schedules, to yield the ageand sex- specific fertility, mortality and migration rates that are required by the standard
cohort-component population projection method. Our research therefore focuses on probabilistic projection of summary population measures. Fully probabilistic projections of the
total fertility rate have already been produced (Alkema et al., 2008; Raftery et al., 2009;
Alkema et al., 2011).
The best known approach to probabilistic projection of mortality is that of Lee & Carter
(1992), which uses past age-specific death rates for each year over time in a country. They
used a log-linear model for the age-specific mortality rate at age x in year t, log(mxt ) =
ax + kt bx + εxt , where kt is the mortality index. They project kt into the future using a
random walk model with constant drift. The Lee-Carter method has been found to perform
well for some developed countries (Booth et al., 2005; Bell, 1997). When forecasting a group
of countries simultaneously, a common age parameter is fixed to ensure consistent forecasts
of multiple countries (Li & Lee, 2005).
However, the Lee-Carter method requires that age-specific death rates be available for
at least three time periods, which is not the case for many developing countries (Li et al.,
2004). Also, while the Lee-Carter model specifies changes in age-specific mortality rates to
1

have a constant distribution on the logarithmic scale, White (2002) found that linear changes
in life expectancy gave a better fit to data from 21 industrialized countries. Further, Lee
& Miller (2001) found that the forecasts of the Lee-Carter method for the United States,
Japan, Canada, Sweden, and France systematically underestimated future life expectancy.
Lutz and colleagues at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)
have taken a different approach, producing probabilistic projections from expert opinion.
They addressed data limitation by aggregating countries into regions and forecasting regional
life expectancy based on expert-based probabilistic projections (Lutz et al., 2004).
We propose an approach that is adapted to the UN’s task of projecting populations for
all the countries in the world, many of which have data that are patchy and of variable
quality. We project life expectancy directly. We do this using a random walk model with
a nonconstant drift. The drift term is a nonlinear function of current life expectancy and
reflects the fact that life expectancy tends to improve more slowly for the countries with the
lowest and highest life expectancies, and more quickly for the countries in the middle. Also,
the overall rate of improvement varies by country. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model
(BHM), which allows us to estimate the rate of improvement in life expectancy for a country
using past data from that country, and also taking account of the observed past patterns in
all other countries.
We develop a one-sex model for males and discuss potential extensions to a two-sex model
in the closing discussion section. We use the estimates of historical male life expectancy at
birth from the UN World Population Prospects (WPP) 2008 Revision from 1950 through
2010 (United Nations, 2009). Because of the significant impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
on mortality rates, we do not include countries with a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic in
this analysis. We base our results on data from 158 countries.
This paper is organized as follows. We first discuss the UN’s current projection methodology. We then describe our proposed model, which is a natural extension of the UN’s current
practices from deterministic to probabilistic projections. We assess our model by holding
back the last ten years of data (1995–2005), reestimating our model using only the data from
1950 to 1995, generating probabilistic projections for 1995 to 2005, and comparing them with
what was actually observed.
We then present probabilistic projections of life expectancy to 2100 in three countries
with widely different current life expectancies, Madagascar, Latvia, and Japan, each of
which presents different forecasting challenges. Life expectancy in Madagascar has been
improving steadily but is still in the lowest quartile. Latvia has experienced a mortality
crisis in the past generation, with both declining and increasing life expectancy. Japan is
a leading country, with one of the highest life expectancies. For each country, we present
2

out-of-sample projections for 1995-2005. Lastly, we discuss aggregation of country-specific
projections. Comparisons are made with the recently updated regional projections for South
Asia by IIASA.

METHODOLOGY
Current UN Population Projection Methodology
Currently, the UN projects life expectancy at birth deterministically. The life expectancy
at birth, lc,t+1 for country, c, in the next five-year period, t + 1, is projected to be the life
expectancy in the current time period, lc,t , plus the expected gains in life expectancy, g(lc,t ).
Observed five-year gains in life expectancy for 158 countries from 1950 to 2005 are plotted
in Figure 1. This figure highlights the non-constant rate of change in life expectancy. To
capture this, the UN has developed models that represent the gains in life expectancy by
a double-logistic function of current life expectancy. The five deterministic UN models are
shown in Figure 1(b), where models vary by pace of gains in life expectancy.
The double-logistic function (Meyer, 1994) has six parameters, as illustrated in Figure
2. Four of them identify intervals of life expectancy when the rate of life expectancy gains
is changing, one describes the approximate maximum gain in life expectancy, and the last
parameter gives the asymptotic rate of gains as life expectancy increases. For each country,
a UN analyst chooses one of five prescribed choices of the six parameters1 by assessing the
recently observed pace of mortality decline (United Nations, 2009). The model implies that
after life expectancy reaches a certain threshold, life expectancy increases at a constant rate.
This is consistent with research indicating that there is no evidence of an upper limit to life
expectancy (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002).
The double-logistic function is the sum of two three-parameter logistic growth functions.
Demographic transition theory suggests that life expectancy improves slowly at first, and
then faster as a country enters the demographic transition. The early rapid gains are largely
a result of improvements in infant and child mortality. Once most of the possible gains from
reductions in child mortality have been realized, increases slow as mortality improvements
shift to older ages.
To summarize, the UN projects life expectancy in the next time period deterministically
using the equation
lc,t+1 = lc,t + g(lc,t ).

Using data from different percentiles, the UN developed five models for each sex to describe different
rates of increase in life expectancy: very fast (based on the upper 10th percentile of countries), fast (upper
25th percentile), medium (based on median), slow (lower 25th ), and very slow (lower 10th percentile).

θ c = (∆c1 , ∆c2 , ∆c3 , ∆c4 , k c , z c ).
The parameters θ c for country c are chosen by a UN analyst from the five possibilities.

Stochastic Model
The UN projection method is deterministic and does not account for uncertainty. We now
extend it to a stochastic model to allow for uncertainty. This involves two extensions. The
first allows for stochastic changes within a country by replacing the deterministic model (1)
by a stochastic one by adding a random perturbation to (1). It then becomes a random walk
with drift, where the drift term is given by the double-logistic function.
The second extension is to allow the parameters of the double-logistic function to vary between countries over a continuous range rather than among the current five UN possibilities.

The resulting hierarchical model is
lc,t+1 = lc,t + g(lc,t |θ (c) ) + εc,t+1 ,

where
g(lc,t |θ c ) = Double-Logistic function with parameters θ c ,

z c |σz ∼ Normal[0,1.15] (z, σz2 ),
where Normal[a,b] (µ, σ 2 ) denotes a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation
σ, truncated to lie between a and b.
This model allows us to pool information about the rates of gains across countries by
assuming that each set of country-specific double-logistic parameters is randomly sampled
from a common truncated normal distribution. The normal distribution is truncated such
that all the double-logistic parameters are positive. The first five parameters clearly must
be positive because they correspond to values of life expectancy and maximum gains.
The sixth double-logistic parameter, z c , is the asymptotic average rate of increase in life
expectancy per five-year period. Our prior distribution for this is informed by the results of
Oeppen & Vaupel (2002), who found a strong positive linear trend in the “best practices”
life expectancy (i.e. the highest life expectancy in a given year) from the mid-19th century
through 2000. By assuming that z c is non-negative, we are assuming that life expectancy
will continue to increase on average. In their regression of highest male life expectancy on
year, Oeppen & Vaupel (2002) estimated a slope of 1.11 years per five-year period with
R2 = 0.98. Because this is the rate of increase for “best practices” countries, we assume
that the asymptotic rate of increase for any given country will not exceed the upper bound
of the 99.9 percent confidence interval for this estimate, namely 1.15.
To specify the distribution of the random perturbations, εc,t , we first estimated the model
assuming them to be normally distributed with a constant variance, using the estimation
method described later. Figure 3 shows the absolute residuals from this fit with a fitted regression spline. The spread of the residuals clearly decreases with increasing life expectancy.
To account for this, we modeled the εc,t as normally distributed with standard deviation
proportional to the regression spline fitted to the absolute residuals shown in Figure 3, so
that

εct ∼ N (0, (ω × f (lc,t−1 ))2 ).

Parameter Estimation
We adopted a Bayesian approach to estimating our model, making it a Bayesian hierarchical
model. This requires specifying prior distributions for the 13 world parameters of the model:
2
) for i = 1, . . . , 4, k, σk2 , z, σz2 and ω. We specified prior distributions that are proper
(∆i , σ∆
i

but much more diffuse than the posterior distributions.
We set ∆i ∼ N[0,100] (ai , δi2 ) for i = 1, . . . , 4, k ∼ N[0,10] (a5 , δ52 ) and z ∼ N[0,1.15] (a6 , δ62 ).
We set (a1 , . . . , a6 ) to the values specifying the UN medium-pace model, namely
(15.77, 40.97, 0.21, 19.82, 2.93, 0.40). We set (δ12 , . . . , δ62 ) to the variances of each parameter
among the different UN models, namely (3.56, 3.93, 3.96, 3.80, 0.99, 0.16).
2
For the world variance parameters, σ∆
(i = 1, . . . , 4), σk2 and σz2 , we used inverse-gamma
i
prior distributions with 4 degrees of freedom (i.e. a shape parameter equal to 2). To set

the parameters of these priors, we first fit the double-logistic model by least squares to the
data from each country individually, and then for each parameter we computed the empirical
average squared deviations from the values for the UN medium-pace model. We then set
the prior means of the reciprocals of the world variance parameters equal to the reciprocals
of these values. This yields rate parameters (15.62 , 23.52 , 14.52 , 14.72 , 3.52 , 0.62 ) for the six
inverse gamma prior distributions. The resulting prior distributions are guaranteed to be
much more spread out than the posterior distribution. Finally, a diffuse Uniform[0,10] prior
was used for ω.
7

Experiments showed that the results were insensitive to changes in these priors, which
is to be expected because the resulting prior distribution is much more spread out than the
posterior distribution.
The posterior distribution of the parameters was approximated by Markov chain Monte
Carlo, using the package Winbugs 1.4 (Lunn et al., 2000), run in R using the R function
R2WinBUGS (Sturtz et al., 2005). We used three chains of length 100,000 scans each,
with a burn-in of 10,000 scans. Visual inspection of the trace plots, the Raftery-Lewis
diagnostic (Raftery & Lewis, 1992) and the Gelman-Rubin statistic (Gelman & Rubin, 1992)
all indicated that the chains had converged and had explored the posterior distribution
enough to yield good estimates of posterior quantiles of interest.

MODEL VALIDATION
To assess our probabilistic projections, we fit our model to data from 1950 to 1995 (n =1,422).
We then used the resulting model to forecast life expectancy for males from 1995 to 2005,
and compared the forecasts with what was actually observed. We had 316 out-of-sample
predictions.
Comparing probabilistic forecasts with outcomes is not simple because it involves comparing two different kinds of objects : a probability distribution and a single value (Gneiting
et al., 2007). A probabilistic forecast should be calibrated, i.e. x% prediction intervals should
contain the truth x% of the time. It should also be sharp, i.e. the intervals should be as
narrow as possible.
To assess the predictive ability of our model, we examined numerical measures of calibration via the coverage of our prediction intervals, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE) and the mean standardized absolute predictive error (SAPE). The
standardized absolute predictive error for country c at time t is
r
2 |lct − ˆlct |
act =
∗
.
π
σ
ˆpred,ct
Thus the SAPE is the absolute difference between the actual observed life expectancy (lct )
and the median forecast (ˆlct ), standardized by the standard deviation of the predictive distribution. When the model is correctly specified, the expected mean SAPE value is equal to
one.
These metrics are given in Table 1. Overall, our model was well calibrated with our
95% prediction intervals capturing the actual observations 92% of the time. The empirical
coverage of our 80% prediction intervals was 82%. The mean SAPE was 1.04, which is close

8

to the theoretical mean of 1. The MAE of our median predictions was 1.07 years. Thus our
“best guess” was within just over one year of the actual observation, on average.

We compared the predictive ability of our model with the current UN methodology.
Replicating our cross-validation methodology by using WPP 2008 data through 1995, a UN
analyst computed life expectancy forecasts for 1995-2005 using one of the five prescribed
UN models of gains in life expectancy at birth based on levels and trends in the preceding
two decades. The RMSE and the MAE of our method were both substantially smaller than
those of the current UN method (1), by over 40%.
We assessed the sharpness of our projections using the distribution of prediction interval
lengths. For the 1995-2000 time period, the prediction interval half-lengths ranged from 0.7
to 1.9 years with an average half-length of 1.3 years. For the next five-year period, 2000-2005,
the interval half-lengths increased to a range of 1.0 to 3.2 years with an average half-length
of 1.9 years. Average life expectancy at birth and prediction interval lengths both varied
by region. Among the continental regions from 1995 to 2005, Africa had the lowest life
expectancy of 59.8 years with an average interval half-length of 2.2 years. With an average
life expectancy of 73.5 years and an interval half-length of 1.3 years, North America had
both the highest life expectancy and the narrowest prediction intervals.

forecast from our BHM is similar to WPP 2008 forecasts through 2050. In 2045-2050, the
UN projects male life expectancy will be 69.7 years. We project life expectancy will be 71.4
years with an 80% prediction interval of (65.5,77.8). Fifty years after that, in 2095-2100, we
project life expectancy to reach 80.4 years with a wider 80% prediction interval of (72.6,88.5).
Figure 4(b) shows out-of-sample projections for Madagascar with projections beginning in
1990-1995. UN observed estimates are indicated in the plot by brown squares and are close

our projections for 2095-2100 with a median of 76.6 years and an 80% prediction interval of
(64.7,87.8).
Along with quantiles of the projected life expectancy distribution, in Figure 4(a) (as well
as Figures 5(a) and 6(a) for Latvia and Japan), we also include a sample stochastic trajectory
for Madagascar. We see that unlike the quantiles, the sample trajectory does not follow a
smooth path. For this trajectory the mean absolute deviation from the median is equal to
the median mean absolute deviation among the posterior sample of projected trajectories.
It can be viewed as a trajectory with typical deviation from the projected median.2

This choice of a typical stochastic trajectory was suggested by Joel Cohen (personal communication,

Mortality Crisis: Latvia
Figure 5 shows estimated and projected life expectancies for Latvia. Male life expectancy in
Latvia increased from 62.5 years in 1950 to 66.3 years in 1965. However, in the subsequent 15
years, male life expectancy in Latvia decreased by 2.2 years, to 64.1 years. Life expectancy
increased again until a 3.8 year decline was recorded between 1985-1990 and 1990-1995.
Since then, life expectancy in Latvia has been increasing again. Both the UN and our

70

median projections predict a continuous increase in life expectancy, but ours increase more
slowly.

As can be seen from Figure 5(b), our 80% prediction intervals capture the observed
estimates of life expectancy from 1995 to 2005. For the first time period, from 1995-2000,
the upper bound of our 80% prediction interval was 64.4 years. Yet the lower bound of our
80% prediction interval, 61.1 years, indicates that life expectancy may continue to decrease.
December, 2009).

11

In fact, our prediction intervals allow for the possibility of life expectancy not increasing for
the following 50 years, reflecting the erratic progress over the previous 40 years.

Leading country: Japan
One of the difficulties with projecting mortality is accurately projecting the country with
the highest life expectancy. Historically, “pessimists” believed that life expectancy could not
keep rising at historic rates and assumed that there must be a “ceiling” to life expectancy
for humans (Fries, 1980, Olshansky et al., 1990, Olshansky et al., 2001, Olshansky et al.,
2002, Olshansky et al., 2005). “Optimists”, on the other hand, see no evidence of a limit to
increases in life expectancy (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002, Tuljapurkar et al., 2000, Tuljapurkar,
2005). However, past estimates of the “maximum life expectancy” have continually been
surpassed (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002), and old-age mortality rates continue to decline (Vaupel
et al., 1998). Oeppen & Vaupel (2002) presented evidence that the world’s highest, or “best
practices”, life expectancy at birth has increased linearly across time and shows no signs of
leveling off. They estimated that the “best practices” life expectancy for males has increased
at a rate of 1.11 per five-year period. See Bongaarts (2006) for a review of the historical
debate on life expectancy limits.
Although Japan does not currently have the highest male life expectancy (that title has
belonged to Iceland since 2000), it is the country with the highest overall life expectancy and
has been since 1980. Figure 6(a) is a plot of male life expectancy in Japan. Also included in
the plot is what the trajectory would be if male life expectancy in Japan increased at the “best
practices” rate of 1.11 per five-year period. Vallin & Mesl´e (2009) updated and expanded the
data time period (from 1840-2000 to 1750-2005) for “best practices” life expectancy. They
found a segmented line fit the extended time frame better, with the most recent segment
(1960-2005) still with a strong positive slope (1.13 years per five-year period for women),
and concluded that the Oeppen-Vaupel line may be too optimistic for the long-term future.
Our median projection increases more slowly than the Oeppen-Vaupel “best practices” linear
projection, reflecting the fact that the “best-practices” lines is for the best country at each
time, and thus likely to increase faster than for an individual country. However, the “best
practices” trajectory is just within the upper bound of our 80% prediction interval.
Bongaarts (2006) also found the Oeppen-Vaupel “best-practices” rate to be overly optimistic. By decomposing mortality into juvenile, background, and senescent mortality, he
observed that historically large gains in life expectancy were due to declines in juvenile mortality. Then as juvenile mortality reached low levels, the rate of gains in life expectancy
diminished. The rationale for this decomposition is similar to that for the double-logistic
function, where there are periods of high gains in life expectancy (i.e., when juvenile mortal12

the “best practices” country. A typical stochastic trajectory is also included to illustrate

ity is declining) followed by a leveling off of gains (i.e., when the gains in life expectancy are
due to incremental declines in senescent mortality). Bongaarts (2006) found that senescent
life expectancy in countries with low mortality, on average, increased at a rate of 0.75 years
per five-year period. The average asymptotic rate of gains estimated in our model was 0.84
years per five-year period, which is much closer to the Bongaarts (2006) projected gains in
senescent life expectancy than the “best practices” rate of increase.
Recently, the Japanese official projections made by the National Institute of Population
and Social Security Research (IPSSR) extended the Lee-Carter method to provide more
refined estimates of mortality at higher ages. The original Lee-Carter method estimated agespecific mortality rates for five-year age groups, with the last age group aggregating those
85 and older. The IPSSR now uses the shifting logistic model (Bongaarts, 2005) to account
for continued increases in life expectancy in Japan. IPSSR projections (low/medium/high
rates of mortality decline variants, with the medium variant being equivalent to the UN
projections) (Kaneko et al., 2008) are included in Figure 6(a). The IPSSR projections are
more conservative and project an earlier leveling off of life expectancy than our projections,
but are still within our prediction intervals.
When looking at out-of-sample projections in Figure 6(b), which begin in 1990-1995,
we see that the UN out-of-sample projections suggested an immediate leveling off of life
expectancy, unlike our projections. In fact, the observed life expectancy in 1995-2005 did
not level off and instead continued to increase.

AGGREGATION TO REGIONAL PROJECTIONS:
SOUTH ASIA
Researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (Lutz et al.,
2004) produced regional probabilistic prediction intervals for life expectancy using Delphitype methods. A group of experts were asked to give 90% prediction intervals for future
life expectancy in each of 13 specified regions. Linear paths were then drawn from a normal
distribution to produce probabilistic predictive distributions. This method uses demographic
knowledge as an input whereas time-series methods rely on past trends.
Country-specific projections allow regional projections to be made regardless of how the
region is defined. To compare our projections with those of IIASA for South Asia, we
aggregated UN estimates and projections and our projections to be proportional to the
regional male average populations from 2005 to 2010.3 The countries included in the IIASA3

Regional aggregation by weighted average using total male population is an approximation to the true
regional aggregation. The true computation is more complex and requires the survival ratios by age and

14

defined region of South Asia (with population percentage) are: India (75.1%), Pakistin
(10.5%), Bangladesh (9.9%), Nepal (1.7%), Afghanistan (1.5%), Sri Lanka (1.3%), Bhutan
(0.04%), Maldives (0.02%).
Our model takes no account of correlations between the random perturbations in life
expectancy gains in different countries. Previous work (Alho, 2008) has suggested that
cross-country correlations are non-zero and should be modeled as such. Within South Asia,
in the past 60 years, life expectancies were indeed highly correlated, as follows:

However, for projection purposes, what matters are the cross-country correlations between the random perturbations (effectively the forecast errors) rather than between the
life expectancies themselves. The hierarchical modeling of the change in life expectancy
allows for between-country correlation in life expectancy. We are interested in the residual
correlations in life expectancies gains, ρci ,cj , between countries ci and cj , namely:

These correlations are much smaller than those between the life expectancies themselves,
and in most cases are consistent with the absence of any correlation. Our projection model
has accounted for all or most of the between-country correlation in South Asia.
Country-specific projections were then made by sampling the vector of random perturbations, (δci ,t ), from a multivariate normal distribution whose covariance matrix incorporates

the residual correlation matrix, ρˆci ,cj . The aggregated projections for the South Asian
region are shown in Figure 7. The 2007 IIASA projections available on their website (Lutz
et al., 2008) are also depicted. We found that our median projections were consistent with
sex weighted by their respective population by age and sex. In addition, future weights depend on future
fertility by country, and therefore future weights will change over time.

Figure 7: Life expectancy projections for South Asia (IIASA-defined) for our BHM model,
IIASA and the UN. The median projections for BHM and IIASA are similar with each other,
but the IIASA 80% intervals are wider than the BHM 80% interval.
Our approach yields stochastic trajectories that can fluctuate around the projected life
expectancy. By contrast, IIASA samples random linear trajectories, which change at a
constant rate throughout the projection period, with no fluctuations.

DISCUSSION
We have proposed a Bayesian way to produce probabilistic projections of life expectancy
for all the countries of the world. One possible use of these projections is as inputs to the
United Nations estimation and projections. We have shown by out-of-sample cross-validation
16

that the method gives well-calibrated and sharp prediction intervals, and also gave better
forecasts than the current UN method.
We have restricted our analysis to countries without generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics
because of the singular nature of their demographic impact, predominantly sexually active
adults. To explore the possible applicability of our method to the excluded countries, we
loosened the exclusion rule and fitted our model to all countries with a 2000-2005 HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate of less than 4% (n =179). In the 10-year cross-validation of these countries,
the 80% prediction intervals included the observed life expectancy 84% of the time. Including
the additional countries did not greatly degrade sharpness: the mean absolute error was 1.2
years and the average 80% prediction interval half-length was 1.9 years, compared to 1.0
and 1.7 years respectively without the HIV/AIDS countries. Further research is needed to
generalize our model to countries with a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic while properly
accounting for the uncertainty in AIDS mortality, but these results suggest that the current
model could provide reasonable approximate results.
Our method projects male life expectancy only. Further research is needed to apply this
model to life expectancy at birth among males and females simultaneously while ensuring
that trajectories by sex do not diverge or cross. Lee & Carter (1992) suggested doing this
by modeling the two sexes independently and introducing a new parameter to ensure that
the stochastic trajectories do not cross or diverge. Such a model could also be made more
complex by allowing the double-logistic parameters for the two sexes to be correlated. An
alternative approach would be to combine two stochastic models: one model for one sex, as
here, or for average life expectancy, and a second model for the gap between the sexes.
Our model assumes that the rate of increase of life expectancy will decline in the future,
but that gains will continue, asymptotically at a linear rate on average. It would be possible
to modify the model to allow the rate of increase to decline to zero over time, but experience
to date does not provide much support for this (Oeppen & Vaupel, 2002).
It could also be dangerous. Olshansky et al. (2009) argued that current official forecasts
of life expectancy by the U.S. Social Security Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau
may be underestimated, by about three years for males and eight years for females. They
estimated that this discrepancy could cost as much as $3 to $8 trillion more than currently
projected for Medicare and Social Security. The current official governement forecasts of
U.S. male life expectancy in 2050 are 80−81 years, whereas Olshansky et al. (2009) projected
83−86 years under their two main scenarios, with a range of 78−113 years for their more
extreme scenarios. Our BHM projections are close to theirs, with a median of 84.5 years
and an 80% prediction interval of 82.2−86.4.
Much other research has been done on the forecasting of mortality (Booth, 2006; Dowd
17

et al., 2010). However, efforts have focused on developed countries where reliable age-specific
data are available. The best known time-series method for forecasting age-specific mortality
rates is the Lee-Carter method and its various parallels (e.g., Renshaw & Haberman, 2006),
generalizations (e.g., de Jong & Tickle, 2006; Hyndman & Ullah, 2007; Pedroza, 2006; Koissi
et al., 2006; Brouhns et al., 2002) and extensions (e.g., Li & Lee, 2005; Li et al., 2004;
Ishii, 2008). As discussed earlier, the empirical evidence about the Lee-Carter method’s
performance for forecasting life expectancy is mixed.
There have been other time-series methods to estimate and project age-specific mortality
rates. The Brass relational method fits a two-parameter model where the age-specific mortality rates are assumed to be given by a linear function of a user-chosen model life table
on a logit scale (Brass, 1971). The Heligman-Pollard model is an eight-parameter model
with three parts describing mortality in childhood, young adulthood, and later life (Heligman & Pollard, 1980). Although both models have fitted mortality data well (Keyfitz, 1991;
Hartmann, 1987), difficulties may arise in projecting the parameters (Keyfitz, 1981). Like
the Heligman-Pollard model, the Bongaarts shifting logistic model (Bongaarts, 2005) differentiates mortality at different ages by fitting a three-parameter logistic model and fixing
the slope parameter across time while allowing the other two parameters to vary with time.
However, the shifting logistic model focuses on senescent mortality and may be most relevant
when infant/child and adult mortality are already negligible. Other models have focused on
senescent mortality in terms of biological and evolutionary phenomena that incorporate the
idea of heterogeneity in the population and frailty (Steinsaltz & Wachter, 2006, Yashin et al.,
2000). These approaches require age-specific data.
Instead of modeling age-specific mortality rates, Gage (1993) used a competing hazards model developed by Siler (1979), which was developed for animal mortality. The fiveparameter model describes the hazard function as made up of three components, immature
(or childhood), residual (or background), and sensecent mortalities. Bongaarts (2006) also
suggested decomposing mortality into these three components with future projections focusing on the senescent mortality component. Both approaches require cause of death data,
and Gage (1993) acknowledged that this is a limitation due to issues of data quality and
cause of death classification.
In addition to time-series approaches, there are two other main approaches to developing
probabilistic projections (Lee, 1998). As previously discussed, expert-based probabilistic
projections have been produced by Lutz and colleagues at the IIASA (Lutz et al., 1998, 2004,
2008). However, this method does not explicitly rely on the use of available data, instead
relying on a collection of experts and their ability to specify probabilistic bounds, which may
or may not be accurate (Alho, 2005). The other alternative to time-series methods is ex-post
18

analysis of previous projections (Keyfitz, 1981; Stoto, 1983; Smith & Sincich, 1990). In this
method, previous forecast errors are used to create probabilistic errors on future projections.
Girosi & King (2008) recently proposed a Bayesian method that incorporates covariates
in a linear regression model. However, their approach requires additional data that may
not be reliable or even available in many countries. Pedroza (2006) proposed a Bayesian
approach to the Lee-Carter model by accounting for the uncertainty in the age parameters
as well as the mortality index usually forecasted. Czado et al. (2005) presented a Bayesian
approach to the Poisson log-bilinear formulation of the Lee-Carter model. While the latter
two approaches account for uncertainty in the Lee-Carter model, their generalization to all
countries is hindered by the non-availability of age-specific mortality rates.
