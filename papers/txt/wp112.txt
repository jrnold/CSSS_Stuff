Abstract
The paper is intended to make a contribution to the ongoing debate about declining social
mobility in Great Britain by analyzing mobility tables based on data from the 1991 British
Household Panel Survey and the 2005 General Household Survey. The models proposed
here generalize Hauser’s levels models and allow for semi-parametric analysis of change in
social mobility. The cell frequencies are assumed to be equal to the product of three effects:
the effect of the Father’s position for the given year, the effect of the Son’s position for the
given year, and the mobility effect related to the difference between the Father’s and Son’s
positions. A generalization of the iterative proportional fitting procedure is proposed and
applied to computing the maximum likelihood estimates of the cell frequencies. The standard
errors of the estimated parameters are computed under the product multinomial sampling
assumption. The results indicate opposing trends of mobility between the two timepoints.
Fewer steps up or down in the society became less likely, while more steps became somewhat
more likely.

Introduction
A social mobility table is a cross-classification of individuals according to their own and their
fathers’ social status. If the statuses are ordered, every individual is identified as upward
(downward) mobile, i.e., having a higher (lower) status than his father, or immobile, i.e.,
retaining his father’s status. Since greater social mobility is usually considered advantageous
for a society, results of analyses comparing the patterns of social mobility across years or
between different countries are often given political interpretation. This paper intends to
contribute to the debate about declining social mobility in Great Britain (cf. Saunders, 2010).
A social mobility table does not include a variable characterizing mobility per se, and
mobility trends are usually inferred from the marginals and the association structure of
the table. The marginal distributions reveal changes in the social structure that occurred
between the fathers’ and sons’ generations, and part of mobility can be attributed to those
changes. The association structure of the table, operationalized as various sets of odds ratios,
reflects the chances of individuals who come from different positions to end up in different
social statuses. A weaker association between the fathers’ and the sons’ social position, called
higher social fluidity, implies higher chances of mobility. Although much of social mobility
research is concerned with the analysis of the association structure of social mobility tables
(cf. Goodman & Hout, 1998; Breen, 2008), neither the marginals nor the association structure
quantify social mobility itself, and the question, where is social mobility in the mobility table,
persists.
The methods to be described in this paper are based on the observation that social
mobility is a common characteristic of some of the cells of the mobility table. For example,
if mobility is only considered as being upward or downward, then, if statuses are ordered
from highest to lowest, upward mobility is a common characteristic of cells (and observations)
in the lower diagonal triangle, downward mobility is a common characteristic of the upper
diagonal triangle, and the cells on the main diagonal are characterized by immobility. If
social status is considered to have many categories, then mobility can be categorized by the
number of steps up or down from the father’s position, forming mobility bands parallel to
the main diagonal, and the models considered in this paper include effects associated with
these bands of mobility. The mobility effects are not based on any of the variables forming
the table, and thus these models are coordinate free.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, the structure of a social mobility table, as
well as the concepts of absolute and relative mobility are explained in more detail. The most
frequently used models for social mobility, including the model of common social fluidity and
the UNIDIFF model, are reviewed.

The data used for the analysis in this paper are described in Section 2. These father’s
position by son’s position by year mobility tables were also analyzed by Devine & Li (2011)
and are based on the British Household Panel Survey (1991) and on the General Household
Survey (2005). Previously, Goldthorpe & Mills (2008) analyzed these data among other data
sets in a larger study of trends in social mobility. Some of the results reported in the two
papers are different due to somewhat different derivation procedures of the mobility tables.
For men, Devine & Li (2011) found a significant decrease in upward mobility and a significant
increase in downward mobility from 1991 to 2005, while Goldthorpe & Mills (2008) arrived
to almost identical rates of the upward mobility in 1991 and in 2005. However, based on
the estimates under the UNIDIFF model, both papers concluded that social fluidity for men
was increasing.
The coordinate free relational models (Klimova, Rudas, & Dobra, 2012) that are proposed
for the analysis of social mobility tables are given in Section 3. Under these models, the cell
frequencies are equal to the product of the effects that exist under conditional independence
of respondents’ and their fathers’ positions given year, that is the father by year and son by
year effects, and the effects associated with the subsets of cells exhibiting the same level of
social mobility. Mobility is measured by the number and direction of steps from the origin;
the diagonal (immobile) cells are unconstrained by these models. The model assuming
that social mobility changed between 1991 and 2005 is tested against a more restrictive
model assuming no change. The maximum likelihood estimates of the cell frequencies are
computed using an algorithm that generalizes the traditional iterative proportional fitting
(IPF) procedure and is given Section 3. The generalization proposed here adjusts the sums
of the cell frequencies for subsets of cells that exhibit a common effect in the model to their
observed values. Finally, the standard errors of the estimated parameters are computed
under the product-multinomial sampling assumption using the approach of Lang (1996).
The results of the analyses are discussed in Section 4. The model of no change does not
fit well, and thus the data provide some evidence that mobility in Great Britain changed
between the two timepoints. The model allowing change in mobility, but assuming that the
mobility effect, in each year, depends only on the number and direction of steps taken by an
individual, fits well. The parameter estimates for mobility effects obtained from this model
indicate opposing trends of mobility between 1991 and 2005. In 2005, fewer steps up or down
in the society became less likely than in 1991, while more steps became more likely. These
results provide a finer picture of the patterns of change in social mobility in contemporary
Great Britain than earlier analyses did.

Models of Social Mobility

A social mobility table is a cross-classification of two variables - Origin, the position in the
society from which an individual came, and Destination, the position which the individual
is now having. Origin usually refers to the Father’s status (e.g. Father’s job, when the
respondent was at the age 16), and Destination refers to Son’s status (e.g. respondent’s
current full-time job).
A mobility table can be characterized by rates of absolute mobility and by rates of
relative mobility. Absolute mobility comprises the upward mobility and downward mobility
and is expressed as the percentage of the respondents who moved, respectively, up or down
compared to their origin. Relative mobility is described by the association structure of the
table and is expressed in terms of the odds ratios
pii /pij
.
pji /pjj
Thus, relative rates indicate the chances of an individual from the class i to stay in this class
rather than move to the class j, relative to the chances of an individual from the class j to
move to the class i rather than stay in class j (cf. Goldthorpe & Jackson, 2007).
Perfect mobility means independence between Father’s status and Son’s status, and under
this model, the log cell probabilities in the mobility table can be written in the log-linear
representation of
log pij = λ + λFi + λSj ,

(1)

where λFi and λSj are effects associated with Father’s status and with Son’s status, respectively. This model does not fit most data sets, because of too many immobile observations,
that is sons who retained their fathers’ positions. The model of quasi-independence (Goodman, 1968) entirely removes restrictions from the diagonal cells by allowing for additional
parameters:
log pij = λ + λFi + λSj + δii .

(2)

Under the levels model (Hauser, 1978), also called topological model (Hout, 1983), the log
cell probabilities are sums of the effects associated with Father’s status, Son’s status and
some interaction effects, that are assumed to be identical for all cells that belong to the
same level. The levels are determined empirically from the ratios of the frequencies expected
under the model of independence to those observed. Clogg & Shockey (1984) suggested that
cells belonging to the same level have to share some common substantive property. In turn,
Kov´ach, R´obert, & Rudas (1986) considered levels consisting of contiguous cells. Models
which accounted for the social distance between Father’s and Son’s statuses, as if it was
3

measured on the interval scale, were proposed by, e.g., Goodman (1972), Sobel (1981), Hope
(1982), Agresti (1983), Hauser (1984). These models assume, for social statuses numbered
from 1 to L, that the distance between categories l1 and l2 is the same as between categories
l3 and l4 (1 ≤ l1 , l2 , l3 , l4 ≤ L), if |l1 − l2 | = |l3 − l4 |.
Comparative mobility research concentrates on revealing changes in social mobility across
years or between countries and is based on analyzing the relative mobility rates, or patterns
of the association between Father’s and Son’s status in several social mobility tables.
The model of conditional independence of Father’s and Son’s status given Year (Y )
assumes that there is no association between Father’s and Son’s status within each year:
log pijk = λ + λFi + λSj + λYk + λFikY + λSY
jk .

(3)

Under the model of common (or constant) social fluidity (CSF), see Erikson & Goldthorpe
(1992), the association between Father’s and Son’s status is allowed to exist and be different
in every cell, but is assumed to be identical for each year (no second order association between
F , S, and Y ):
FS
log pijk = λ + λFi + λSj + λYk + λFikY + λSY
jk + λij .

(4)

If, instead of the λFijS term, Hauser’s levels are allowed, the model of constant pattern of
fluidity (Erikson et al., 1982) is obtained.
A generalization of this model is the UNIDIFF (uniform difference) model (Erikson &
Goldthorpe, 1992), also called the log-multiplicative layer effect model (Xie, 1992):
log pijk = λ + λFi + λSj + λYk + λFikY + λSY
jk + ψij φk .

(5)

Under this model, the F × S × Y association is separated into the F × S and Y components.
The relative strength of the F × S association in year k is expressed by the parameters φk ,
for k = 1, . . . , K. Depending on the constraints placed on the parameters ψij and φk , this
model can be just a reparameterization of the CSF model or can lead to some other models
for mobility tables (Xie, 1992). A UNIDIFF model is used to test whether the odds ratios
in the kth year are uniformly higher or uniformly lower than the odds ratios in the reference
year. However, there are cases when the pattern of mobility does not change as specified by
a UNIDIFF model (cf. Wong, 1994).
This paper offers an approach that is based on the relational model framework, recently
proposed by Klimova et al. (2012). This approach is a generalization of the levels model
framework (Hauser, 1978), is not data driven, and allows for semi-parametric modeling of
change in the mobility pattern. Under the relational models of mobility described in this
paper (see Section 3), the cell frequencies arise as the products of effects associated with
the marginal distributions and also with subsets of cells exhibiting the same level of social
mobility.

Data and Previous Analyses

The analysis in this paper is based on the two data sets that were also analyzed in “Trends
in intergenerational class mobility in modern Britain: evidence from national surveys, 1972–
2005” (Goldthorpe & Mills, 2008), referred to as TICM in the sequel, and “Is social mobility
really declining?” (Devine & Li, 2011), referred to as SMD. Both TICM and SMD relied on
the British Household Panel Survey (1991) and the General Household Survey (2005). The
mobility tables used by TICM and SMD are based on seven categories of class positions:
1. Higher managerial and professional; 2. Lower managerial and professional; 3. Intermediate
occupations (clerical, sales, service); 4. Small employers and own account workers; 5. Lower
supervisory and technical; 6. Semi-routine; 7. Routine. Although the authors of SDM aimed
to reproduce and expand the analyses described in TICM for the two surveys, they used
somewhat different procedures to derive the occupational statuses from the survey data.
Consequently, the results in TICM and SDM are not the same. For example, while TICM
reports almost identical rates of the upward mobility for men in 1991 and 2005, SDM detects
a significant decrease in upward mobility and a significant increase in downward mobility
for men. The comparison of the fit statistics obtained in these papers is given in Table 1.
Despite the differences, both papers conclude that association between Father’s and Son’s
positions was decreasing, that is social fluidity for men was increasing.
The percentage data obtained in SDM for male respondents of age 25-59, transformed to
frequencies and given in Table 2, are used for the analysis in this paper.

A relational model RM (U) (Klimova et al., 2012) with the model matrix A is the following
subset of P:
RM (U) = {p ∈ P : log p = A0 β, for some β ∈ RS }.
Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the model matrix A is of full row rank.
The kernel of the model matrix Ker(A) = {γ ∈ RT : Aγ = 0} is a linear subspace. A
matrix D with rows that form a basis of Ker(A) is called a kernel basis matrix of RM (U) and
can be chosen to have integer entries (Klimova et al., 2012, Theorem 2.2). The distribution
p belongs to the relational model RM (U) if and only if
Dlog p = 0.

Relational models generalize, among others, the quasi models (Goodman, 1968, 1972),
topological models (Hauser, 1978; Hout, 1983), indicator models (Zelterman & Youn, 1992).
In the remainder of this section, two relational models for the comparative analysis of
mobility tables will be described. The model (3) of conditional independence of Father’s
6

and Son’s status given Year will be used as the baseline model. This model assumes that,
within a given year, Father’s and Son’s effects are independent from each other and thus the
relative rates of mobility are equal to 1. Since this model doesn’t fit the data (see Table 1),
further, mobility-related, effects are included.
The relational models will be generated by the cylinder subsets associated with the F ×Y
effect and S × Y effect and additional subsets, called mobility bands. A mobility band is a
collection of those cells that represent the same number and direction of steps from Father’s
position to Son’s position within each year. Each diagonal cell has its own effect, so that
model fit is not influenced by immobile cells. The definition of mobility related subsets Uh is
given in Table 3, where cells belonging to the same subset are marked with the same number.

Under the model Mdif f , the mobility effects are allowed to be different for the two years.
The fit of this model will be compared with that of the model Msame . Under the model
Msame , the mobility effects are supposed to be the same for the two years. The definition of

Both models include the overall effect, expressed by the parameter λ0 , and hence are
regular exponential families (Klimova et al., 2012, Theorem 3.2). The maximum likelihood
(ML) estimates of cell frequencies under these models exist and are unique (cf. BarndorffNielsen, 1978).
The ML estimates of the cell frequencies can be obtained using an iterative proportional
fitting (IPF) procedure that starts with a distribution in the model and adjusts the subset
sums to their observed values. Let RM (U) be a relational model with the overall effect,
ˆ = {ˆ
y = {y(t)} be the observed frequency distribution, and y
y (t)} denote the MLE of y
under the model.

The data used in this analysis were assembled from two independent surveys, and thus
product-multinomial sampling is a better approximation of reality than multinomial sampling. Asymptotic standard errors for log-linear models under the product-multinomial
sampling scheme were obtained by Lang (1996). Although the relational models for mobility tables described in this paper are more general than log-linear models, the derivation
techniques originally proposed by Aitchinson & Silvey (1958) apply. If A and D stand,
respectively, for the model matrix and a kernel basis matrix of Mdif f , then the estimate of

Results

The fit statistics and p-values for the models Msame and Mdif f are given in Table 5. The
model Msame does not fit well and, thus, the data provide some evidence that the pattern of
mobility changed between the two timepoints. Parameter estimates from the model Mdif f
will be used to describe these changes.

The ML estimates, under the model Mdif f , for the mobility effects (on the multiplicative
scale), their ratios, and the applicable standard errors are shown in Table 6 1 . The effects
are centered around 1 on both sides of the main diagonal by assumption (10). The standard
errors for the mobility effects were computed from (11), and the standard errors for the ratios
were obtained using the delta method.
The estimated mobility effects for both years versus the number of steps up or down from
the origin are displayed in Figure 1. The plot indicates that mobility decreases monotonically
as the number of steps from the origin increases. Therefore, moving a small number of steps
up or down compared to the origin seems to be easier than making larger steps. For 1991,
the plot is remarkably symmetric (the effects depend very little on direction), less so in 2005.
In 2005, small moves (1-3 steps) appear to be less likely than in 1991, and for 5 out of these
6 levels the changes are statistically significant at the 95% level. For 4 steps of mobility, the
chances in the two years are virtually identical. Large moves (5-6 steps) appear to be slightly
more likely in 2005 than in 1991, but the increase is not statistically significant (see Table
6). However, this lack of significance does not occur because of smaller estimated effect sizes
for increased chances of more steps of mobility in 2005 compared to 1991, rather because of
larger estimated standard errors for these quantities.

Parameter estimation for relational models that contain the overall effect, like Mdif f , can be performed
using the gnm() function in the R package. However, for the models proposed in this paper, the gnm()
results have shown some instability, and the authors used their own code, which is available upon request.

Figure 1: Estimated mobility effects under Mdif f .
The analyses based on the relational models described in this paper offer a number of
advantages in comparative mobility research. The proposed models also include mobility
effects that are not associated with variables or groups of variables in the table. An F × S
interaction is not assumed beyond the one associated with having made a certain number
of steps up or down, and a finer analysis of the changing mobility patterns is possible. The
mobility effect in the model Mdif f is not assumed to be a linear or some other parametric
function of the F × S interaction and is therefore modeled in a semi-parametric way. This
makes it possible to analyze different numbers and directions of steps independently of
each other, revealing effects when change is statistically significant for some levels but not
significant for others.
