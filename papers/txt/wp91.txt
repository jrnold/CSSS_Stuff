Abstract
In this paper we explore the circumstances under which settlement processes lead to segregation through simulations of an artificial urban residential system with two racial/ethnic
groups, using a recently developed statistical framework for modeling systems with complex dependencies (Butts, 2007). The study differs from previous research most importantly
because it distinguish between in-group and out-group effects, through which we model
the tendency for households to live close to, or far from, members of the same, or of a
different, ethnic group. Previous studies using this modeling framework have shown that
distinguishing between in-group preference (homophily) and out-group avoidance (xenophobia) is important, because the two mechanisms have different implications for the distribution of households across neighborhoods, and interact in non-trivial ways with other effects.
Although this distinction has been employed by some researchers, the majority of recent
residential segregation simulation studies employ the approach of Schelling (1971), which is
based on neighborhood ethnic composition thresholds. We show here that homophily and
xenophobia have the biggest segregating effect on residential systems when acting together.
However, spatial residential patterns differ depending on whether one or both ethnic groups
are homophilous, and the influence of homophily can be countered by even slight tendencies
toward integration. The influence of xenophobia, on the other hand, is more pervasive, and
can only be mitigated by equal or higher levels of in-group avoidance. Since high levels of
in-group avoidance are likely to occur only in special circumstances, these results suggest
that xenophobia may be the more important driver of segregation in most American settings,
and that reducing xenophobia and encouraging integration is a more effective policy lever
than reducing homophily.

Introduction

Ethnic residential segregation, understood broadly as the differential distribution of ethnic
groups across space, is a visible aspect of present day life in metropolitan America that
has long-lasting consequences for the life chances of individuals, primarily minority group
members, living in segregated neighborhoods (Massey and Denton, 1993; Charles, 2003;
Fischer and Tienda, 2006). As Fischer and Tienda (2006, p.101) note, “residential location
is a powerful indicator of social position because many economic opportunities and social
resources, such as affordable housing, quality schools, public safety, transportation, and
recreational and social amenities are unequally distributed across space.”
In this paper we explore the circumstances under which settlement processes lead to segregation through simulations of an artificial urban residential system with two racial/ethnic
groups, using a recently developed statistical framework for modeling systems with complex
dependencies (Butts, 2007). The study differs from previous research in several important
ways. First, we are able to simulate a system that is more realistic, by incorporating characteristics of households as well as characteristics of and relationships among neighborhoods
(such as contiguity). Second, due to the flexibility of the statistical framework employed,
we are able to incorporate a larger number of effects in the model and show how residential
patterns are affected by the interaction among these effects. Third, and most important, we
distinguish between in-group and out-group effects, through which we model the tendency
for households to live close to, or far from, members of the same, or of a different, ethnic
group.
Previous studies using this modeling framework have shown that distinguishing between
in-group preference (homophily) and out-group avoidance (xenophobia) is important, because the two mechanisms have different implications for the distribution of households
across neighborhoods, and interact in non-trivial ways with other effects (Petrescu-Prahova,
2007). Although this distinction has been employed by Sakoda (1971) and Benenson (2004),
the majority of recent residential segregation simulation studies employ the approach of
Schelling (1971), which is based on neighborhood ethnic composition thresholds (Zhang,
2004b; Fossett, 2006; Bruch and Mare, 2006). This tendency can be explained in part by
the nature of preference studies, which place greater emphasis on attitudes toward the percentage of various groups in neighborhoods, and less on whether these attitudes are linked
to homophily or xenophobia. Other studies simply assume that the presence of in-group
preference necessarily implies out-group avoidance, which need not be the case (Hwang and
Murdock, 1998).
We show here that homophily and xenophobia have the biggest segregating effect on resi-

1

dential systems when acting together. However, spatial residential patterns differ depending
on whether one or both ethnic groups are homophilous, and the influence of homophily can
be countered by even slight tendencies toward integration. The influence of xenophobia, on
the other hand, is more pervasive, and can only be mitigated by equal or higher levels of
in-group avoidance. Since high levels of in-group avoidance are likely to occur only in special circumstances, these results suggest that xenophobia may be the more important driver
of segregation in most American settings, and that reducing xenophobia and encouraging
integration is a more effective policy lever than reducing homophily.
In the following sections we review the literature on the determinants of ethnic residential
segregation and of simulation studies that seek to explore the ways in which household preferences for neighborhood composition and economic characteristics interact to produce spatial
patterns (mainly using agent-based models). We then introduce the modeling framework
employed in the study and present results of simulations of an artificial urban residential
system. The paper concludes with a review of findings and policy implications.

1.1

Potential Determinants of Residential Segregation

Ethnic residential segregation has been a visible and salient aspect of urban life in the United
States, especially after the country experienced massive waves of immigration during the 19th
and early 20th centuries. Previous studies of residential segregation (Clark, 1992; Massey and
Denton, 1993; Charles, 2003; Alba and Nee, 2003; Chung and Brown, 2007) suggest several
factors as potential determinants of the phenomenon, which can be classified into four main
categories: demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, preferences for neighborhood
composition, institutional and political factors such as discriminatory practices and housing
policies, and physical characteristics of the urban environment.
Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. One of the most important set of factors affecting residential settlement patterns are individual and aggregate socioeconomic
characteristics, especially household income and neighborhood rent levels. The relationship
between rent and income is a hard constraint on residential choice, especially for low-income
households, who tend not to move into housing above a certain price (Bruch, 2006, p.186).
As a consequence, households with comparable incomes seek locations with similar and affordable rent levels and therefore cluster together in certain parts of the metropolis (Hawley,
1950). Another process through which the sorting of households to neighborhoods takes
place is the so-called “Tiebout mechanism” (Tiebout, 1956; Wassmer, 2005): people with
very similar demands for the local public good choose to live in the same community, which
leads to “more homogeneously higher income, higher class, and higher public good providing communities, and also more homogeneously lower-income, lower class, and lower public
2

good-providing communities” (Wassmer, 2005, p.167). If, in addition, we take into account
the fact that poverty disproportionately affects members of minority ethnic groups, we have
the premises of ethnic residential segregation through income levels alone (Clark, 1986b;
Gottdiener and Hutchison, 2000).
On the other hand, settlement patterns in urban areas are also determined by social
networks of kinship, friendship, and co-ethnicity. To a large extent, these networks offer
support to new immigrants, who are unfamiliar with American society and often lack proficiency in English (Bean and Stevens, 2005). This leads to geographic concentration of ethnic
or even national origin groups (Thomas, 1921; Massey et al., 1998; Menj´ıvar, 2000). This
phenomenon is not restricted to immigrants, however; human geography studies suggest that
internal migrants also make settlement decisions based on the geographic location of friends
and relatives (Clark, 1986a).
One of the most influential theories for the interpretation of ethnic population distribution across metropolitan space is the spatial assimilation framework (Massey and Denton,
1985). According to this framework, immigrant groups initially settle in enclaves located in
the inner city, mainly in economically disadvantaged areas. As their members experience
social mobility and acculturation, they usually leave these areas and move to areas that do
not have such a high concentration of ethnic minorities, leading to a reduction in residential segregation levels. Therefore, the underlying assumptions of this framework are that
neighborhood location and housing are largely determined by market processes and that
individuals are motivated to improve their residential status once they have acculturated
and made some socioeconomic gains.
Preferences for neighborhood composition. A series of studies conducted first in Detroit
and then in other cities (Farley et al., 1978; 1997; Charles, 2001) have provided evidence about
the preferences for neighborhood ethnic composition of members of various racial/ethnic
groups.
Charles (2003) summarizes these studies conducted first only for blacks and whites (Farley
et al., 1978) and then extended to include other minority groups (Farley et al., 1997) and
notes that
“all groups exhibit preferences for both meaningful integration and a substantial
presence of same-race neighbors, although preferences for same-race neighbors
are not uniform across groups: whites exhibit the strongest preference for samerace neighbors and blacks the weakest. Moreover, preferences vary by the race of
the target group and demonstrate a racial rank ordering of out-groups in which
white are always the most desirable out-group and blacks are always the least
desirable. Finally, preferences for integration decline as the number of out-group
3

members increases” (Charles, 2003, p.185).
For the purpose of understanding how these preferences might influence residential patterns, it is also useful to examine the reasons respondents give for why they would like to
move to or out of neighborhoods of certain compositions. Detailed analyses of MCSUI data
show a mixed picture of the reasons behind neighborhood preferences: whites who say they
would flee integrating neighborhoods do so to avoid blacks, not to be together with other
whites (Charles, 2003), but at the same time whites’ preferences for living in white neighborhoods play a role in the racial composition of neighborhoods chosen by whites (Ihlanfeldt
and Scafidi, 2004). On the other hand, blacks and other minorities show a desire for strong
co-ethnic presence as well as a desire for integration, and Ihlanfeldt and Scafidi (2002) find
that “black self-segregation plays a statistically significant, albeit minor role in explaining
housing segregation.”
Preference research offers important insights into the processes that underlie residential
decision-making, but has the shortcoming that it only takes into account stated preferences
and it is not clear if and how these preferences translate into residential decisions. In addition,
preferences may be influenced by other factors such as discrimination, making it difficult to
accept the claim that they may be solely responsible for existing levels of segregation (Fossett,
2006; Goering, 2006).
Discrimination. In addition to influencing personal residential choices, neighborhood
composition preferences are important because they may lead to discrimination, for instance
through restrictive covenants signed by neighborhood associations, which limit the choices
available to minority groups and in the past led to the creation of segregated neighborhoods
(Massey and Denton, 1993). Although these extreme, formally implemented, measures are
now illegal, more subtle practices such as personal discrimination by real estate agents persist
but are harder to identify and eradicate (Galster, 1992). A recent audit study conducted
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 2000 (Turner et al.,
2002) shows that there have been modest declines in discrimination between 1989-2000.
However, whites were still more favorably treated than blacks in 17% of sale and 22% of
rental audits. Latino and Asian testers experienced adverse treatment in almost one out of
four housing searches (both rental and sales), and the major obstacle was inferior assistance
with financing compared with white testers.
Housing policies. Recognizing the consequences of segregation, urban decision makers
have adopted or proposed a number of policies aimed at reducing segregation (Briggs, 2005).
Such strategies target three main areas: income stratification, preferences and choice, and
discrimination. They include housing subsidies, mixed-income housing development, relocation counseling and scattered-site public housing. Some of these strategies have already
4

been implemented in the United States and Europe (Varady, 2005; Musterd and Andersson, 2005), showing marginal improvements for the lower-income households involved. On
the other hand, some policies, such as the project-linked capital subsidy system for home
ownership implemented in South Africa, only served to institutionalize the preservation of
segregation (Huchzermeyer, 2005).
Physical characteristics of the urban environment. Modern cities have certain man-made
features, which are intrinsic to their structure and to some extent independent of their
resident population, as well as natural features, all of which may be conducive to certain
patterns of land use (McKenzie, 1924; Hawley, 1950). Fixed infrastructure (e.g., roads,
factories), the spatial distribution of land available for residential use (as opposed to economic
use), and the number of housing units, combined with natural barriers such as rivers or hills
can influence settlement patterns (Grannis, 1998; Foner, 2000). For instance, locations which
present spatially isolated clusters of housing units may be more prone to segregation than
locations with minimal barriers between units.
Based on the above, we can summarize a number of mechanisms that are basic to residential settlement in residential systems with two or more ethnic groups:
• Households choose housing units based on their affordability
• Households choose housing units based on the ethnic composition of the neighborhood,
and try to locate close to other households of the same race/ethnicity (sometimes
referred to as “in-group preference” or “ethnocentrism”)
• Households choose housing units based on the ethnic composition of the neighborhood,
and try to locate far from other households of different race/ethnicity (usually referred
to as “out-group avoidance”)
• Minority households choose housing units based on the ethnic composition of the neighborhood, and try to locate close to non-Hispanic white households (this would be an
indication of spatial assimilation; the process takes place mainly because minority
households associate these neighborhoods with higher status, lower crime, or better
services)
• Households of certain ethnicities are prevented from entering neighborhoods in which
another group is in the majority (discrimination)
• Households choose housing units located relatively close to friends and kin
• Households choose housing units based on housing density: households have preferences
for neighborhood density that vary at different stages in the life cycle (Clark, 1986a).
5

Households with small children may prefer low-density, suburban neighborhoods, while
single adult households may prefer high-density central city living
• Households choose housing units across communities offering different public goods
packages that are excludable on the basis of location.
Despite the wealth of empirical studies that consider these mechanisms as potential determinants of residential segregation, the manner in which spatial residential patterns emerge
from their interaction is not widely understood. Important steps in this direction have been
made by researchers using agent-based and cellular automata models (Schelling, 1969; 1971;
Epstein and Axtell, 1996; Mare and Bruch, 2003; Benenson, 2004; Zhang, 2004a; Fossett,
2006). However, the majority of these studies do not adequately distinguish between various
mechanisms such as in-group preference or out-group avoidance.
In the following sections we summarize previous approaches that have been employed in
the exploration of the mechanisms of residential settlement and segregation, and then briefly
describe the approach that we use in this study. We then present results of simulations of a
simple artificial urban system (computational experiments).

1.2

Agent Based Models

Most sociological literature is based on an understanding of society as a system of institutions
and norms that shape individual behavior from the top down. However, the growing body of
research in residential segregation that uses agent based models “reflects growing interest in
the possibility that human groups [...] may be highly complex, nonlinear, path-dependent,
and self-organizing. We may be able to understand these dynamics much better by trying to
model them, not at the global level but instead as emergent properties of local interaction
among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive”
(Macy and Willer, 2002, p.144).
Research employing agent based models (ABMs) provides very general and simplified
models of interaction among social actors, and has been quite successful in developing intuitions about the types of outcomes that may result from these interactions. When studying
residential segregation, researchers usually simulate scenarios in which multiple agents, most
often belonging to two racial/ethnic groups, make residential location decisions based on
their preferences and resources; the resulting spatial residential patterns are then examined
for the presence of segregation. Agent-based model research has illustrated the manner in
which factors such as neighborhood composition preferences and socioeconomic characteristics together influence spatial residential patterns (Schelling, 1969; 1971; Sakoda, 1971;

6

Epstein and Axtell, 1996; Hegselmann and Flache, 1998; Mare and Bruch, 2003; Benenson,
2004; Zhang, 2004a; Fossett, 2006).
The setup and rules of most agent-based modeling in segregation research is based on
early work by Schelling (1971). In his model two classes of agents interact on an 8x8 grid
of cells1 . Agents are initially randomly distributed across the cells. Then they examine
their 3x3 Moore neighborhood and migrate to the closest free cell if the number of agents of
the other class in their neighborhood is higher that a certain threshold (50% for instance).
Schelling showed that populations can reach high levels of segregation even when agents are
willing to live in neighborhoods where they are in the minority.
Several researchers have extended the original Schelling model, by relaxing some of its
assumptions and adding various levels of complexity. For instance, Laurie and Jaggi (2003)
investigate the role of agent “vision” in the dynamics of Schelling’s model by letting agents
consider larger neighborhoods when making a decision to move. They show that the farther
agents can “see” in their environment, the more segregated the resulting spatial patterns.
Zhang (2004b) employs a stochastic game-theoretic approach to show that segregation is a
stochastically stable state and that it emerges even if blacks are color neutral and whites
have only a slight preference for like-colored neighbors. Bruch and Mare (2006) relax the
original Schelling assumption that agents only move to neighborhoods that have at least
50% same group agents, instead allowing agents to make finer-grained distinctions among
neighborhoods that vary in racial composition. Their simulations lead to much lower levels
of segregation, suggesting that preferences alone may not be sufficient to explain segregation.
On the other hand, Fossett (2006) shows that, even in the absence of discrimination, “ethnic
preferences and social distance dynamics can, when combined with status preferences, status dynamics, and demographic and urban-structural settings common in American cities,
produce highly stable patterns of multi-group segregation and hyper-segregation (i.e., high
levels of ethnic segregation on multiple dimensions) of minority populations” (p. 185).
In terms of preferences, most agent-based model studies of residential segregation have
used and extended Schelling’s model, in which agents react to the fraction of familiar agents
within the neighborhood (i.e., a threshold). The alternative, proposed by James Sakoda
(1971) and published in the same issue of the Journal of Mathematical Sociology as Schelling’s
study, has received much less attention in the modeling literature (Hegselmann and Flache,
1998; Benenson, 2004).
The setup and rules of the model are as follows (Sakoda, 1971, p.123): An 8x8 checkerboard represents the field of social interaction, two sets of six agents each are used, repre1

In his first paper on the subject, Schelling’s agents are assumed to live on a line and their neighborhood
is represented just by the agents to the left and right.

sented by Squares and Crosses, and the starting positions on the board are determined by
a random allocation process. Each square on the checkerboard can only be occupied by one
agent at the time (a 1-to-1 occupancy constraint), and the center of the board represents a
more attractive place than the margins. Each agent is assigned an attitude of attraction,
neutrality, or avoidance toward members of her own and the other group, denoted by the
values -1, 0, and +1. The choice of a move is determined by the sum of the attitudes towards
the agent’s neighbors and distance. Sakoda (1971) describes several scenarios determined by
the combination of these attitudes, but for the purposes of the model’s potential application
to residential segregation three of them are more informative, namely the ones Sakoda refers
to as “Crossroads,” “Mutual Suspicion,” and “Segregation.”
1. “Crossroads”: In this version, agents are attracted to members of their own group, but
neutral toward members of the other group. At the end of the simulation the agents
separate into two groups according to their type, sitting side by side near the center
of the board. Since the center of the board is a more attractive place for everyone,
agents tend to converge there; however, due to the fact that they are also attracted
to members of their own group, they coalesce on the basis of their type. Note that
they do not separate - the fact that they occupy two different but adjacent areas of
the board is a result of the 1-to-1 occupancy constraint of the model.
2. “Mutual Suspicion”: Here, agents avoid representatives of the other group but are
neutral to agents of their own type. At the end of the simulation the two groups have
separated and moved into opposing corners, based on the desire to be as far away from
each other as possible.
3. “Segregation”: In this version of the model, agents avoid representatives of the unfamiliar group and are attracted to agents of their own type. The results are similar to
the “Mutual Suspicion” scenario in that the two groups end up occupying opposing
corners of the checkerboard, but they differ on one important aspect: the two groups
are now a lot more cohesive and tend to form well defined clusters.
Sakoda’s model (1971) displays the same elegance and simplicity as Schelling’s (1971)
but offers a more nuanced analysis of the effects of preferences on residential patterns by
clearly distinguishing between attraction, neutrality, and avoidance. In Schelling’s model,
the preference for a majority own-group neighborhood can be interpreted as both a desire
to live with own-group members and a desire not to live close to members of the other
group. In this paper we distinguish between in-group preference (“homophily”), neutrality
and out-group avoidance (“xenophobia”) in a manner similar to Sakoda’s (1971), while also
8

examining the role of the complementary mechanisms of in-group avoidance and out-group
preference. This approach is facilitated by the use of the location system modeling framework
(Butts, 2007), which is summarized in the following section.

2

The Location System Model

A residential system contains various kinds of dependencies: households are tied to one
another by kin or friendship relations, and neighborhoods are related by virtue of being
contiguous or being a certain distance apart from one another. One area of sociology that
has seen tremendous advances toward developing stochastic models for social systems with
complex dependence structures is social network analysis, where researchers have drawn
on earlier results in other scientific fields such as spatial statistics and statistical physics
(Robins and Pattison, 2005) to build models to account for such complex dependencies.
Building further on these developments, Butts (2007) has proposed “a general framework
for modeling and analysis of systems which can be specified in terms of the arrangement of
a finite set of objects with respect to a finite set of locations” (p. 285). This framework can
be used to study a range of social processes such as occupational segregation, stratification
and settlement patterns.
The main premise of the approach, as applied to residential settlement, is that at any
point in time, we can interpret spatial residential patterns as an equilibrium state of a
residential system. The fact that the residential system is in equilibrium can be interpreted
in the sense that the system’s current behavior is free of large external perturbations and that
the mechanisms underlying the system’s current behavior are stable. A state of equilibrium
does not imply that the system does not change, but rather that the system has adapted to
major perturbations and their effects have been erased by the passage of time.

2

In the generalized location system framework social phenomena are described in terms
of the arrangement of objects with respect to a set of locations. In our application of
the location system model to study residential settlement we assume that households are
the locus of decision making in the mobility process and that they consider moving to
neighborhoods, treating all housing units within a neighborhood as equal. In other words,
we take households to be the objects and neighborhoods to be the locations.
A particular assignment of households to neighborhoods (such as the one we observe in
a metropolitan area) represents a configuration of the residential system, and the possible
configurations of the system will depend on the constraints of the system, most notably on
2

This assumption would not hold in extreme cases such as a refugee crisis or a major natural disaster
such as Hurricane Katrina, which displace large numbers of people or may render large parts of the housing
stock uninhabitable.

occupancy constraints that limit the number of households that can be found in various
neighborhoods.
Let C be the set of all possible system configurations. Given C, the system will be found
to occupy any particular configuration with some specified probability. The probability that
at equilibrium the system will be found in a given configuration l can be written as
Pr(S = l) = IC (l) P

exp(P(l))
0
l0 ∈C exp(P(l ))

(1)

where S is the equilibrium state, l is the given configuration (i.e., a certain assignment
of households to neighborhoods), and IC (l) is an indicator function that takes a value of 1
if l ∈ C and 0 if l ∈
/ C. P is a quantity called the social potential, through which the social
mechanisms that are believed to have led the system to its current state are included in the
model.
The residential system is more likely to be found in areas of high probability which, as
can be seen from equation 1, are also areas of high potential (since the probability is directly
proportional to the social potential). In other words, the system is more likely to be found to
occupy configurations that maximize the social potential. When specifying the form of the
social potential function, it should be born in mind that a residential system configuration
represents the assignment of certain households to certain neighborhoods. As a consequence,
the social potential function should include effects that reflect this assignment, and take into
account household and neighborhood characteristics at the same time. Butts (2007) specifies
a linear functional form for the social potential, one that is based on household attributes
and relations among households, as well as on neighborhood attributes and relations among
neighborhoods. Table 1 provides a few examples of what these attributes and relations may
be for a residential system.
Each of the terms in the social potential function involves an interaction between the
attributes or relations of households and the attributes or relations of the neighborhoods
10

in which they reside. The social potential is then constructed as a linear function of these
effects, and has the following expression:

where α,β,γ, and δ are parameter vectors, X and Y are matrices of household attributes,
Q and R are matrices of neighborhood attributes, B and D are arrays of neighborhood relation adjacency matrices, and A and W are arrays of household relation adjacency matrices.
Each of the terms in the social potential function thus involves an interaction between the
attributes or relations of households and the attributes or relations of the neighborhoods in
which they reside. Table 2 presents examples of effects that can be included when modeling
a residential system of households and neighborhoods.

3

The generalized location system framework can be readily simulated. This is done via
the Metropolis algorithm, which takes as its starting point a random assignment of households to neighborhoods, l(i) ∈ C and then proposes to move a household from its existing
neighborhood to a new one, thus proposing a new assignment l(i+1) . If the value of the social
potential function increases, the move is accepted, and the process is repeated by proposing
a new move. If the value of the social potential function decreases, the move is accepted
(i+1) |P,C)
with probability p = min(1, PPr(S=l
), and then the process is repeated by proposing
r(S=l(i) |P,C)
a new move. If the move is rejected, then the system remains in its current state and a new
move is proposed.4
By specifying values of the parameters in a simulated scenario, we obtain assignments of
households to neighborhoods that illustrate what the spatial patterns would be if particular
social mechanisms were at play. In the following section we present results of computational
experiments based on simulations of an artificial urban residential system.

Simulation of a Simple Artificial Urban System

Although not an agent based model per se, the location system model can be used to conduct
computational experiments that are similar in their goals to the ones of ABMs - namely, to
provide, by means of simulation, an insight into the global spatial patterns that emerge
as a result of interactions at the micro level. The simulation of a simple scenario with a

small population and few effects allows us to investigate the residential settlement patterns
that result from the interaction of various mechanisms of interest. This section builds on
the example given in Butts (2007) for the application of the location system framework
for modeling residential settlement. We use the same basic scenario, but include additional
effects and measure the levels of segregation in resulting simulated residential configurations.
We begin by describing the simple system used in the simulation, then present the effects
that are going to be included in the model, and then conduct computational experiments
that examine the behavior of the system over a range of parameter values.

3.1

The Artificial Urban System and Model Specification

The system employed in this analysis is composed of 1000 households that are allocated to
400 neighborhoods, which are represented by squares in a 20 x 20 grid. Each household
has one of two types of ethnicity, which is randomly assigned in equal proportions (500
households belong to each type), and is given a random income (drawn independently from
a log-normal distribution with parameters 10 and 1.5). Each neighborhood is assigned a
rent value which scales with the inverse of the distance between its centroid and the center
of the grid (i.e., rent levels are highest at the center of the grid). Neighborhoods have equal
area and relationships among them are expressed in terms of Queen’s contiguity (i.e., two
neighborhoods are considered contiguous if they share a border or a point).
The model specifications used here include the following effects:
• Attraction: based on household income and neighborhood rent. The sufficient statistic associated with this effect is maximized when all households live in the highest
rent neighborhoods. A positive attraction parameter would lead to households being attracted by high rent neighborhoods, while a negative parameter would led to
households being repelled by high rent neighborhoods.
• Out-group effect: based on household race/ethnicity and neighborhood contiguity.
This effect quantifies the tendency for households of different ethnicities to reside in
non-contiguous neighborhoods. If the associated parameter is negative, this effect is
maximized when the associated statistic is 0, which means that ethnically different
households live in neighborhoods that are not contiguous. This would be an indication
of out-group avoidance, or xenophobia5 . If the associated parameter is positive, this
effect is maximized when the associated statistic is also maximized, which means that

• In-group effect: based on household similarity in race/ethnicity and neighborhood contiguity. This effect quantifies the tendency for households that are ethnically similar
to reside in neighborhoods that are contiguous. If the associated parameter is positive,
this effect is maximized when the associated statistic is maximized, which means that
ethnically similar households tend to live in neighborhoods that are contiguous. This
would be an indication of in-group preference, or homophily. If the associated parameter is negative, this effect is maximized when the associated statistic is 0, which means
that ethnically similar households tend to live in neighborhoods that are not contiguous. This would be an indication of in-group avoidance, or fragmentation. Such
a scenario may be motivated by national origin differences within all-encompassing
groups such as “Hispanic” or “Asian.” In a scenario with two ethnic groups, we can
distinguish between
– A differential in-group effect, where the tendencies exhibited by the two groups
are different; here we use a special case where we only model the tendency of
members of one ethnic group to reside close to or far from each other, and assume
that members of the other group are indifferent toward each other, and
– A uniform in-group effect, where we model the tendency of members of both
ethnic groups to reside close to or far from each other, but assume that they are
equal
• Density: based on total population counts in neighborhoods. The sufficient statistic
associated with this effect is calculated as a sum of the squared population counts in
each neighborhood, and the statistic is maximized when all households are assigned to
the same neighborhood. If the parameter is positive, this effect captures the tendency
for households to reside in proximity to other households. If the parameter is negative,
clustering in any one neighborhood decreases the value of the social potential function,
and therefore in order to obtain high values of the social potential function households
are dispersed across neighborhoods.
Our principal focus in this analysis is on in-group and out-group effects and so comparisons are drawn mainly between various model specifications that include these effects. In

Note that even though at the preference and behavioral level we can distinguish between two processes
of avoidance (for instance, blacks avoid whites and whites avoid blacks), at the spatial level we can only
ascertain the extent to which the 2 groups are separated from one another.

order to characterize and compare the assignments we use residential segregation indices.
Earlier studies using this framework also included a propinquity effect that captured the
tendency for households that were linked via social ties to live in neighborhoods that were
close to one another (Butts, 2007; Petrescu-Prahova, 2007). However, since the addition of
the propinquity effect did not change the results substantially, it will not be examined here.

3.2

Computational Experiments

We are interested here in the way in which the distribution of households to neighborhoods
varies with changes in parameter values, especially for in-group and out-group effects. To
explore this issue we set up a series of computational experiments in which attraction and
density parameters are kept constant at either 0 or the fixed values of 0.000075 and -0.01, respectively, while out-group and in-group parameters vary between -0.2 and 0.2, and calculate
segregation indices for the simulated configurations. Plotting the values of the indices for the
simulated residential configurations resulting from varying the values of the parameters may
suggest the existence of various “regimes,” areas of the parameter space where the system
becomes locked into configurations with certain characteristics.
We use here two segregation indices: the dissimilarity index and the spatial proximity
index. The dissimilarity index, D, is one of the most widely used segregation indices. It
measures departure from the even distribution of minority and majority population across
areal units, and can be interpreted as the percentage of a group’s population that would
have to change residence for each neighborhood to have the same percentage of that group
as the urban area overall. The index ranges from 0 (complete integration) to 1 (complete
segregation).
Although most residential segregation indices are based on proportions of minority/majority
population in clearly defined neighborhoods, they do not take into account the location of
these spatial units of measurement relative to each other. Clustering indices address this
shortcoming and measure “the extent to which areal units inhabited by minority members
adjoin one another, or cluster, in space” (Massey and Denton, 1988, p. 293). The spatial
proximity index, SP , is a clustering index that calculates the average of intragroup proximities for the minority and majority populations, weighted by the proportions each group
represents of the total population.
Spatial proximity equals 1 if there is no differential clustering between minority and
majority group members. It is greater than 1 when members of each group live nearer to
one another than to members of the other group (segregation), and is less than 1 if minority
and majority members live nearer to members of the other group than to members of their
own group (supra-random mixing).
15

In the remainder of this section we present results of simulations from models that include
the following four combinations of effects:
1. Out-group and differential in-group effects (Figures 1, 2, 3)
2. Out-group and uniform in-group effects (Figures 4, 5, 6)
3. Attraction, density, out-group and differential in-group effects (Figures 7, 8, 9)
4. Attraction, density, out-group and uniform in-group effects (Figures 10, 11, 12)
For each combination of effects, we present two aggregate plots: the first one shows values
of the spatial proximity index averaged over 1000 residential configurations simulated from
a model including the respective effects, and the second one shows values of the dissimilarity
index averaged over the same 1000 residential configurations7 .
For the figures showing average spatial proximity index levels, values of the index below
1 (corresponding to supra-random mixing) are represented by shades of brown while values
above 1 (corresponding to segregation) are represented by shades of green. For the figures
showing average dissimilarity index values various levels of the index (which takes values
from 0 to 1) are represented by shades of green. To ease the interpretation of these plots, we
divide them into four quadrants, based on the sign of parameter values. In all figures, black
lines have been added to indicate the value of 0. It is useful to remind the reader here that
a positive in-group parameter corresponds to homophily and a negative in-group parameter corresponds to fragmentation, which can be understood in the context where a group
that is homogeneous from a racial/ethnic category point of view separates based on other
characteristics we are not modeling, such as national origin. Similarly, a negative out-group
parameter corresponds to xenophobia, while a positive out-group parameter corresponds to
tendencies for out-group preference, or, more simply, integration. All of these mechanisms
have been documented by empirical research, but the spatial outcomes of their interaction
have not been well understood until now.
We also present, for each combination of effects, four examples of residential configurations that are representative for the various “regimes” we identify in the aggregate plots.
Here, households are represented by black or red circles (according to their ethnicity), whose
diameter scales with income levels (the bigger the diameter, the larger the household income).
Neighborhood boundaries are given by the black lines of the grid, and within-neighborhood
household positions are jittered to prevent overlap.

The simulated configurations are 1000 Metropolis draws uniformly thinned from a total sample of size
1,000,000, with a burn-in of 100,000 draws.

16

Figure 1: Mean SP Values Calculated over 1000 Metropolis Draws from a Model with Outgroup and Differential In-group Effects
We now turn to figures 1, 2 and 3, which are based on system configurations simulated
from a model including out-group and differential in-group effects. We can make several
observations. First, when the assignment of households to neighborhoods is a result of
xenophobia (β < 0) and differential homophily (δ1 > 0) mechanisms, the value of the SP
index is close to 1.9 and of the dissimilarity index close to 1, which indicates very high levels
of segregation. The example panel in the upper left corner of figure 3 shows that this is
indeed the case: the areas occupied by the two groups are separated by an almost empty
band, which is due to the fact that xenophobia is based on the neighborhood contiguity
matrix and therefore direct contact between the two groups is discouraged. In addition,
since black households are homophilous, they cluster together in a few neighborhoods.
The lower left quadrant shows a more mixed picture. This quadrant corresponds to the
situation in which we have a negative out-group parameter β, which indicates xenophobia,
but also a negative in-group parameter δ1 , which indicates in-group avoidance, or fragmentation. Again it is useful to refer to the example panel in figure 3, lower left corner, to
understand the spatial patterns that obtain when these two mechanisms are at play. Black
households avoid each other, and therefore are scattered throughout the landscape. At the
same time, households of both colors tend to be located far from households of the opposite
17

Figure 2: Mean D Values, Calculated over 1000 Metropolis Draws from a Model with Outgroup and Differential In-group Effects
color (xenophobia). The system is not segregated only when the β parameter is small, since
its segregating effect on the system is overturned by the in-group avoidance manifested by
one of the groups. However, as xenophobia increases, the system becomes more segregated.
The upper right quadrant of the plots in figures 1 and 2 shows average values of segregation indices for system configurations simulated from a model with out-group preference
(β > 0) and differential homophily effects (δ1 > 0). This is a situation where households
have a tendency to live close to other households, both from the same and from the other
ethnic group. Not surprisingly, the result is integrated neighborhoods (upper right panel of
figure 3).
The biggest puzzle, however, is the lower right corner of the plots, which corresponds to
residential configurations that result from out-group preference (β > 0)and in-group avoidance mechanisms (δ1 < 0). The two segregation indices we calculate diverge spectacularly
in their evaluation of the configurations: they are supra-randomly mixed according to the
spatial proximity index, but completely segregated according to the dissimilarity index. An
examination of the example panel in figure 3 reveals the origin of this disagreement: when
we have tendencies toward integration as well as internal separation of one of the groups,
the result is a system configuration in which, on average, members of one group live closer

to members of the other group than to members of their own group. Since the dissimilarity
index is based on the ethnic composition of cells, it accurately reflects their ethnic homogeneity. However, since the spatial proximity index takes into account the neighboring cells
as well, it reflects the mixed character of the whole cluster.
Next we examine figures 4, 5 and 6, which are based on system configurations simulated
from a model including out-group and uniform in-group effects. To clarify, here we model
both groups as having the same tendencies for in-group preference (or “uniform homophily”,
δ1 > 0), and in-group avoidance (δ1 < 0). Again, the presence of homophily and xenophobia
mechanisms leads to very segregated configurations, where the two groups are both separated
from each other and clustered in a small number of neighborhoods (figure 6, upper left panel).
Turning to the lower left quadrant of figures 4 and 5, we observe that the in-group avoidance
manifested by both groups cancels out the xenophobia effect, and the system is segregated
very little. As in-group avoidance decreases, segregation increases for areas of the parameter
space where β is larger in absolute value than δ1 .
In a manner similar to differential homophily, uniform homophily by itself can lead to segregation, but even slight tendencies toward integration move the system to a non-segregated
state (upper right quadrant of figures 4, 5, and upper right panel of figure 6). The only situ19

ations in which segregation persists even after integration pressure increases are those where
a critical mass of members of a group are located in a particular area and continue to attract
members of their own group, a situation similar to ethnic enclaves. The presence of outgroup preference, and in-group avoidance manifested by both groups generates a residential
configuration where groups tend to separate in a checkerboard pattern, a configuration that
is identified as supra-randomly mixed by the spatial proximity index (values less than 1),
but as highly segregated by the dissimilarity index. This type of configuration is reminiscent
of present-day Toronto, where groups are segregated at the block or even building level, but
larger areal units such as school districts show high levels of integration (Qadeer, 2005).

Figure 4: Mean SP Values Calculated over 1000 Metropolis Draws from a Model with Outgroup and Uniform In-group Effects
In the next set of figures we examine the residential configurations obtained when varying
in-group and out-group parameters in a model that also includes attraction and density
effects. Figures 7 and 10 show the values of the spatial proximity index averaged over
1000 residential configurations simulated based on a model that includes attraction, density,
out-group and differential in-group effects (Figure 7) and attraction, density, out-group and
uniform in-group effects (Figure 10). Figures 8 and 11 show the average values of the
dissimilarity index calculated for the same residential configurations.
In this case we have a positive attraction parameter, which generates configurations in
20

Figure 5: Mean D Values Calculated over 1000 Metropolis Draws from a Model with Outgroup and Uniform In-group Effects
which high income households are attracted to the center of the grid, and a negative density
parameter, which discourages clustering. Figures 9 and 12 provide example configurations
from the four quadrants of each aggregate plot. These configurations and the overall segregation patterns are similar to the ones obtained by simulating from a model that does not
include attraction and density effects. The main difference is the fact that here households
with higher incomes (illustrated by larger circles) cluster in the center of the grid, where
high rent cells are located.

Conclusions

One of the determinants of residential segregation that has received substantial attention
in the literature is the preference for neighborhood composition: in the process of making
a residential relocation decision, households act upon their preferences for the presence of
in-group or out-group members in the neighborhood. In-group preference (homophily) and
out-group avoidance (xenophobia) are mechanisms that have been identified by researchers
to influence residential patterns but that are rarely treated separately in studies that use
agent-based models to examine emergent settlement patterns, with a few notable exceptions

(β) and Differential In-group (δ1 ) Effects
(Sakoda, 1971; Benenson, 2004). This omission can be explained in part by the nature
of preference studies, which place greater emphasis on attitudes toward the percentage of
various groups in neighborhoods, and less on whether these attitudes are linked to homophily
or xenophobia. However, such a lack of distinction is not desirable, as homophily and
xenophobia shape residential systems in distinct ways: the former is associated with the
clustering of households of the same ethnicity, the latter with the separation in space of
households of different ethnicities. In addition, spatial residential patterns differ depending
on whether one or both ethnic groups are homophilous.
In his presentation of possible alternative scenarios for multiethnic cities, Boal (1999)
proposes the use of a scenario approach to inform policymakers, both by determining which
scenario best fits the current circumstances of a certain area, and by considering its probable
alternative futures. He argues that understanding where a city lies on the scenario continuum
and what it takes to transition to a different scenario has great potential for designing policies
that either keep in check current tendencies or attempt to steer the city in the desired
direction. A similar proposal can be made here. The broader impacts of this research
include its potential to inform policy decisions aimed at reducing segregation. The ability to
examine the consequences of varying parameter values provides an opportunity for examining
22

Figure 7: Mean SP Values Calculated over 1000 Metropolis Draws from a Model with Attraction (α = 0.000075), Density (δ2 = −0.01), Out-group, and Differential In-group Effects
the consequences of public policies and external events for the system.
In this examination of policy implications we need to consider two separate scenarios:
one where each of the two mechanisms act by themselves and one where they act in concert.
If homophily or xenophobia are the only mechanisms at play, the residential system becomes
segregated for lower levels of homophily than it does for xenophobia. When more mechanisms
are at play at the same time, this observation translates into the following result: if homophily
is present, its levels are less important than the way it interacts with the other mechanisms in
the system. In the situation where both homophily and xenophobia are present, the spatial
outcome is very highly segregated. Homophily does not produce segregation in the presence
of even slight tendencies toward integration, with the exception of cases where a critical mass
of members of a group are located in a particular area and continue to attract members of
their own group. These observations hold for both differential and uniform homophily.
We also examine here the consequences that other, less-acknowledged mechanisms, may
have for the spatial patterns of residential systems. Of particular interest are in-group
avoidance (which may be motivated by national origin differences within all-encompassing
groups such as “Hispanic” or “Asian”) and out-group preference (as evinced in a spatial
assimilation scenario). Previous studies have devoted little attention to the way in which
23

Figure 8: Mean D Values Calculated over 1000 Metropolis Draws from a Model with Attraction (α = 0.000075), Density (δ2 = −0.01), Out-group and Differential In-group Effects
these mechanisms influence spatial patterns and, more importantly, how they interact with
other mechanisms. We show that homophily does not produce segregation in the presence of
even slight tendencies to out-group preference (with the exception of the ethnic enclave-type
scenario described above), and that the effects of xenophobia can be mitigated by equal or
higher levels of in-group avoidance, which is unlikely in most contemporary U.S. settings.
Reducing the levels of xenophobia has implications for the level of segregation in the system,
for very low levels of homophily as well as for various levels of in-group avoidance. These
results suggest that reducing xenophobia and encouraging integration is a more effective
policy lever than reducing homophily.
The most surprising spatial pattern is the one that obtains when both out-group preference and in-group avoidance are present: groups tend to separate in a checkerboard pattern,
a configuration that is identified as supra-randomly mixed by the spatial proximity index
(values less than 1), but as highly segregated by the dissimilarity index. In other words,
when we have tendencies toward integration as well as internal separation of the groups, the
result is a patchwork of homogeneous neighborhoods arranged so that, on average, members
of one group live closer to members of the other group than to members of their own group.
This result suggests that residential systems may become segregated (at least according

to the dissimilarity index, the most widely used index) as a result of mechanisms that we
do not normally associate with the spatial separation of different ethnic groups. This result
also adds to the number of emerging concerns about the adequacy of existing segregation
indices and suggests that we are not completely aware of their behavior outside of well-known
residential scenarios. Since segregation indices reflect different ways of defining segregation,
these concerns speak to the very issue of when we know that we are indeed measuring “true”
or significant segregation.
The types of analyses conducted for the first time in this study add to our knowledge
of how statistical models for data with complex dependence may be used to better capture
large-scale social processes. They allow researchers to develop a more nuanced understanding
of the processes that lead to residential segregation than can be attained using models in
the Schelling tradition, and may suggest a more tailored approach to reducing segregation.
