Abstract
BACKGROUND
The United Nations (UN) Population Division is considering producing probabilistic projections for the total fertility rate (TFR) using the Bayesian hierarchical model of Alkema et al.
(2011), which produces predictive distributions of TFR for individual countries. The UN is interested in publishing probabilistic projections for aggregates of countries, such as regions and
trading blocs. This requires joint probabilistic projections of future country-specific TFRs,
taking account of the correlations between them.
OBJECTIVE
We propose an extension of the Bayesian hierarchical model that allows for probabilistic
projection of TFR for any set of countries.
METHODS
We model the correlation between country forecast errors as a linear function of time invariant
covariates, namely whether the countries are contiguous, whether they had a common colonizer
after 1945, and whether they are in the same UN region. The resulting correlation model is
incorporated into the Bayesian hierarchical model‚Äôs error distribution.
RESULTS
We produce predictive distributions of TFR for 1990-2010 for each of the UN‚Äôs primary regions.
We find that the proportions of the observed values that fall within the prediction intervals
from our method are closer to their nominal levels than those produced by the current model.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that a significant proportion of the correlation between forecast errors for
TFR in different countries is due to countries‚Äô geographic proximity to one another, and that
if this correlation is accounted for, the quality of probabilitistic projections of TFR for regions
and other aggregates is improved.

Introduction

The United Nations (UN) Population Division produces population estimates and projections
every two years for all countries and publishes them in the biennial World Population Prospects
(WPP). These projections are used by UN agencies and governments for planning, monitoring
development goals and as inputs to climate change and other models. They are also widely
used by social and health science researchers and the private sector. The UN produces these
population forecasts by projecting countries‚Äô age- and sex-specific fertility, mortality, and
migration rates, and combining them to obtain age- and sex-specific population sizes using
the standard cohort component method.
In this paper, we focus on the fertility component. Country fertility in a given time period
is summarized by the period total fertility rate (TFR), which is the average number of children
a woman would bear if she lived past the end of the reproductive age span and at each age
experienced the age-specific fertility rates of the given country and time period. Projections of
future TFR are decomposed using forecasted age schedules to obtain projections of age-specific
fertility rates.
The WPP reports three projection variants (low, medium, and high) for the population
and vital rates based on expert opinion and models of historical patterns. The low and high
variants correspond to TFR half a child below and above the medium value, respectively. A
drawback of these projections is that the range given by the low and high variants has no
probabilistic interpretation and hence does not reflect the uncertainty in the forecasts.
For the 2010 WPP (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2011), the UN used as its medium projection the predictive median of TFR from
a Bayesian hierarchical model developed by Alkema et al. (2011). We refer to this model as
the ‚Äúcurrent model‚Äù. This model produces predictive probability distributions of each country‚Äôs TFR, although the distributions were not used in the 2010 WPP. The model is based
on the demographic transition, where countries move from high birth and death rates to low
birth and death rates, and is composed of three phases: before, during and after the fertility
transition. Predictions from this model are typically summarized by the median country TFR
prediction and the 80% or 95% prediction interval.
In addition to producing population estimates at the country level, the UN also provides
projections for country aggregates such as geographic regions and trading blocs. The country
TFR projections from the current Bayesian hierarchical model of Alkema et al. (2011) can be
combined to obtain regional probabilistic TFR projections, provided the current model takes

account of the dependence between countries‚Äô fertility rates. However, if dependence exists
between country TFRs that is not accounted for in the Bayesian hierarchical model, treating
the country-specific projections as independent may underestimate the uncertainty about the
future TFRs and populations of aggregates.
Figure 1 shows the UN‚Äôs 22 primary regions of the world and Table 1 summarizes the
coverage probability of the out-of-sample TFR prediction intervals for these regions based on
the current model. The coverage probabilities of the region-specific predictive intervals are
smaller than the nominal levels, even though the country-specific coverages have been found
to be approximately correct (Alkema et al., 2011). This suggests that the assumption of
independent forecast errors may not be appropriate.

In this article, we propose an extension to the Bayesian hierarchical model that produces
TFR estimates for any aggregate of countries by modeling the residual correlation between
country TFRs. Our extension adds a correlation structure to the error distribution in the
hierarchical model, where the correlation between a pair of countries is modeled as a linear
function of time invariant covariates. Three covariates are chosen: whether two countries
are contiguous, whether they had a common colonizer after 1945, and whether they are in
the same UN region. This model provides estimates of the correlation between any pair of
countries, even when empirical estimates are not available.
Correlation matrices based on the linear function of covariates in our extension are not
positive semidefinite, and hence are not valid for prediction, for many values of the covariate
coefficients. This makes estimation of the covariate coefficients difficult. In addition, while
simulation of forecast errors from a correlation matrix requires only that the matrix be positive
semidefinite (and so may be singular), traditional estimation procedures such as maximum
likelihood estimation do not accommodate singular covariance matrices. Thus, such estimation
methods are unsatisfactory for this problem. We propose instead estimating the coefficients
by maximizing a pseudo-likelihood function defined by the country pairwise correlations.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review the current model and
introduce the correlation model extension. We also describe the exploratory analyses that
led to the choice of model extension. An estimation procedure based on a pseudo-likelihood
function is described, and model validation results are then presented for the prediction of the
TFR in each of the UN‚Äôs regions. We show theoretically which regional prediction intervals are
most affected by the correlation model and compare the pairwise country correlation values
from our model and those obtained in previous studies. We conclude with a discussion of
previous work.

Methodology
Current Model

The Bayesian hierarchical model of Alkema et al. (2011) divides the evolution of TFR in a
country into three phases: before, during and after the fertility transition. During the fertility
transition, the TFR for country c in time period t, fc,t , is modeled as following a systematic
decline curve with normally distributed random errors. After the fertility transition is complete, the TFR is modeled as a first order autoregressive process that ultimately fluctuates

3

about 2.1, which is considered replacement level fertility. If ft = (f1,t , ...., fC,t ) is the TFR for
all countries at time t, the model can be written as follows:
ft = mt + t ,

e tT œÉ
et)
t ‚àº N(0, Œ£t = œÉ

Fertility transition phase:

Post-transition phase:

mc,t = fc,t‚àí1 ‚àí d(Œ∏c , fc,t‚àí1 )
œÉ
ec,t = œÉc,t (Œ∏c , fc,t‚àí1 )

mc,t = 2.1 + 0.9(fc,t‚àí1 ‚àí 2.1)
œÉ
ec,t = s = 0.2

(1)

In (1), the quantities in bold font are vectors whose elements correspond to different
countries, d(Œ∏c , fc,t‚àí1 ) is a double logistic function controlling the rate of the fertility decline,
and Œ∏c is a vector of country-specific parameters. The expected TFR in the next time period,
2
, differ in the transition and post-transition
mc,t , and the variances of the random errors, œÉ
ec,t
phases. Since a country‚Äôs TFR is not modeled before the fertility decline, the vector ft for
any time point t contains only those countries that have started or completed their fertility
transition.
The data used to estimate the country parameters Œ∏c in the current model are the five-year
time period TFR estimates from 1950 to 2010 in the 2010 WPP. A posterior distribution of
the parameters is produced which indicates the probable values of the parameters given the
data. In addition, a predictive distribution of TFR values for each country can be obtained by
forecasting future values using the relations in (1). Figure 2 shows the predictive distribution
of TFR for Egypt from 2010 to 2050. This distribution is summarized by the median prediction
and the 80%, 90%, and 95% prediction intervals.

2.2

Correlation Model

As discussed above, the regional TFR prediction intervals from the current model tend to be
too narrow (see Table 1). This suggests there is excess correlation between countries‚Äô TFRs
that is not accounted for in the current model. To capture this excess correlation, we propose
modifying the error structure in (1) to allow for correlation between countries as follows:
e tT Rt œÉ
e t ).
t ‚àº N(0, Œ£t = œÉ

(2)

The (i, j) element of the matrix Rt is the correlation between the TFR forecast errors (i.e.
deviations from the mean predicted values mc,t ) for country i and country j in time period t.

Our exploratory analyses, described below, indicated that the correlations had a different
pattern when both countries had low fertility than otherwise, and our model allows for this. We
sought to model the correlations using temporally stable characteristics of the country pairs,
so that they could reasonably be used for projections. Thus, the elements of the correlation
matrix are modeled as

where contigi,j = 1 if countries i and j are contiguous and 0 if not, comcoli,j = 1 if they had
a common colonizer after 1945, and sameRegioni,j = 1 if they are in the same UN region.
The correlation model in (3) states that when countries i and j both have TFR below
(1)

(2)

Œ∫, the correlation of their errors in the next time period is œÅij , and the correlation is œÅij

when at least one of them has a TFR greater than Œ∫. In both cases, the correlation between
two countries is modeled as a linear combination of the three pairwise country covariates.

the correlation when both countries have TFR less than Œ∫, and {Œ≤0 , Œ≤1 , Œ≤2 , Œ≤3 } for the
correlation when at least one of the two TFRs is greater than Œ∫.
Since the diagonal elements of Rt are equal to one, the joint predictive distribution of all
country TFRs will have the same country marginal predictive distributions as those from the
current model. Thus expanding the model to allow for correlation will not change the marginal
country-specific predictive distributions, which is desirable given the good performance of the
current model for individual countries.

Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory analysis of one-time-period-ahead forecast errors from the model of Alkema et al.
(2011) and WPP data from 1950 to 2010 guided specification of the correlation model structure. For each time period and country, the forecast error is the difference between the
observed TFR and the average predicted value given TFR in the previous time period. Estimating the correlations between these forecast errors is difficult because the estimates are
based on a small amount of data (at most 11 five-year periods), and because the countryspecific predictive means and variances are given by the Bayesian hierarchical model. To
obtain empirical estimates of the correlation between the forecast errors for two countries,
conditional on their predictive variances, we used the posterior mean with an arc-sine prior.
This estimator was proposed by Fosdick and Raftery (2012), who showed it to have good small
sample performance compared to other frequentist and Bayesian estimators.
Figure 3 shows the number of five-year time periods from 1955 to 2010 for each country
pair after both had started their fertility decline. These counts represents the number of
forecast errors used to compute each correlation estimate. Since a number of countries have
only recently started their fertility decline, many pairwise correlation estimates were based
on only a few observations or, in the case of only two overlapping time periods, were not
computed at all. We therefore modeled the correlation structure rather than directly using
the noisy empirical estimates from the raw data.
The correlation estimates were higher on average when both countries had low TFR and
had completed or nearly completed the fertility transition. This led us to specify one model
for the correlation when the TFRs of both countries were below a threshold Œ∫, and a different
model when at least one country had TFR above Œ∫, where Œ∫ is to be estimated from the data.
The average estimated correlation between countries in the same UN-defined region when
both have TFR below 3 was 0.37, and for countries in different regions was 0.09, using only

correlation estimates based on at least eight time periods. This suggests that the correlation
between forecast errors at low TFR levels may be related to geographical proximity, and
motivates modeling the correlation as a function of geographical predictors.
Since our aim is to make long-term projections, we consider only predictors that are essentially time invariant. A database of country pairwise covariates is available from the Centre
d‚ÄôEtudes Prospectives et d‚ÄôInformations Internationales (CEPII) (Mayer and Zignago, 2006).
A list of the pairwise covariates in this database is shown in Table 2. Using linear regression,
we found that the covariates most predictive of the correlation estimates are whether two countries are contiguous (contig), whether they share a common colonizer after 1945 (comcol), and
whether they are in the same UN region (sameRegion).

Parameter Estimation

Our method for estimating the parameters of the correlation model in (3) relies on the onetime-period-ahead standardized forecast errors. The Bayesian hierarchical model of Alkema
et al. (2011) was fit to the 2010 WPP TFR estimates from 1950 to 2010, and posterior
distributions of Œ∏c given the data were obtained for each country. Using these parameter
estimates and the TFR in a given time period, a predictive distribution of the expected TFR
mc,t for the next time period was computed. The value of mc,t for a parameter vector Œ∏c is

The standardized errors can be viewed as samples from a multivariate normal model with

correlation model parameters {Œ∫, Œ≤0 , Œ≤1 , Œ≤2 , Œ≤3 , Œ≤0 , Œ≤1 , Œ≤2 , Œ≤3 } via maximum likelihood estimation based on the multivariate normal model. However, this is made challenging
by the fact that for any time period t, the vector et contains standardized errors for only those
countries that have started their fertility decline by time t, and that for many parameter values
the estimated correlation matrix is not positive definite, making the likelihood undefined.
Instead, we took a pseudo-likelihood approach that approximates the multivariate normal likelihood by a product of bivariate normal likelihoods (Besag, 1975). We call this the
Aggregation Pseudo-Likelihood (APL) and define it as

children at intervals of 0.1, we estimated the model parameters by maximizing the APL in
(4) numerically using a Nelder-Mead method.
The APL was maximized at Œ∫ = 5 children, and the corresponding regression coefficients
are shown in Table 3. These estimates mirror the exploratory analysis result that correlations
9

are larger on average when both countries have lower TFR. At TFR values below Œ∫, the
correlation between two countries that are contiguous and in the same region but do not
share a common colonizer is 0.46. The correlation between countries that are not in the same
region but are contiguous is 0.37. The corresponding values when at least one TFR is above
Œ∫ are 0.13 and 0.11, respectively. Country pairs with no colonial or geographic relationship
have a correlation of 0.11 when both TFRs are below Œ∫, and 0.05 otherwise. This illustrates
that the correlation between two countries is associated with their geographic and colonial
relationship.

For many time periods, the APL estimates of the parameters result in estimated correlation matrices Rt that are symmetric but not positive semidefinite. However, the correlation
matrix must be positive semidefinite to use it for simulation of forecast errors. The symmetric
positive semidefinite matrix closest in Frobenius norm to a given symmetric matrix is obtained
by zeroing out all negative eigenvalues of the original matrix (Driessel, 2007) and then reconstructing the matrix. Thus, at each time point t for which Rt is not positive semidefinite, we
perform the following procedure:
1. Compute the eigenvalue decomposition of Rt to express it as Rt = U DU T , where U is
an orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors and D is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

The rescaling of the correlation matrix in step 4 ensures that the predictive distribution of
TFR for any individual country remains the same as from the current Bayesian hierarchical

Model Validation

We assessed the model by estimating the current hierarchical model parameters from the data
for 1950 to 1990, projecting regional TFR for the UN‚Äôs 22 primary regions from 1990 to 2010
using the error correlation structure, and comparing the probabilistic projections with the
actual observations for the four held-out five-year periods. We approximated regional TFR by
a weighted average of country-specific TFRs, with weights proportional to the current female
populations of each country. A similar approximation was used for regional life expectancy
by Raftery et al (2012a).
Posterior distributions of the Bayesian hierarchical model parameters were obtained based
on data from 1950 to 1990. The parameter values in Table 3 were used in the correlation
model and not re-estimated based on the restricted data set, since these estimates are already
based on very limited data. Projections of TFR were obtained for the four five-year time
periods from 1990 to 2010 under the current model assuming independent errors and using
our proposed error correlation structure. The predictive distributions of the weighted average
TFR for each of the 22 regions were compared to the observed weighted average values.
Table 4 shows the proportion of observed weighted averages that fell within the 80%, 90%,
and 95% prediction intervals from both approaches. In each case the observed proportion
was closer or as close to the theoretical value under the correlation model than under the
independence model.
Figure 4 shows the posterior distribution of regional TFR for four regions, with the observed regional value shown in red. The box associated with a given period and projection
method represents the 80% interval and the ends of the whiskers correspond to the 95% interval. For Northern Europe the current model prediction intervals do not cover the observed
value in 1995 and 2000, but the correlation model prediction intervals do. Similar patterns are
seen in the other regions: the prediction intervals based on the correlation model are wider,
reflecting greater uncertainty, and contain more of the observed regional TFR values than the

Since the estimated correlations are larger when both countries have low TFR values, bigger differences between the current model and the correlation model prediction intervals are
seen for regions like Northern Europe and Central Asia, for which the majority of the countries have completed most of the fertility decline. Regions that have few countries with TFR
less than 5, such as Eastern and Western Africa, showed little change between the prediction
intervals from the current model and the correlation model, as expected.

Effect of Taking Account of Correlation

For a given parameter vector Œ∏ and time period t, the effect of taking account of correlation
on the variance of the regional TFR can be quantified analytically. We denote by pi the
proportion of the region‚Äôs female population that resides in country i, by fi the TFR in
country i in time period t, and by N the number of countries in the region. The regional
P
weighted average TFR is then i pi fi where the sum is over all countries in the region.
If the forecast errors are assumed to be independent as in the current model, the predictive
P
P
variance of the regional TFR in time period t is Var[ i pi fi ] = i p2i Var[fi ], where Var[fi ] =

We will refer to i p2i as the independence factor (IF) since it represents the ratio of the
regional variance to the country-specific variance assuming independence in the post-transition

and shows that the more evenly the regional female population is spread amongst the countries
within the region, the greater the variability in the regional estimate. This comes from the
fact that the IF is maximized when each pi =

as the dependence factor (DF) since it is the

multiplicative factor in the variance under the correlation model. Equation (6) shows that
the larger the country correlations, especially between those countries with a relatively high
proportion of the regional female population, the larger the variance of the regional TFR.
The ratios of the dependence factor to the independence factor for the 22 UN regions are
shown in Table 5. The regions with the largest ratios are those whose predictive distributions
are most impacted by between-country correlations. For example, Western Africa and Eastern
Asia‚Äôs ratios are both greater than 2.5, indicating that the variance of the regional TFR
predictive distributions is more than 2.5 times greater for the model with the correlation
structure than that from the current model. Those regions with ratios close to 1, such as
Northern America and Australia/New Zealand, have similar predictive distributions from the
two models.
Both the between-country correlations and the proportion of the regional female population
within each country influence the effect of the correlations. The number of countries in the

region and the proportion of the regional female population that live in the largest country
are also shown in Table 5. If a high proportion of the female population lives in a single
country, correlations will not have a large effect on the prediction intervals for the region.
Examples of this include Northern America and Eastern Asia which have low DF/IF ratios
and high proportions of the female population in a single country. Overall, the regions whose
predictive intervals in the future will be most highly affected by between-country correlations
include Middle, Eastern and Northern Africa, Western and Central Asia, Eastern and Western
Europe, South America, and the Caribbean.

Comparison to Previous Results

Others have investigated the correlation between country forecast errors and obtained similar
results to those reflected by the correlation model here. Keilman and Pham (2004) modeled
TFR in 18 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) with an autoregressive conditional
heteroscedastic model and calculated the average correlation between country TFR errors to
be 0.33. Although not all countries in the EEA are within the same UN region, in our model
two countries with low TFR that are in the same region and not contiguous have a correlation
of 0.2 and those not in the same region but are contiguous have a value of 0.37. The magnitudes
of these correlations are similar to those found by Keilman and Pham (2004).
When Alho (2008) further studied the correlation matrix obtained by Keilman and Pham
(2004), he found a stark contrast between the correlations between the Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece) and all others. His estimate of the average correlation
between forecast errors in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries was 0.12 and the
correlation within each of these groups was 0.3. Recall that in our model, the correlation between countries that have low TFR and have no geographic or colonial relation is 0.11. Overall
the correlations between and within groups of countries from our model are comparable to
those found empirically by others.
Wilson and Bell (2007) modeled TFR using a random walk with drift and found the
correlation between errors for Queensland and the rest of Australia to be 0.4. According to
our correlation model, when TFR is less than 5, as it has been in Australia for many decades,
the correlation between Australia and a hypothetical country contiguous to it would be 0.46.
This is consistent with the result of Wilson and Bell (2007).

Discussion

When producing probabilistic population projections for country aggregates, it is critical to
take account of between-country correlations in forecast errors of vital rates (Lutz, 1996; Lee,
1998; Bongaarts and Bulatao, 2000). In this paper we have proposed a method for estimating
between-country correlations in forecast errors of the TFR for all countries and using them
to produce probabilistic TFR forecasts for aggregates of countries such as regions. For many
country pairs there are few relevant data available, and so we estimate the correlations by
modeling them as a function of three time-invariant predictors.
The resulting method yields the same probabilistic projections of TFR for individual coun-

16

tries as the Bayesian hierarchical model of Alkema et al. (2011), which was used by the UN for
its (deterministic) medium population projections for all countries in the 2010 WPP (United
Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2011). In an out-ofsample validation experiment, our correlation extension yielded better coverage of predictive
intervals than the current model of Alkema et al. (2011) that does not explicitly take account
of between-country correlations. The posterior samples produced by our method can be incorporated into probabilistic population projections in the same way as those produced by
the current method (Raftery et al 2012b).
Other ways of doing this have been proposed. Based on Alho and Spencer (2005)‚Äôs method
of constructing correlated projections using random seeds, Lutz et al. (1997) and Lutz et al.
(2001) combined projections, where the within and/or between region country correlation was
zero or one, to obtain overall correlations of 0.5 and 0.7 between forecast errors. Although this
method produces forecast errors with the desired marginal correlation, the individual forecasts
come from a mixture distribution of two extreme scenarios neither of which is realistic.
Keilman and Pham (2004) and Alho (2008) estimated correlations between TFR forecast
errors for a set of European countries for which long and high quality time series data are
available, and for which the TFRs have been low for a long time in most cases. This is the best
case scenario, for which empirical estimates of the correlations are reasonably accurate and
further modeling is probably unnecessary. Our method gives similar estimates to theirs for
the countries that they consider. Wilson and Bell (2007) developed probabilistic population
projections for Queensland and the rest of Australia using an empirical correlation between
TFR errors. Again, this is a good data situation, and their empirical correlation estimates
are consistent with our model-based ones.
