Abstract
We extend Bayesian population reconstruction, a recent method for estimating
past populations by age, with fully probabilistic statements of uncertainty. It simultaneously estimates age-specific population counts, fertility rates, mortality rates and
net international migration flows from fragmentary data while formally accounting for
measurement error. As inputs, Bayesian reconstruction takes initial bias-reduced estimates of age-specific population counts, fertility rates, survival proportions and net
international migration. We extend the method to apply to countries without censuses
at regular intervals. We also develop a method for using it to assess the consistency
between model life tables and available census data, and hence to compare different
model life table systems. We show that the method works well in countries with widely

The release of World Population Prospects 2010 (WPP 2010; United Nations [UN] 2011a)
coincided with considerable interest in the size of the world population in both the popular
and academic literature (e.g. Gillis & Dugger 2011; Reuters 2011; Phillips 2011; Nagarajan 2011; Alberts 2011) perhaps due to the then imminent arrival of the seven billionth
person. There was considerable uncertainty about when that person would be born. In this
article, we extend and apply a new method, introduced by Wheldon, Raftery, Clark, and
Gerland (2012), for estimating past and current population by age and sex and for assessing
the associated uncertainty.
Information about uncertainty can be conveyed by providing interval estimates, rather
than simply point estimates as is done for many official statistical releases. Such intervals
should have a probabilistic interpretation; they should contain the true value with some
specified probability, conditional on the assumed statistical model. Wheldon et al.’s (2012)
method produces such intervals. It reconstructs population structures of the past by embedding formal demographic relationships in a Bayesian hierarchical model. The outputs are
joint probability distributions of demographic rates and population counts from which fully
probabilistic interval estimates can be derived in the form of Bayesian confidence intervals
(or “credible intervals”). The method has been designed to fit within the United Nations
Population Division (UNPD)’s current work-flow and to deal with the lack of reliable data
commonly experienced in many developing countries. Nevertheless, we hope it is general
enough to be useful for other demographers interested in estimating population structures
of the past. We will refer to the new method as “Bayesian reconstruction”.
Our aims are as follows. We show that Bayesian reconstruction is useful in a wide range
of data quality contexts by reconstructing the populations of countries for which data quality
varies from poor to extremely good. In all cases, Bayesian reconstruction indicates when
estimates of vital rates are inconsistent with census results. This means that the method can
be used to compare competing model life tables. We also extend the method to unevenly
spaced censuses.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we review existing
methods of population reconstruction. Following that, we describe the method. Then we
apply Bayesian reconstruction to the female populations of three countries: The People’s
1

Democratic Republic of Laos (Laos), Sri Lanka and New Zealand. The New Zealand case
shows that the model performs sensibly for countries with very good data and the Laos
case for fragmentary data. We use the case of Sri Lanka to demonstrate our extension to
unevenly spaced censuses. Bayesian reconstruction detected inconsistencies between surveybased estimates of fertility and intercensal population changes, and provided a correction.
There is relatively little mortality data for Laos and we use this case to illustrate how
Bayesian reconstruction can be used to choose between competing model life tables. We
conclude with a discussion.

Population Reconstruction Methods

Many human population reconstructions in the demography literature fall into one of two
categories: reconstruction of populations of the distant past using data of the kind commonly found in European parish registers (e.g. Lee 1971, 1974; Wrigley & Schofield 1981;
Oeppen 1993a, 1993b; Bertino & Sonnino 2003) and reconstruction of population dynam´ Gr´ada 1986; Daponte,
ics after extreme crises such as famine or genocide (e.g. Boyle & O
Kadane, & Wolfson 1997; Heuveline 1998; Merli 1998; Goodkind & West 2001). General
methodology has been primarily developed in the former context, the latter being necessarily focused on special cases. In some form or another, the cohort component model of
population projection (CCMPP) (Lewis 1942; Leslie 1945, 1948) is central to almost all
methods of population reconstruction.
Two significant developments were Lee’s (1971, 1974) “inverse projection” and Wrigley
and Schofield’s (1981) “back projection”. Inverse projection converts counts of births and
deaths into the respective rates. Reconstruction proceeds forward in time. Counts of baseline
population and model age patterns of fertility and mortality are also required. Where at
least two independent estimates of population size are available, net migration can also be
estimated (Lee 1985). In contrast, back projection takes counts at the terminal year and then
moves backward in time, reconstructing population counts and net migration along the way.
Several iterations might be required to produce a satisfactory result. There was considerable
debate about the efficacy of back projection, centered partly around identifiability issues that
arise from trying to “resurrect” members of the open ended age group and simultaneously
estimate fertility, mortality and migration rates (Lee 1985, 1993). Further developments are
described by Barbi, Bertino, and Sonnino (2004). Oeppen (1993a), Oeppen (1993b) and
Bonneui and Fursa (2011) frame reconstruction as a high dimensional optimization problem.
All of the above methods are deterministic and produce point estimates only.
Stochastic inverse projection (SIP) was proposed by Bertino and Sonnino (2003). It incor-

2

porates a specific kind of stochastic variation into the reconstruction, taking inputs similar
to those required by inverse projection. Model age patterns of fertility and mortality are
treated as individual-level probabilities of death rather than fixed, population-level rates.
Like its predecessors, stochastic inverse projection (SIP) was designed to work with accurate
time-series of total births and deaths. The uncertainty in the final estimates comes only
from modeling birth and death as stochastic processes at the level of the individual (Lee
1998 called this “branching process uncertainty”). There is no allowance for measurement
error in the data, nor is there any stochastic variation in the model fertility and mortality
age patterns. For most developing and less-developed countries, information about births
and deaths is not highly accurate, and age patterns of births and deaths are known only
approximately. In these cases, the uncertainty is due mainly to measurement error. In fact,
even for well-measured populations, at the national level where counts are large, Lee (2003)
and E. Cohen (2006) note that uncertainty due to stochastic vital rates is likely to be small
relative to uncertainty due to measurement error; see also Pollard (1968).
The aim of Daponte et al. (1997) was to construct a counterfactual history of the Iraqi
Kurdish population from 1977 to 1990, a period during which it was the target of considerable state-sponsored violence. A Bayesian approach was taken in which vital rates and
population counts were modeled as probability distributions. Prior distributions for fertility and mortality rates based on survey data and beliefs about the uncertainty founded on
studies of the data sources, historical information and knowledge of demographic processes.
Conclusions from estimated posterior distributions took the form of fully probabilistic interval estimates. This approach took account of uncertainty due to measurement error and
made use of contextual knowledge to make up for fragmentary, unreliable data. However,
there were some restrictions, such as allowing mortality to vary only through the infant
mortality rate and specifying fixed age patterns of fertility. Our approach is similar in spirit
but more flexible as no model age patterns are assumed to hold throughout the period of
reconstruction.

Method

Mathematical details can be found in Wheldon et al. (2012) and the Appendix. Here we give
a more conceptual overview. All computation was done using the freely available statistical
software package R (R Development Core Team 2012); Bayesian population reconstruction
is implemented in the package “popReconstruct”.

2.1

Description of the Model

The method reconciles two different estimates of population counts, those based on adjusted
census counts (or similar data) and those derived by projecting initial estimates of the
baseline population forward using initial estimates of vital rates. Adjusted census counts are
raw counts which have been processed to reduce common biases such as undercount and age
heaping. Since projection is done using the CCMPP, the parameters for which we require
initial point estimates are the CCMPP inputs, namely population counts for the baseline
year, fertility rates, survival proportions and the net number of migrants, all by age group,
over the period of reconstruction. Migration is treated in the same way as fertility, mortality
and baseline population counts.
Estimates of the measurement error for each parameter are also required. These can be
based on expert judgment or preliminary analyses such as post-enumeration surveys. Data
and expert knowledge sufficient to generate these inputs are available for most countries from
about 1960. The comparison is through a Bayesian hierarchical (or multilevel), statistical
model which provides probabilistic posterior distributions of the inputs, as well as population
counts at each projection step in the period of reconstruction.
Initial point estimates of the input parameters are derived from data. Baseline population
estimates come from adjusted census counts (or similar sources), fertility and mortality
estimates from surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) and vital
registration. The model defines a joint prior distribution over these parameters which is
parameterized by the initial point estimates and standard deviations. Typically, the initial
point estimates will serve as the marginal medians of this distribution, but this is not a
requirement. The standard deviations represent measurement uncertainty about the point
estimates. These distributions induce a probability distribution on the population counts at
the end of each projection step within the period of reconstruction. Uncertainty about the
true population numbers at the time of a census is also modeled by probability distributions.
Adjusted census counts are taken as the median of these distributions and measurement
uncertainty is represented analogously by standard deviations.
It is important that counts (adjusted or otherwise) from censuses in years after the
baseline year not be used to derive initial estimates of fertility, mortality and migration.
This means, for example, that intercensal survival rates should not be used to estimate
mortality, and that “residual” counts, the difference between census counts and counts based
on a projection using fertility and mortality alone, should not be used to estimate migration.
Doing so would amount to using the census data twice, once to derive initial estimates of
vital rates and once to derive adjusted census counts, which would lead to an underestimate
of uncertainty.
4

In standard Bayesian terms, treating the induced distribution of projected counts as a
prior and the distribution of census counts as a likelihood, Bayesian reconstruction yields
a posterior distribution of the inputs via Bayesian updating. This distribution can be usefully summarized by marginal Bayesian confidence intervals for each input parameter which
express uncertainty probabilistically. Furthermore, confidence intervals for age-summarized
parameters such as total fertility rate (TFR) and life expectancy at birth (e0 ) can be obtained.
Using simulation, Wheldon et al. (2012) found that Bayesian reconstruction produced wellcalibrated marginal Bayesian confidence intervals. That is, p-percent Bayesian confidence
intervals for each parameter of interest were found to contain the true value p percent of the
time.
Often, projected counts based on a sample from the joint prior on the input parameters
will not equal the same-year adjusted census counts. This discrepancy is sometimes called
an “error of closure” (Preston, Heuveline, & Guillot 2001). The discrepancy can be reduced
by making appropriate adjustments to any, or all, of the CCMPP input parameters and
census counts. Many different combinations of adjustments will have the same effect on
the discrepancy; for example, adding a migrant of age x has the same effect on the age-x
population count as removing a death to a person of age x. The posterior distribution is a
distribution over all possible combinations of CCMPP input parameters which assigns higher
probability to those combinations leading to larger reductions in the discrepancy. This means
that each age-time specific component of the input parameters is not affected equally, but
proportionately according to the effect it has on the joint posterior.
In our case studies, the periods of reconstruction are delimited by the earliest and most
recent censuses. Reconstruction can be done beyond the year of the most recent census
if initial estimates of vital rates and international migration are available, but these latter
initial estimates cannot be updated without a census.

2.2

Bias

Estimates of vital rates and population counts from surveys and censuses are susceptible to
bias. For example, fertility rate estimates based on birth histories suffer from omission and
misplacement of births due to recall error and census counts may be biased due to undercount
in certain age groups (Zitter & McArthur 1980; Preston et al. 2001). Bayesian reconstruction
does not treat bias explicitly because demographic data differ markedly across parameters,
time and countries. Many methods for estimating and reducing these biases have been
proposed such as post-censal enumeration surveys (e.g., United Nations [UN] 2008, 2010),
“indirect” methods (e.g., United Nations [UN] 1983), and Alkema, Raftery, Gerland, Clark,
and Pelletier’s (2012) method for TFR. Methods appropriate for adjusting census data will
5

not, in general, be applicable to vital registration or survey data. Even within these broad
categories, there is great variation among countries and time which makes development of
a general approach infeasible. Therefore, the analyst applying Bayesian reconstruction will
need to select bias reduction methods appropriate to the data being used. We illustrate
some possibilities in the case studies.

2.3

Measurement Error Uncertainty

Bias reduced initial point estimates of the CCMPP input parameters are still subject to
measurement error; that is, variation that is non-systematic and cannot realistically be eliminated or otherwise modeled. In Bayesian reconstruction, measurement error is represented
by the prior standard deviations of the initial estimates. In many cases there is not much
data with which to estimate these parameters, but there is often a great deal of relevant
expert knowledge. This can be included by giving the variances themselves prior distributions and using the expert knowledge to set the fixed hyperparameters of these distributions,
thereby defining a hierarchical model. To do this, we require a value for p in statements of the
form “there is a 90 percent probability that the true fertility rates are within plus-or-minus
p percent of the initial point estimates”, and similarly for survival proportions, migration
proportions and population counts. We asked UNPD analysts to provide p, which we refer
to as the “elicited relative error”. See the Appendix for further details.

Case Studies

To show that Bayesian reconstruction works in a variety of situations, we used the subjective
but useful evaluations of UNPD analysts to select three countries based on the quality of
their mortality rate data: 1) New Zealand, with complete vital rate data based on vital
registration; 2) Sri Lanka with good vital rate data requiring only small adjustments; 3)
Laos with only limited under-five mortality estimates available and fertility data from a few
demographic surveys. Thus we analyze New Zealand with excellent data, Sri Lanka with
intermediate data, and Laos with poor data. Wheldon et al. (2012) analyzed Burkina Faso
which, in terms of data availability, sits between Laos and Sri Lanka, having data on both
adult and under-five mortality.
Each case is discussed separately below. We briefly describe the original data sources
and the processes used to derive the initial estimates, and present results for four demographic parameters: TFR, net number of migrants, e0 and under-five mortality. We give the
limits of 95 percent Bayesian confidence intervals of our initial estimates and the posterior
distributions of selected parameters using the notation: “(lower, upper)”. We compare our
6

results for fertility and mortality to those published in WPP 2010 for years with comparable
estimates. WPP 2010 was based on a different procedure but the same data, therefore the
comparison is useful.
We cover the highlights here; more detailed descriptions of the data sources, initial estimates and results are in the Appendix (Section B).

Laos, 1985–2005

3.1.1

Data and Initial Estimates

National censuses were conducted in 1985, 1995 and 2005. These data allow us to reconstruct
the female population between 1985 and 2005. We used the census year counts in WPP 2010;
there were no post-enumeration surveys, but these counts were adjusted to compensate for
undercount in certain age groups.
Initial estimates of age-specific fertility rates were based on direct and indirect estimates from the available surveys. Age-specific initial estimates were obtained by multiplying
smoothed estimates of TFR by smoothed estimates of the age-pattern of fertility. Due to
the small number of data points, smoothing was done by taking medians across data source
for each age- time-period.
The only available mortality data are for infant and under-five mortality. Therefore our
initial estimates came from the Coale and Demeny (1983) West (CD West) model life tables
with values of 1 q0 and 5 q0 close to those estimated from available data.
Elicited relative errors for population counts, fertility and mortality were set to 10 percent.
There is not much information about migration. To model this, we set initial point
estimates to zero for all ages and time periods, but used a large elicited relative error of 20
percent.
3.1.2

Results

Figure 1 shows our prior and posterior distributions for the four demographic parameters
together with WPP 2012 estimates for fertility and mortality. The Bayesian reconstruction
estimate of TFR differs from the initial estimates in the five-year periods beginning 1985,
1990 and 2000. While both imply consistent decreases in fertility, the initial estimates appear
to be too high in all but the third five-year period. Our posterior intervals suggest a level
of fertility more similar to WPP 2010, except our estimates suggest that the acceleration in
the decline begins one five-year period later.
Migration is estimated simultaneously with fertility and mortality. Posterior uncertainty
for the average annual total net number of migrants has been significantly reduced relative

7

to prior uncertainty (Figure 1b). The mean half-width of the posterior intervals is 6,099
compared with 142,777) for the prior intervals.
Figure 1a shows that the posterior intervals are not constrained to lie inside the prior
intervals. Moreover, the posterior intervals can be wider than the prior intervals. This
is the case for age-specific fertility rates for Laos. See the Appendix for further details
(Section B.1.2).

3.2.1

Sri Lanka, 1951–2001
Data and Initial Estimates

Censuses were conducted in Sri Lanka in 1953, 1963, 1971, 1981 and 2001 and so we reconstruct the female population between 1953 and 2001. We took population counts from
WPP 2010 which were adjusted to account for underenumeration. Initial estimates of agespecific fertility rates were derived in a manner similar to that used for Laos, although at
the level of TFR we used loess (Cleveland, Grosse, & Shyu 1992; Cleveland 1979) to smooth
multiple data points across time-period. Initial estimates of age-specific survival proportions
were based on abridged national life tables calculated form death registration and available
surveys. Elicited relative errors for all of these parameters were set at 10 percent.
We used the same default initial estimate of international migration as for Laos. Luther,
Gaminirante, de Silva, and Retherford (1987) provide age-specific estimates for the periods
1971–1975 and 1976–1980 using census data as well as information about vital rates. Their
results are not suitable as a basis for initial estimates because they were derived, in part,
from census counts, so we use them for comparison instead.
3.2.2

Interpolation to Handle Irregular Census Intervals

Wheldon et al. (2012) assumed that censuses were taken at regular intervals but there is an
irregular gap between the 1963 and 1971 censuses. Therefore, we propose interpolating the
CCMPP outputs on the growth rate scale such that they coincide with the census years. We
explain by way of an example.
Consider the number in the population aged [x, x + 5] for which we have a census-based
estimate at 1963 and another census-based estimate at 1971. Initial estimates for vital rates
are available at 1963, 1968, 1973, and at subsequent five-year increments. The CCMPP can
be used with these data to derive projected counts for this age group in 1968 and 1973. To
compare the CCMPP output with the census counts at 1971, we assume that the growth
rate for this age group, rx,1968 , was constant between 1968 and 1973, and estimate it from
the projected counts. The estimate is then used to interpolate the CCMPP output to 1971.

We use a similar method to extrapolate the population counts from the 1953 census back to
1951 using the 1953–1963 growth rate. Interpolating in this manner is adequate for periods
of length less than five years.
3.2.3

Results

Poster distributions for the demographic parameters are summarized in Figure 2. Our posterior estimates of mortality and migration agree closely with those of WPP 2010 and Luther
et al. (1987). Applying Bayesian reconstruction suggests, however, that the sources upon
which the initial estimates were based are inconsistent with intercensal changes in the number of births. The posterior estimates of TFR from Bayesian reconstruction differ noticeably
from the initial estimates in the periods 1951–1956 and 1956–1961 (posterior intervals (5.11,
5.71) and (5.24, 5.88); initial estimates 5.01 and 5.03 children per woman, respectively). Our
method has automatically provided a correction which, in this case, yields results similar to
the WPP 2010 estimates.

3.3.1

New Zealand, 1961–2006
Data and Initial Estimates

Census counts came from national censuses conducted every five years between 1961 and
2006. Initial estimates of fertility rates were calculated from published age-specific fertility
rates (Statistics New Zealand 2011a) and numbers of births (Statistics New Zealand 2012)
by age-group of mother by year. Initial estimates for survival proportions were calculated
from New Zealand life tables (Statistics New Zealand 2011b).
Information about the measurement errors of these parameters was available in the form
of census post-enumeration surveys (PESs) and estimates of the coverage achieved by the
birth and death registration systems. Elicited relative errors were based on this information
and were set to 2.5 percent, one percent, and one percent for population counts, fertility and
mortality, respectively.
Information about international migration is quite reliable given that New Zealand is a
small island nation with a well-resourced official statistics system. The basis of our initial
estimates of international migration are counts of permanent and long-term migrants (PLT)
migrants taken from arrivals and departures cards (Statistics New Zealand 2010c). The
largest source of error in these data as estimates of international migration is the discrepancy

3.3.2

Results

The posterior distributions for TFR, total net number of migrants, e0 and under-five mortality are summarized in Figure 3. Our posterior estimates of mortality and fertility follow
the initial estimates closely. This is not unexpected; the initial estimates were based on data
of high quality and coverage. The least reliable data, a priori, were those for migration. Our
posterior intervals suggest small corrections in some time periods. The initial estimates for
periods between 1961 and 1974 appear to be too high while those for periods between 1976
and 1989 are too low.

Choosing Between Alternative Initial Estimates of
Mortality

In our application to Laos we derived initial estimates of over-five mortality from the CD
West model life table. This choice was made by UNPD analysts who drew on previous
studies (Hartman 1996a, 1996b; United Nations [UN] 2011b). However, other approaches
are possible. Here, we compare the results above with those given by an alternative set of
initial estimates of survival based on a different model life table, and use them to explain why
the CD West model should be preferred. To do this, we look at the age specific mortality
rates, rather than e0 .
The posterior distribution of e0 in Figure 1c was computed from the posterior distribution
of the age specific survival proportions, 5 Sx [t, t + 5], which are output by Bayesian reconstruction. These were converted into age-specific annual mortality rates using the separation
factors implicit in the CD West life table. Medians and the limits of 95 percent Bayesian
confidence intervals for the marginal posterior distributions of these parameters are shown
in Figure 4 on the log scale. Posterior uncertainty about these quantities is very low; the
mean half-widths over age, within year, are all less than 0.004.
An alternative set of initial estimates for the 5 Sx [t, t+5] was generated from the same data
on under-five mortality, but adult mortality was estimated using the Brass two-parameter
relational logit model with the United Nations South Asian (UNSA) model life table, e0
= 57.5 years. Figure 5 gives the initial estimates and marginal posteriors of the survival
proportions using these alternative survival estimates, but keeping the initial estimates of all
other parameters the same. The posterior intervals are much wider under this set of initial
estimates; the mean half-widths over age, within year, are between 0.02 and 0.06; a five- to

fifteen-fold increase on the log scale.
The wider intervals show that using the alternative initial estimates greatly increases
posterior uncertainty. In addition, for many of the older age groups, the posterior medians
are actually closer to the CD West initial point estimates than those used to fit the model.
This suggests that the initial estimates based on the CD West life tables are much more
consistent with the intercensal changes in population counts, given the initial estimates
for the other parameters, and that they should be preferred over the UNSA-derived initial
estimates.
Looking at e0 in Figure 6 leads to the same conclusion. Again, uncertainty is much greater
under the alternative set of initial estimates (cf. Figure 3c). The posterior distribution has
shifted away from the initial estimates used to fit the model toward those derived from the
CD West model life table. In fact, all CD West initial point estimates are contained within
the 95 percent posterior interval based on the alternative estimates while this is not the case
for the initial estimates used to fit the model.

the same results shown in Figure 5.
We emphasize that our preferred set of initial estimates are those generated using the CD
West standard. Our purpose here is not to advocate for the UNSA standard, or the Brass
16

two-parameter logit model, but to present an alternative, plausible set of initial estimates
which we can use to generate an alternative set of posterior estimates for use in a comparative
analysis.

Discussion

In this article we have demonstrated and extended the method of reconstructing past,
national-level population structures introduced by Wheldon et al. (2012). This method embeds the standard CCMPP in a hierarchical statistical model which takes initial estimates of
vital rates and population counts as inputs, together with expert opinion about their relative
error (informed by data if available). International migration is handled in the same way as
the other inputs, and yields fully probabilistic interval estimates for all of the inputs. The
approach is Bayesian as the initial estimates serve as informative, but not restrictive, priors
for population counts through the CCMPP, which are then updated using available census
data over the period of reconstruction. Reconstruction can be undertaken for any period for
which estimates of baseline population, vital rates and international migration are available.
However, reconstruction beyond the year of the most recent census will be based on the
initial estimates alone.
We presented 95 percent Bayesian confidence intervals for the marginal distributions
of TFR, total net number of migrants, e0 and under-five mortality. Ninety-five percent
intervals cover the range of most likely values. Results for TFR and age-specific fertility
for Laos showed that the posterior intervals are not constrained to lie inside prior intervals,
nor are they necessarily more narrow than prior intervals. Our posterior estimates of TFR
for Laos and Sri Lanka suggested that, in some years, the initial estimates based mainly
on surveys were inconsistent with intercensal changes in the number of births and Bayesian
reconstruction was able to provide an appropriate correction.
We showed that the method works well when applied to different countries spanning a
wide range of data quality characteristics. For Laos, all mortality data are for ages five and
below and come from surveys, while New Zealand has complete period life tables based on
vital registration. Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso (analyzed in Wheldon et al. 2012) lie between
these extremes. The posterior intervals for New Zealand were much more narrow than those
for Sri Lanka and Laos, reflecting the greater accuracy and coverage of the New Zealand data.
The greatest value of Bayesian reconstruction is likely to be for those countries without wellresourced statistical systems. Roughly half of all the countries and areas included in the
WPP fall into this category (UN 2011a).
The method as described in Wheldon et al. (2012) was limited by the fact that it required

17

census data at regular intervals. Here, we have relaxed this requirement by showing that
linearly interpolating census counts on the growth rate scale produces good results.
We have also shown how Bayesian reconstruction might be used to help choose between
two sets of initial mortality estimates. We compared the posterior distributions of agespecific mortality rates for Laos derived from initial estimates based on the CD West model
life table and the Brass two-parameter relational logit with the UNSA model life table. In
the latter case, the interval widths were much greater. This implies that the CD West based
initial estimates agree much more closely with the data on fertility, mortality and population
counts and they should be preferred.
Bias and measurement error variance are handled separately under Bayesian reconstruction. Existing demographic techniques, such as indirect estimation via P/F ratios and model
life tables, are used to reduce bias in initial point estimates based on raw data collected from
surveys, vital registration and censuses. The nature of bias varies greatly across parameters,
time and country, hence we do not propose a general purpose method to replace the many
existing techniques. Instead, the analyst is able to select the most appropriate technique
for the data at hand. Measurement error variance is accounted for through the standard
deviations of the initial point estimates. Expert opinion is used a priori to set reasonable
ranges for measurement error uncertainty.
To ensure that uncertainty is not underestimated, census data should not be used to
derive initial point estimates of vital rates and migration. If no reliable migration data are
available, the default initial point estimates should be centered at zero with a large elicited
relative error.
Bayesian reconstruction was developed and demonstrated for female-only populations
and our immediate goal is to extend the method to two-sex populations. We anticipate
that focusing on a two-sex extension separately will allow us to more carefully consider the
dependencies between female- and male-specific parameters. A further potential refinement
is to use single-year age groups and time periods.
A great deal of attention has already been directed at the estimation of uncertainty in
demographic forecasts, as opposed to estimates about the past which we focus upon here.
The study of stochastic models for forecasting dates back to at least Pollard (1966) and Sykes
(1969). Further developments are reviewed by Booth (2006) with more recent additions in
Hyndman and Booth (2008), Scherbov, Lutz, and Sanderson (2011) and Alkema, Raftery,
Gerland, Clark, Pelletier, et al. (2011). One component of error in forecasts of population
size is the error in estimates of population size and the vital rates prevailing at the jump-off
time. While the ergodic theorems of Demography (Lotka & Sharpe 1911; Lopez 1961) imply
that these become irrelevant if one forecasts far enough into the future, short term forecasts

18

can be significantly affected (e.g., Keilman 1998; National Research Council, Commission
on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education 2000). It is possible, then, that Bayesian
reconstructions could contribute to improved forecasting methods by providing important
information about the uncertainty in estimates of jump-off populations.
The fact that official statistical estimates are not perfect is undisputed. The UNPD
acknowledges this both explicitly (UN 2011a) and implicitly in the fact that the WPP are
revised biannually as new sources of data become available and methods are improved.
Therefore, augmenting point estimates with quantitative estimates of their uncertainty is an
important contribution. For many countries, the available data are fragmented and subject
to bias and measurement error, thus the expert opinions of demographers are very valuable.
A Bayesian approach is especially appropriate since this can be used in conjunction with the
available data in a statistically coherent manner.

Technical Details of the Method

A.1

Model Description

The parameters of interest are fertility rates, survival proportions, population counts and
migration proportions. We use standard demographic notation and the symbols F , S and
N to refer to fertility, survival and population count, respectively. Hence, 5 Fx [t, t + 5]
is the average fertility rate among women aged [x, x + 5] over the time period [t, t + 5].
We adopt the symbol G for migration which we express as a proportion of the receiving
population (while M may seem like a more obvious choice, this letter is somewhat overloaded
in demography, variously used to stand for mortality and marital status, as well as migration).
Therefore the net number of migrants aged [x, x + 5] arriving during the period [t, t + 5] is
5 × 5 Gx [t, t + 5] × 5 Nx (t).
The open ended age group is 80+ in all of our case studies. Fertility is assumed to be
[fert]
[fert]
zero at ages below xL and above xU .
The period of reconstruction varies among countries due to data availability, therefore we
will use general symbols. Let t0 be the baseline year and T the final year of reconstruction.
Outputs will then be produced for the years t0 , t0 + 5, . . . , T . Censuses will be available
[cen]
only at certain years during the period of reconstruction; we denote census years by t1 <
[cen]

t2

, and so forth.

Using this notation, we can write Bayesian reconstruction as a hierarchical model with
four levels. For convenience, we use the symbol 5 θ x [t, t+5] to represent 5 Fx [t, t+5], 5 Sx [t, t+
5], 5 Gx [t, t + 5], 5 Nx (t) for all x = 0, 5, . . . , 80+, (85+); that is, the demographic rates
and proportions and the population counts for all age groups during the interval [t, t + 5].

Moreover, we use the expression CCMPP 5 θ x [t, t + 5] to denote the projection from t0 to
t + 5 using 5 θ x [t, t + 5]. The model is:

For 0 < y < 1, logit(y) ≡ log(y/(1 − y)). The starred quantities denote the initial point estimates which remain fixed in the estimation process. Un-starred quantities are the parameters
for which the joint posterior distribution is defined.

A.2

Determining the Hyperparameters α and β

The hyperparameters αv and βv in equation (A.7) must be determined by the user. They
define the distribution of the standard deviation parameters that represent the uncertainty
in the initial estimates. We set these parameters based on the expert opinion of UNPD
analysts.
The distributions of the vital rate and population count parameters in equations (A.3)–
(A.6) are conditional on the unknown variance parameters, hence draws from them are
not observable. However, standard calculations show that the marginal (unconditional)
distributions of these parameters are Student’s t centered at the initial point estimates and
with variance and degrees of freedom dependent on α and β. Draws from these distributions
are observable. It is about these observable quantities that we elicit expert opinion. This
differs from the method used by Wheldon et al. (2012) who used the unobservable quantities
modeled by the conditional distributions.
We set αv = 0.5 for all v in {F, S, G, N }. This gives the initial estimates a weight
equivalent to a single data point. The βv were then determined by specifying the limits
of the central ninety percent probability interval of the marginal distributions. Population
counts and fertility rates are modeled on the log scale so this amounts to making a statement
of the form “the probability that the true parameter values are the within p-percent of the

21

initial point estimates is ten percent”. Migration is explicitly modeled as a proportion so this
interpretation is direct for this parameter. Survival proportions are modeled on the logit (or
log-odds) scale. For values of 0 < y < 1 close to zero, logit(y) ≈ log(y), so we can proceed
as for fertility and population counts after converting n Sx∗ [t, t + 5] to 1 − n Sx∗ [t, t + 5]. Under


(A.5), 1 − logit n Sx [t, t + 5] has the same distribution as logit n Sx [t, t + 5] , so the βs arrived
at from assessing the relative error of 1 − n Sx∗ [t, t + 5] can be used without modification.

A.3

More on Measurement Error Uncertainty

In statistical models, this type of error is typically accounted for by standard deviation
parameters and is estimated from the sample standard deviation of independent, repeated
observations. This approach is not suitable for demographic data of the kind we treat
since repeated observations may not be available or, when they are, they are not typically
independent. For example, in countries with vital registration systems we might have only
a single data point for each age-time specific vital rate parameter, in which case there is no
replication. For countries without these systems several surveys may each yield estimates
of the same parameters and, moreover, more than one bias-reduction technique may have
been applied to the same source. There is replication in these cases, but it is incorrect to
estimate the measurement error varianace from the empirical variance of these observations
because they are not independent. For example, the results of applying several different
indirect methods to the results of the same survey are clearly not independent. Given
detailed information about the sampling methodology for specific surveys, one might be able
to extract some quantitative estimate of error due to sampling variability. In many cases,
however, the required information is not available. Even if it were, developing such estimates
for each parameter in each country would be a substantial undertaking and would have to
be done case-by-case. Therefore, we take a different approach and model measurement error
through the prior standard deviations of the initial estimates. These, in turn, are given
probability distributions at Level 4.

B

Further Details and Results from the Case Studies

We present results for four demographic parameters: TFR, net number of migrants, e0 and
under-five mortality. Under-five mortality is expressed as the number of deaths between ages
0 and 5 per 1,000 live births; it is a period measure. Life tables are used in the derivation
of initial estimates for all case studies. The separation factors implicit in these tables were
used to convert posterior estimates of age-specific survival proportions, a cohort measure,
into period mortality (Shryock, Siegel, and Associates 1980, Ch. 14, 15; Thomas Buettner
22

(pers. comm.)).

Laos
Data and Initial Estimates

Population Counts National censuses were conducted in 1985, 1995 and 2005. These
data allow us to reconstruct the female population between 1985 and 2005. We used the
census year counts in WPP 2010; there were no post-enumeration surveys, but these counts
were adjusted to compensate for undercount in certain age groups.
Fertility Initial point estimates of fertility were based on direct and indirect estimates of
age-specific fertility rates. Direct estimates were based on children ever born (CEB) and
recent births (preceding 12 and 24 months), all by age of mother, collected by the 1993 Laos
Social Indicator Survey, the 1995 and 2005 censuses, the 1994 Fertility and Birth Spacing
Survey, the 2000 and 2005 Lao Reproductive Health Surveys, the 1986–1988 multi-round
survey and the 2006 MICS3 survey. Indirect estimates were produced using the following
methods: Zaba’s (1981) Relational Gompertz Model, Arriaga’s (1983) method, the P/F
method (Brass et al. 1968), Arriaga’s (1983) modified P/F method and the Brass fertility
polynomial (Brass 1960; Brass & CELADE 1975). The indirect techniques applied were
either used by national agencies or chosen by UNPD analysts.
All data points were given equal weight during the process of producing initial estimates.
Averages for the five-year projection intervals were calculated using all observations with
reference years falling within the interval.
Age patterns and levels of fertility were estimated separately. Within each five-year time
period and each age group, a single schedule for each time period was derived by taking
medians across data points. The median schedules were then normalized to produce fertility
patterns. The level of fertility was estimated similarly except the data points were summed
to give estimates of average annual TFRs for each five-year period. Medians were taken
within time periods and the initial estimates were formed by multiplying each time period’s
median age pattern by the corresponding annual median TFR. The elicited relative error
was set to 10 percent. Hence, the medians of the initial estimate distributions for age-specific
fertility rates were the initial point estimates and the upper 95 percent and lower five percent
quantiles were equal to the initial point estimates plus and minus 10 percent, respectively.
Mortality Direct and indirect estimates of infant and under-five mortality (1 q0 , 5 q0 ) came
from maternity histories and CEB and surviving data collected by the 1993 Laos Social
Indicator Survey, the 1994 Fertility and Birth Spacing Survey, the 1995 and 2000 censuses
23

and the 2000 and 2005 Lao Reproductive Health Surveys. These were smoothed using
weighted cubic smoothing splines to produce single initial point estimates of the average 1 q0
and 5 q0 over each five-year interval during the period of reconstruction. Intercensal survival
estimates were not used.
There are no direct estimates of mortality over age five. Initial estimates for these older
ages were derived using the the Coale and Demeny (1983) West (CD West) family of model
life tables in the following way. For each five year period, two CD West life tables were
found; one with 1 q0 closest to that produced by the smoothing procedure and one with 5 q0
closest. Within each pair, the e0 s in these two tables were averaged. Age-specific survival
proportions calculated from the CD West table with e0 closest to this average were then
taken as the initial estimates of mortality at all ages. The elicited relative error of these
initial point estimates was set to 10 percent.
Migration There is not much information about migration. Political upheaval resulted in
significant levels of migration between 1975 and 1985 as refugees left the country. By 1985,
however, these flows had become small (U.S. Department of State 2011). No information
about the age pattern or sex distribution is available. To model this, we set initial point
estimates to zero for all ages and time periods, but used a large elicited relative error of 20
percent.
B.1.2

Results

Census-based initial estimates and posterior quantiles for the size of the Laos female population are given in Table B.1. Between 1985 and 2005, the posterior median estimate increased
from 1.83 to 2.96 million, an average annual growth rate of 2.4 percent. Figure 1 in the article summarizes the posterior distributions of TFR, total net number of migrants, e0 and
under-five mortality.

TFR Total fertility rate declined over the period of reconstruction, from (5.99, 6.78) to
(3.66, 4.08). The mean half-width of the posterior 95 percent Bayesian confidence intervals
is 0.32 children.
For most of the years, the posterior median moved away from the initial estimates toward
the WPP 2010 estimates. No information about intercensal population changes was used
in our initial estimates, whereas both our posterior and WPP 2010 do use this information.
The 95 percent Bayesian confidence interval contains the WPP 2010 estimate in all five-year
periods except 1995–1999 where our estimate is (4.97, 5.61) compared with 4.81 in WPP
2010. These results also show that the posterior is not constrained to lie within the initial
estimate (see the posterior intervals for the 1990–1994 and 2000–2004).
Age-specific Fertility Rates The posterior intervals for age-specific fertility rates are
wider than the prior intervals in all years and ages (Figure B.1). This is quite feasible under
the statistical model and is a consequence of there being very little information about the
age pattern of fertility in the other parameters.
Net Number of Migrants The total net number of migrants changed from (−4,975,
4,341) women over the period 1985–1989 to (−15,319, 65) over 2000–2004. The 95 percent
posterior intervals have a mean half-width of 6,099 and are considerably more narrow than
the corresponding initial estimate intervals (mean half width 142,777). In this case, the only
information about migration comes from intercensal changes that are not accounted for by
fertility and mortality.
Life Expectancy at Birth Female life expectancy at birth increased consistently between
1985 and 2005, from (51.6, 53.1) years over the period 1985–1989 to (64.5, 65.4) over the period 2000–2004. The mean half-width of the intervals over the whole period of reconstruction
is 0.61 years. The mean trend in the posterior agrees broadly with WPP 2010 but implies
a lower e0 over the 1985–1989 and 1995–1999 periods and a higher e0 over the 2000–2004
period.
Under-five Mortality Under-five mortality decreased consistently over the period of reconstruction from (145, 167) deaths per 1,000 live births over 1985–1989 to (65.5, 76.5) over
2000–2004. The latter of these contains the WPP 2010 estimate of 75. Our 95 percent
interval for 1995–1999 is (94.5, 110) which also contains the WPP 2010 estimate of 94. The
mean half-width of the intervals is 8.19.

Sri Lanka
Data and Initial Estimates

Population Counts Censuses were conducted in Sri Lanka in 1953, 1963, 1971, 1981
and 2001 and so we reconstruct the female population between 1953 and 2001. We took
population counts from WPP 2010 which were adjusted to account for underenumeration
and set the elicited relative error to 10 percent.
Fertility Data on age-specific fertility rates for Sri Lanka came from data on children ever
born classified by age of mother collected in the 1971 census, maternity history and children
ever born data from the 1975 Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey (WFS), the 1987, 1993 and
2000 Sri Lanka DHSs, maternity history data from the 2006–07 Sri Lanka DHS and recent
births registered by the Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka (DCS Sri Lanka)
between 1972 and 2006.
A single series of age-specific initial estimates was derived in a manner similar to that used
for Laos, although at the level of TFR we used loess (Cleveland et al. 1992; Cleveland 1979)
to smooth multiple data points across time-period. Elicited relative error for this parameter
was set at 10 percent.
Mortality Official estimates of infant and child mortality from DCS Sri Lanka were adjusted upward to improve consistency with UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality
Estimation (IGME 2010) estimates. These were based on maternity histories and children
ever born data from the 1975 Sri Lanka WFS, the 1987, 1993, 2000 and 2006 Sri Lanka DHS
and the 1971 Census, assuming that the age pattern of mortality followed that in the CoaleDemeny West model life table (Coale, Demeny, & Vaughan 1983). These estimates were
combined with registered deaths and population estimates to produce abridged national life
tables at five yearly intervals over the period of reconstruction. Age specific survival proportions were calculated from these. Elicited relative error for this parameter was set at 10
percent.
Migration DCS Sri Lanka releases counts of international arrivals and departures which
provide some information about international migration (e.g., Department of Census and
Statistics, Sri Lanka [DCS Sri Lanka] 2010). However, their accuracy as estimates of actual
net migration was difficult to determine and counts by age were not available for most of the
period of reconstruction. Luther et al. (1987) provide age-specific estimates for the periods
1971–1975 and 1976–1980 using census data as well as information about vital rates. Their
results are not suitable as a basis for initial estimates because they were derived, in part,
27

from census counts. Since intercensal changes are automatically accounted for by Bayesian
reconstruction, incorporating census information into initial estimates would result in using
the data twice and underestimate posterior uncertainty. Therefore, we used the same default
initial estimate as for Laos and use Luther et al.’s (1987) results for comparison.

TFR Fertility changed markedly in Sri Lanka over the fifty years between 1951 and 2000.
Our posterior estimates suggest that TFR declined from (5.11, 5.71) births per woman to
(2.07, 2.23). The mean half-width of the posterior intervals is 0.189 children.
Our initial point estimates of TFR for the periods 1951–1956 and 1956–1961 were 5.01
and 5.03, respectively, much lower than the corresponding medians of the posterior; 5.42 and
5.09 respectively. The WPP 2010 estimate is 5.8 births for both of the periods 1950–1954
and 1955-1959. This suggests that the sources upon which the initial estimates were based
are inconsistent with intercensal changes in the number of births. Our posterior estimates
and those of the WPP 2010 account for this by adjusting the estimates upward over this ten
year period.
28

Net Number of Migrants The total net number of migrants changed from (−5,062,
14,517) during 1951–1955 to (−56,691, 7,526) between 1996 and 2001. The mean half-width
of the posterior 95 percent intervals is 109,665.
Our results indicate net out-migration from 1971 to 2001 but there is not enough information to determine the direction of the flow between 1951 and 1970. There is close agreement
between our results and those of Luther et al. (1987). They estimated net migration from
intercensal changes after accounting for changes due to fertility and mortality; their method
does not provide an estimate of uncertainty.
Life Expectancy at Birth Female life expectancy at birth increased between 1951 and
2001, from (54.9, 57.2) years to (72.9, 73.8). The mean half-width of the posterior 95
percent confidence intervals is 0.707 years. Our results are in close agreement with WPP
2010 estimates in all five-year periods except 1996–2000. The WPP 2010 estimate for 1995–
1999 is 72.7, 0.3 years below the lower bound of our 95 percent interval for 1996–2000.
Under-five Mortality Under-five mortality decreased from (139, 171) deaths per 1,000
live births over 1951–1955 to (18.2, 23.2) over 1996–2001. The mean half-widths of the
posterior intervals is 7,822. The WPP 2010 estimate of under five mortality over 1995–1999
is similar at 21 deaths per 1,000 live births.

New Zealand
Data and Initial Estimates

Population Counts National censuses were conducted every five years from 1961 to 2001.
We took the counts published in WPP 2010 and interpolated them to the census years on the
growth rate scale. PESs were used to estimate undercount in the 1996 and 2001 censuses. The
ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the undercount of total population as estimated
by these surveys are (1.4, 1.8) and (1.9, 2.5) percentage points for 1996 and 2001 respectively
(Statistics New Zealand 2001). Since PESs were not conducted for earlier censuses, we took
a conservative approach to determining the distributions of the initial estimates and made
them symmetric about the census counts. Elicited relative error was set at 2.5 percent under
the assumption that undercount in 2001 is an upper bound on the measurement error for all
previous censuses back to 1961.
Fertility Initial estimates of fertility rates were calculated from published age-specific fertility rates (Statistics New Zealand 2011a) and numbers of births (Statistics New Zealand 2012)
by age-group of mother by year. The denominators of the rates were inferred from these two
29

tables. Age-specific rates for the five-year periods 1961–1965, . . . , 2001–2005 were calculated
by binning the number of births and person-years lived into the five-year periods, summing
and taking ratios.
In New Zealand, all births are recorded in a centralized birth register. Any inaccuracies
are primarily due to late registrations; that is, registrations made more than two years after the birth. These are excluded from the data used to estimate fertility. However, it is
estimated that these late registrations make up no more than one percent of all eventually
registered births (Statistics New Zealand 2010a). The denominators for the published birth
rates are based on estimated population counts based primarily on census data. Any inaccuracy in these counts is likely to be small and in the form of an undercount which would
have an effect on the estimated rates opposite to that caused by an undercount of births.
Consequently, the initial estimates of fertility rates were deemed to have a very high level of
reliability relative to the two previous case studies and elicited relative error was set to one
percent.
Mortality Initial estimates for survival proportions were calculated from New Zealand
life tables (Statistics New Zealand 2011b). These are tabulated for the periods 1960–1962,
. . . , 2000–2002. To derive estimates for the five-year projection intervals 1961–1965, 1966–
1970, . . . , 2001–2005, tabulated mortality rates for periods bracketing those of interest were
linearly interpolated.
Mortality information contained within these tables comes from the central death register.
This register achieved high coverage of the whole population (including New Zealand M¯aori)
from 1960 onward. Any inaccuracies are likely to be concentrated at very young ages, but
these became negligible from 1961 (Statistics New Zealand 2006). Therefore, as with fertility,
initial estimates of survival were deemed to be highly reliable and elicited relative error was
set to one percent.
Migration Since New Zealand is an island nation with a well resourced official statistics
system, information about international migration is potentially quite reliable relative to
other countries. The basis of our initial estimates of international migration are counts
of PLT migrants taken from arrivals and departures cards required of all travelers. PLT
migrants are those intending to remain present/absent for at least 12 months.(Statistics
New Zealand 2010b).
Net numbers of PLT migrants by five-year age group and sex for single years between 1979
and 2006 were taken from Statistics New Zealand (2010c). Only total counts are available by
single year between 1961 and 1979 (Statistics New Zealand 2010d). These were disaggregated

30

into age-specific female counts by multiplying the total counts by the 1979 age and sex
pattern. Were counts by sex and age not available, a model age/sex pattern (e.g., Rogers &
Castro 1981) could have been used. The resulting set of net counts for females by five-year
age group, single years, were then summed over the five-year periods 1961–1965, 1966–1970,
. . . , 2001–2005 and converted into average annual proportions by dividing by five times the
population counts described above.
The largest source of error in these data as estimates of international migration is the
discrepancy between stated and actual intentions. Some of those classified as PLT migrants
according to their stated intentions may leave or return earlier than twelve months, some of
those classified as short term migrants may leave or return later. This effect is not negligible
and to reflect its effect on the initial estimates we set the elicited relative error of this
parameter to five percent. This is lower than the elicited error in migration for Laos and Sri
Lanka, but much higher than the error for New Zealand fertility and survival estimates.

TFR Fertility declined steeply in New Zealand. Our posterior estimates for TFR over the
1961–1965 period are (3.83, 3.93) births per woman, declining to (1.94, 1.98) over 2001–
2006. The mean half-width of the 95 percent posterior Bayesian confidence intervals is 0.03
children. Our estimates are broadly similar to those in WPP 2010.
31

Net Number of Migrants We estimate that the total net number of migrants changed
from (13,576, 35,252) during 1961–1965 to (53,418, 84,553) during 2001–2006. The mean
half-width of the posterior 95 percent intervals is 12,872. This is much more narrow than the
posterior intervals for both Laos and Sri Lanka, reflecting the relatively reliable migration
information used to form the initial estimates.
Life Expectancy at Birth Female life expectancy at birth increased between 1961 and
2001, from (73.99, 74.06) years to (81.55, 81.65). The mean half-width of the posterior 95
percent confidence intervals is 0.04 years. Our results are broadly comparable with those in
WPP 2010.
Under-five Mortality Under-five mortality decreased from (20.4, 21.2) deaths per 1,000
live births over 1961–1965 to (7.08, 7.36) over 1996–2001. The mean half-widths of the
posterior intervals is 0.244. The WPP 2010 estimates of under five mortality over 1995–
1999, and 2000–2005 (7 and 6 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively) are lower. However,
at such small numbers it is possible that some of this discrepancy is due to rounding; the
WPP 2010 results appear to be rounded to the nearest whole number.
