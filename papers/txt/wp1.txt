Abstract

Statistical methods have had a successful half-century in sociology, contributing to a greatly
improved standard of scientic rigor in the discipline. I identify three overlapping postwar
generations of statistical methods in sociology, based on the kinds of data they address. The
rst generation, which started in the late 1940s, deals with cross-tabulations, and focuses
on measures of association and loglinear models, perhaps the area of statistics to which
sociology has contributed the most. The second generation, which began in the 1960s, deals
with unit-level survey data, and focuses on LISREL-type causal models and event history
analysis. The third generation, starting to emerge in the late 1980s, deals with data that are
neither cross-tabulations nor data matrices, either because they have a dierent form, such
as texts or narratives, or because dependence is a crucial aspect, as with spatial or social
network data. There are many new challenges and the area is ripe for statistical research;
several major institutions have recently launched new initiatives in statistics and the social
sciences.

Introduction

Sociology is the scientic study of modern industrial society. Example questions include:
What determines how well people succeed in life, occupationally and otherwise? What
factors aect variations in crime rates between dierent countries, cities and neighborhoods?
What are the causes of the increase in divorce rates in the past generation in the U.S.?
What are the main factors driving fertility decline in developing countries? Why have social
revolutions been successful in some countries but not in others?
The roots of sociology go back to the mid 19th century and to seminal work by Auguste
Comte, Karl Marx, Max Weber and Emile Durkheim on the kind of society newly emerging
from the industrial revolution. Sociology has used quantitative methods and data from the
beginning, but before World War II the data tended to be fragmentary and the statistical
methods simple and descriptive.
Since then, the data available have grown in complexity, and statistical methods have
been developed to deal with them, with the sociologists themselves often leading the way
(Clogg 1992). The trend has been towards more rigorous formulation of hypotheses, larger
and more detailed data sets, statistical models growing in complexity to match the data,
and a higher level of statistical analysis in the major sociological journals.
Statistical methods have had a successful half-century in sociology, contributing to a
greatly improved standard of scientic rigor in the discipline. Sociology has made use of a
wide variety of statistical methods and models, but I will focus here on the ones developed
by sociologists, motivated by sociological problems, or rst published in sociological journals.
I will distinguish three postwar generations of statistical methods in sociology, each dened
by the kind of data it addresses. The rst generation of methods, starting after World War
II, deals with cross-tabulations of counts from surveys and censuses by a small number of
discrete variables such as sex, age group and occupational category; social mobility tables
provide a canonical example. Schuessler (1980) is a survey that largely reects this rstgeneration work.
The second generation, starting in the early 1960s, deals with unit-level data from surveys that include many variables. This generation was galvanized by Blau and Duncan's
(1967) highly inuential book, The American Occupational Structure, and by the establishment of Sociological Methodology in 1969 and Sociological Methods and Research in 1972 as
publication outlets. These developments marked the coming of age of research on quantitative methodology in sociology. The third generation of methods, starting in the late 1980s,
1

deals with data that are not usually thought of as cross-tabulations or data matrices, either
because the data take dierent forms, such as texts or narratives, or because dependence is
a crucial aspect. These generations do not have clear starting points and all remain active
today; like real generations, they overlap.
Today, much sociological research is based on the reanalysis of large high-quality survey
sample datasets, usually collected with public funds and publicly available to researchers,
with typical sample sizes in the range 5,000{20,000. This has opened the way to easy
replication of results and has helped to produce standards of scientic rigor in sociology
comparable to those in many of the natural sciences. Social statistics is expanding rapidly
as a research area, and several major institutions have recently launched initiatives in this
area.

2.1

The First Generation: Cross-Tabulations
Categorical Data Analysis

Initially, much of the data that quantitative sociologists had to work with came in the form
of cross-classied tables, and so it is not surprising that this is perhaps the area of statistics
to which sociology has contributed the most. A canonical example has been the analysis of
social mobility tables, two-way tables of father's against respondent's occupational category;
typically the number of categories used is between ve and 17.
At rst the focus was on measures of association, or mobility indices as they were called
in the social mobility context (Glass 1954; Rogo 1953), but these indices failed to do the
job of separating structural mobility from exchange (or circulation) mobility. It was Birch
(1963) who proposed the loglinear model for the observed counts fxij g, given by
log(E [xij ]) = u + u1(i) + u2(j ) + u12(ij ) ;

(1)

where i indexes rows and j columns, u1(i) and u2(j ) are the main eects for the rows and
columns, and u12(ij ) is the interaction term, measuring departures from independence. The
diÆculty with model (1) for social mobility and similar tables is that the number of parameters is too large for inference and interpretation; for example in the U.S. data sets 17
categories were used, so the interaction term involves 162 = 256 parameters.
A successful general approach to modeling the interaction term parsimoniously is the

association model of Duncan (1979) and Goodman (1979):

u12(ij ) =

XK kik jk + iÆ(i; j);
( ) ( )

k=1

(2)

where Æ (i; j ) = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. In (2), i(k) is the score for the ith row on
the kth scoring dimension, and j(k) is the corresponding score for the j th column; these
can be either specied in advance or estimated from the data. The last term allows a
dierent strength of association on the diagonal. (The model (2) is unidentied as written;
various identifying constraints are possible.) In most applications to date, K = 1. Goodman
(1979) initially derived this model as a way of describing association in terms of local odds
ratios. Goodman (1985) has shown that this model is closely related to canonical correlations
and to correspondence analysis (Benzecri 1973), and provides an inferential framework for
these methodologies. Table 1 shows the actual counts for a reduced version of the most
extensive U.S. social mobility study, and the tted values from an association model; the
model accounts for 99.6% of the association in the table and its success is evident.
Hout (1984) extended the range of application of these models by modeling the scores
and diagonal terms in (2) as sums or products of covariates, such as characteristics of the
occupational categories in question; this is an extension of Birch's (1965) linear-by-linear
interaction model. This has led to important discoveries, including Hout's (1988) nding
that social mobility is on the increase in the U.S. Biblarz and Raftery (1993) adapted Hout's
models to higher dimensional tables to study social mobility in nonintact families, nding
3

that occupational resemblance is weaker there than in intact families. From sociology, these
ideas have diused to other disciplines, such as epidemiology (Becker 1989).
An appealing alternative formulation of the basic ideas underlying (1) and (2) is in terms
of marginal distributions rather than the main eects in (1). The resulting marginal models
specify a model for the marginal distributions and a model for the odds ratios, and this
implies a model for the joint distribution that is not loglinear (Lang and Agresti 1994;
Becker 1994; Becker and Yang 1998).
An alternative approach that answers dierent questions is the latent class model (Lazarsfeld 1950; Goodman 1974). This represents the distribution of counts as a nite mixture of
distributions in each of which the dierent variables are independent. An interesting recent
application to criminology is by Roeder, Lynch and Nagin (1999).
2.2

Hypothesis Testing and Model Selection

Sociologists often have sample sizes in the thousands, and so they came up early and hard
against the problem that standard P -values can indicate rejection of null hypotheses in large
samples, even when the null model seems reasonable theoretically and inspection of the
data fails to reveal any striking discrepancies with it. The problem is compounded by the
fact that there are often many models rather than just the two envisaged by signicance
tests, and by the need to use stepwise or other multiple comparison methods for model
selection (e.g. Goodman 1971). By the early 1980s, some sociologists were dealing with this
problem by ignoring the results of P -value-based tests when they seemed counterintuitive
and by basing model selection instead on theoretical considerations and informal assessment
of discrepancies between model and data (e.g. Fienberg and Mason 1979; Hout 1983, 1984;
Grusky and Hauser 1984).
Then it was pointed out that this problem could be alleviated by basing model selection
instead on Bayes factors (Raftery 1986), and that this can be simply approximated for
loglinear models by preferring a model if BIC = Deviance (Degrees of freedom) log(n), is
smaller (Schwarz 1978). For nested hypotheses, this can be viewed as dening a signicance
level for a test that decreases automatically with sample size. Since then, this approach has
been used in many sociological applications of loglinear models. Kass and Wasserman (1995)
showed that the approximation is quite accurate if the Bayesian prior used for the model
parameters is a unit information prior, and Raftery (1995) indicated how the methodology
can be extended to a range of other models. Weakliem (1999) criticized the use of BIC on
the grounds that the unit information prior to which it corresponds may be too diuse in
4

practice. This points towards using Bayes factors based on priors that reect the actual
information available; this is easy to do for loglinear and other generalized linear models
(Raftery 1996).
3

The Second Generation: Unit-Level Survey Data

The second generation of statistical models responded to the availability of unit-level survey
data in the form of large data matrices of independent cases. The methods that have proved
successful for answering questions about such data have mostly been based on the linear
regression model and its extensions to path models, structural equation models, generalized
linear models and event history models. For questions about the distribution of variables
rather about than their predicted value, however, nonparametric methods have proven useful
(Morris, Bernhardt and Handcock 1994; Handcock and Morris 1998).
3.1

Measuring Occupational Status

Occupational status is an important concept in sociology and developing a useful continuous
measure of it was a signal achievement of the eld. Initially, the status of an occupation
was equated with its perceived prestige, as measured in surveys. However, surveys could
measure the prestige of only a small number of the 800 or so occupations identied in the
Census. To ll in the missing prestige scores, Duncan (1961) regressed the prestige scores
for the occupations for which they were available on measures of the average education and
average income of incumbents of the occupation. He found that the predictions were very
good (R2 = 0:91), and that the two predictors were about equally weighted. Based on
this, he created a predicted prestige score for all occupations, which became known as the
Duncan Socioeconomic Index (SEI); the SEI later turned out to be a better predictor of
various social outcomes than the prestige scores themselves. Duncan's initial work has been
updated several times (Hauser and Warren 1997).
In much social research, particularly in economics, current income is used as a predictor
of social outcomes, but there are good reasons to prefer occupational status. It has proven
to be a good predictor of many social outcomes. Jobs and occupations can be measured
accurately, in contrast to income or wealth, whose measurement is plagued by problems of
refusal, recall and reliability. Also, occupational status is more stable over time than income,
both within careers and between generations. This suggests that occupational status may
actually be a better indicator of long-term or permanent income than current income itself.

deviations. All the variables have been centered and scaled. Source: Blau and Duncan
(1967).
The status of occupations tends to be fairly constant both in time and across countries
(Treiman 1977).
3.2

The Many Uses of Structual Equation Models

Figure 1 shows the basic path model of occupational
attainment at the heart of Blau and Duncan (1967); see Duncan (1966). Wright (1921)
introduced path analysis, and Blalock (1964) gave it a causal interpretation in a social
science context. See Freedman (1987) and Sobel (1998) for critique and discussion, and
Abbott (1998), Pearl (1998) and Sobel (2000) for histories of causality in social science.
Often, variables of interest in a causal model are not observed directly, but other variables
are observed that can be viewed as measurements of the variables, or \constructs" of interest,
such as prejudice, alienation, conservatism, self-esteem, discrimination, motivation or ability.
Joreskog (1973) dealt with this by maximum likelihood estimation of a structural equation
model with latent variables; this is sometimes called a LISREL model, from the name of
Joreskog's software. A typical model of this kind is shown in Figure 2; the goal of the
analysis is testing and estimating the strength of the relationship between the unobserved

latent variables represented by the thick arrow. Diagrams such as Figures 1 and 2 have
proven useful to sociologists for specifying theories and hypotheses and for building causal
models.
The LISREL framework has been extended and used ingeniously for purposes beyond
those for which it was originally intended. Muthen (1983) extended it to categorical variables, and Muthen (1997) showed how it can be used to represent longitudinal data, growth
curve models, and multilevel data. Kuo and Hauser (1996) used data on siblings to control
for unobserved family eects on socioeconomic outcomes, and cast the resulting random
eects model in a LISREL framework. Warren, LePore and Mare (1998) considered the relationship between the number of hours high school students work and their grades; a common
assumption might be that working many hours tends to depress grades. They found that,
while number of hours and grades do indeed tend to covary (negatively), the causal direction
is the opposite: low grades leads to many hours worked, rather than the other way round.
The advent of graphical Markov models (Spiegelhalter et al. 1993), specied by conditional independencies rather than by regression-like relationships, is important for the analysis of multivariate dependencies, although they can seem less interpretable to sociologists.
The relationship between these and structural equation models has begun to be understood
(Spirtes et al. 1998). Also, the LISREL model seems ideally suited to Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods (Gilks et al. 1996), and this is likely to permit useful extensions of
the framework (Raftery 1991; Arminger 1998; Scheines, Hoijtink and Boomsma 1999).

3.3

Event History Analysis

Unit-level survey data often include or allow the reconstruction of life histories. These include
the times of crucial events such as marriages, divorces, births, commitals to and releases from
prison, job changes, or going on or o welfare.
The analysis of factors inuencing the time to a single event such as death was revolutionized by the introduction of the Cox (1972) proportional hazards model. Tuma and
Hannan (1984) generalized this approach to allow for repeated events, for multiple types
of events, such as marriages and divorces, and for events consisting of movement between
dierent types of states, such as dierent job categories.
Uses of the Cox model in medecine have tended to treat the baseline hazard nonparametrically, but in social science it has sometimes been found useful to model it parametrically.
For example, Yamaguchi (1992) analyzed permanent employment in Japan where the surviving fraction (those who never change jobs) and its determinants are of key interest; he found
that covariates were associated both with the timing of job change and with the surviving
fraction.
Social science event history data are often recorded in discrete time, e.g. by year, either
because events tend to happen at particular times of year (e.g. graduating), or because of
measurement constraints. As a result, discrete-time event history models have been popular
(Allison 1982; Xie 1994), and in some ways are easier to handle than their continuoustime analogues. Ways of dealing with multilevel event history data, smoothly time-varying
covariates and other complications have been introduced in this context (e.g. Raftery, Lewis
and Aghajanian 1995; Fahrmeir and Knorr-Held 1997).
One problem with social science event history data is that dropping out can be related to
the event of interest. For example, people may tend to leave a study shortly before a divorce,
which will play havoc with estimation of divorce rates. The problem seems almost insoluble
at rst sight, but Hill (1997) produced an elegant solution using the Shared Unmeasured
Risk Factor (SURF) model of Hill, Axinn and Thornton (1993). The basic trick is to observe
that, although one does not know which of the people who dropped out actually got divorced
soon afterwards, one can estimate which ones were most at risk of divorcing.

The Third Generation: New Data, New Challenges,
New Methods

4.1

Social Networks and Spatial Data

Social networks consist of sets of pairwise connections, such as friendships between adolescents, sexual relationships between adults, or political alliances and patterns of marriage
between social groups. The analysis of data about such networks has a long history (Wasserman and Faust 1994). Frank and Strauss (1986) developed formal statistical models for such
networks related to the Markov random eld models used in Bayesian image analysis, and
derived using the Hammsersley-Cliord theorem (Besag 1974). This has led to the promising
\p " class of models for social networks (Wasserman and Pattison 1996).
Methods for the analysis of social networks have focused mostly on small data sets with
complete data. In practical applications, however, such as the eect of sexual network
patterns on the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (Morris 1997), the data tend to be
large and very incomplete, and current methods are somewhat at a loss. This is the stage that
pedigree analysis in statistical genetics was at some years ago, but the use of likelihood and
MCMC methods have led to major progress since then (Thompson 1998). Social networks
are more complex than pedigrees in one way, because pedigrees tend to have a tree structure,
while social networks often have cycles, but progress does seem possible.
Most social data are spatial, but this fact has been largely ignored in sociological research.
A major exception is Massey and Denton's (1993) study of residential segregation by race,
reviving a much older sociological tradition of spatial analysis in American society (e.g.
Duncan and Duncan 1957). More recently, the eld of research on fertility and contraception
in Asia (several major projects focused on China, Thailand and Nepal) has been making
fruitful use of satellite image and Geographic Information System (GIS) data (e.g. Entwisle
et al. 1997). More extensive use of spatial statistics in sociology seems likely.
4.2

Textual Data

In its rawest form, a great deal of sociological data is textual, e.g. interviews, answers to
open-ended questions in surveys, enthnographic accounts. How to analyze such data and
draw inference from it is a largely open question. Eorts at formal analysis have focused
on standard content analysis, consisting mainly of counting words in the text in dierent
ways. It seems likely that using the context in which words and clauses appear would yield
9

better results. Promising recent eorts to do just this include Carley's (1993) map analysis,
Franzosi's (1994) set theoretic approach, and Roberts's (1997) generic semantic grammar;
but the surface has only been scratched. The human mind is very good at analyzing individual texts, but computers are not, at least as yet; in this way the analysis of textual
data may be like other problems such as image analysis and speech recognition. A similar
challenge is faced on a massive scale by information retrieval for the Web (Jones and Willett
1997), where most search engines are based on simple content analysis methods. The more
contextual methods being developed in sociology might be useful in this area also.
Singer et al (1998) have made an intriguing use of textual data analysis, blending quantitative and qualitative approaches. They took a standard unit-level data set with over 250
variables per person, and converted them into written \biographies". They then examined
the biographies for common features, and thinned them to more generic descriptions.
4.3

Narrative and Sequence Analysis

Life histories are typically analyzed by reducing them to variables and doing regression and
multivariate analysis, or by event history analysis. Abbott and Hrycak (1990) argued that
these standard approaches obscure vital aspects of a life history (such as a professional
career) that emerge when it is considered as a whole. They proposed viewing life histories
of this kind as analogous to DNA or protein sequences, using optimal alignment methods
adapted from molecular biology (Sanko and Kruskal 1983), followed up by cluster analysis,
to detect patterns common to groups of careers. Stovel, Savage and Bearman (1996) used
these methods to describe changes in career systems at Lloyds Banks over the past century.
Subsequently, Dijkstra and Taris (1995) extended the ideas to include independent variables, and Abbott and Barman (1997) applied the Gibbs sampling sequence detection method
of Lawrence et al (1993), originally also developed for microbiology; this seems to work very
well. The approach is interesting, and there are many open statistical questions.
4.4

Simulation Models

Another way to represent a social process in more detail is via a macro- or microsimulation
model. Such models are often deterministic and quite complicated, representing systems
by dierent compartments that interact, and each compartment by a set of dierential or
dierence equations. They have been used, for example, to explore the implications of
dierent theories about how domestic politics and war interact (Hanneman, Collins and
10

Mordt 1995), the social dynamics of collective action (Kim and Bearman 1997), and the role
of sexual networks in the spread of HIV (Morris 1997 and references therein).
A diÆculty with such models is that ways of estimating the many parameters involved, of
assessing the t of the model, and of comparing competing models are not well established;
all this tends to be done by informal trial and error. Methods being developed to put
inference for such models on a solid statistical footing in other disciplines may prove helpful
in sociology as well (Guttorp and Walden 1987; Raftery, Givens and Zeh 1995; Poole and
Raftery 1998).
4.5

Macrosociology

Macrosociology deals with large entities, such as states and their interactions. As a result,
the number of cases tends to be small, and the use of standard statistical methods such as
regression is diÆcult. This was pointed out trenchantly by Ragin (1987) in an inuential
book. His own proposed alternative, Qualitative Comparative Analysis, seems unsatisfactory
because it does not allow for variability of any kind, and so is sensitive to small changes in
the data and in the way the method is applied (Lieberson 1994).
One solution to the problem is to obtain an at least moderately large sample size, as
Bollen and Appold (1993) were able to do, for example. Often, however, this is not possible,
so this is not a general solution. Another approach is to use standard regression-type models,
but to do Bayesian estimation with strong prior information if available, which it often is
from the practice, common in this area, of analyzing specic cases in great detail (Western
and Jackman 1994). Bayes factors may also help, as they tend to be less stringent than
standard signicance tests in small samples and allow a calibrated assessment of evidence
rather than forcing the rejection or acceptance of a hypothesis (Kass and Raftery 1995).
They also provide a way of accounting for model uncertainty, which can be quite large in
this context (Western 1996).

Discussion

Statistical methodology has had a successful half-century in sociology, leading the way in
providing models for cross-classications, and developing well-adapted methods for unit-level
datasets. This has contributed to the greatly improved level of scientic rigor in sociology
today.
11

New kinds of data and new challenges abound, and the area is ripe for statistical research. Several major institutions are launching initiatives in the area. The University of
Washington has just established a new Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, UCLA's
new Statistics Department grew out of social statistics, and there are other initiatives at
the University of Michigan, Columbia University, UC Santa Barbara, and the universities in
North Carolina's Research Triangle. Harvard's new Center for Basic Research in the Social
Sciences also emphasizes social statistics. They all join the most successful eort of this kind
to date, the Social Statistics Department at the University of Southampton.
