The literature on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) determinants is remarkably diverse in terms of
competing theories and empirical results. We utilize Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to resolve the
model uncertainty that surrounds the validity of the competing FDI theories. Since the structure of existing
FDI data is known to induce selection bias, we extend BMA theory to HeckitBMA to address model
uncertainty in the presence of selection bias. We then show that more than half of the previously suggested
FDI determinants are no longer robust and highlight theories that receive support from the data. In
addition, our selection approach allows us to highlight that the determinants of margins of FDI (intensive
and extensive) differ profoundly in the data, while FDI theories do not usually model this aspect explicitly.

Introduction

Global FDI flows increased tenfold, or by about $2 trillion, from 1990 to 2008
(UNCTAD, 2009), nevertheless a consensus on robust FDI determinants is still elusive.
While remarkably diverse FDI theories have motivated a wide range of potential FDI
determinants, empirical FDI approaches commonly juxtapose only limited subsets of
candidate regressors.1 In light of this model uncertainty, it comes as no surprise that FDI
coefficient estimates are well known to be ambiguous and at times contradictory. In the
most comprehensive survey to date, Blonigen (2005) summarizes the FDI model
uncertainty succinctly: “in the final analysis, the empirical literature on determinants of
FDI is still young enough that most hypotheses are still up for grabs.”
Using Extreme Bound Analysis, Chakrabarti (2001) provided the first systematic
evidence of the fragility of FDI determinants.2 The ad hoc Extreme Bound approach has
since been superseded by statistical theory, which developed Bayesian Model Averaging
(BMA) to account for model uncertainty as part of the estimation procedure (Raftery,
1995). The BMA approach is important since Berger and Sellke (1987) have shown that
conventional sensitivity analyses overstate significance and confidence intervals in the
absence of a full account of model uncertainty. When model uncertainty is not addressed
comprehensively, it remains unclear whether a statistically significant FDI determinant
remains relevant when alternative specifications/theories are considered. BMA
methodology is thus tailor-made to examine the large set of candidate regressors that
have been proposed as FDI determinants by alternative FDI theories.
An added complication in FDI empirics is that even the most comprehensive FDI
datasets contain large sections of missing data. Selection bias may thus contaminate
coefficient estimates, since it is unclear whether the nature of FDI forces the lion’s share
of investment to occur among OECD countries, or whether this observed FDI pattern is

1

For example, Blonigen and Piger (2011) note that three key empirical FDI studies include no fewer than
22 different FDI determinants, but with little overlap. Baltagi et al. (2007) include a table that juxtaposes 4
alternative FDI theories that motivate 15 different FDI determinants.

Leamer (1978) suggested Extreme Bound Analysis as an ad hoc sensitivity analysis in the presence of
model uncertainty. EBA has been criticized for its lack of statistical foundations. His implementation also
restricted Chakrabarti (2001) to a limited number of models.

an artifact of systematically missing observations.3 To address both model uncertainty
and selection bias we introduce HeckitBMA, which extends the statistical foundations of
BMA to include Heckman’s (1979) selection bias procedure.
HeckitBMA reveals not only the determinants of the intensive and extensive
margins of FDI (“the volume of investment flows” and “the decision to invest”,
respectively), it also permits us to estimate FDI determinants without having to constrain
parameter estimates to be identical across both margins. There is no reason to suspect that
the margins of FDI should feature identical determinants, or that the same determinant
has the identical impact on both margins. Our selection criterion is based on Razin,
Rubinstein and Sadka (2004), who note that FDI involves fixed costs that give rise to
two-part decisions: a marginal productivity condition that determines how much to invest,
and a total profitability condition that indicates whether or not to invest abroad. Previous
studies have confirmed the relevance of such FDI fixed costs.4
Our results show that the impact of model uncertainty on FDI estimates is
substantial and that the Heckman selection methodology is necessary. Without
controlling for model uncertainty, the conventional Heckit procedure suggests nearly
twice as many FDI determinants as HeckitBMA at the extensive margin and 12
additional regressors (33%) at the intensive margin. This is not surprising, since Heckit is
not designed to consider models associated with alternative theories. Instead, HeckitBMA
discovers much more parsimonious models of FDI that score decisively better in terms of
joint likelihoods or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).
According to HeckitBMA, the intensive margin of FDI is influenced by country
characteristics such as common history/language, and the absence of corruption and
religious/internal

determinants of greater FDI flows at the intensive margin include common

This FDI data issue has been well documented as early as Soto (2000). OECD data covers FDI activity
among OECD countries comprehensively, but OECD/Non-OECD coverage is spotty and Non-OECD
country-pairs are nonexistent.

in the host and source countries. In addition, market potential, lower growth,
development, and productivity in host countries reduce FDI flows.
In stark contrast, the decision to invest has markedly fewer determinants. Country
characteristics that affect the extensive margin are common colonial history/borders, as
well as the lack of religious tension in the host and lower corruption in source countries.
Economic factors that increase the likelihood of FDI investment include host and source
country market size, as well as the hosts market potential and level of development.
Greater source country productivity, taxation, or economic tensions decrease the
likelihood that FDI is undertaken.
The importance of these FDI determinants is best appreciated once we relate the
individual regressors back to specific FDI theories. We find only mixed support for
horizontal or export platform FDI theories (Markusen, 1984). Trade agreements and
currency unions do not encourage FDI across the board but only in specific instances
(e.g., dollarization and APEC membership), while host market potential exerts a decisive
effect on FDI that runs contrary to the theory prediction. As in Blonigen et al. (2007), we
find that a host’s proximity to large markets results in less FDI – as large, proximate
markets divert FDI from a potential small host, perhaps to take advantage of scale
economies. Vertical FDI theory (Helpman, 1984) is not strongly supported since FDI is
sensitive to higher levels of development and contrary to the knowledge-capital model
that unified the horizontal and vertical theories (Markusen et al., 1996 and Markusen,
1997), we find no evidence that educational differences exert robust effects on either the
intensive or extensive margins. HeckitBMA does confirm the Razin et al. (2007a)
hypothesis that productivity is a crucial determinant of the decision to invest, together
with corporate taxes in source and host countries. Bilateral tax treaties, in contrast, are
shown to exert no impact on FDI, supporting the view that such treaties are created not
only to facilitate investment, but also to restrict tax evasion and transfer pricing (the latter
reduce FDI incentives).
Closely related to our paper is the body of work of Razin and Sadka (2007b), who
separate the decision to invest from the quantity of FDI flows. Their pioneering empirical

3

work also consistently documents evidence for selection bias in FDI regressions.5 We
expand their approach to include the large number of regressors that have been suggested
by alternative FDI theories. Methodologically, our approach is related to Chakrabarti’s
(2001) extreme bound analysis and to Blonigen and Piger (2011) who use Bayesian
methods to analyze model uncertainty surrounding FDI stocks in a cross section. In
contrast, we examine the dynamics of FDI flows from 1988-2000 and control for
selection bias.
2.

Empirical Methodology

Bergstrand and Egger (2007) provide theoretical foundations that motivate the use of
gravity equations to analyze FDI patterns. The gravity equation has become the most
popular approach in examining FDI determinants (see Barba Vanaretti and Venables,
2004), suggesting that FDI flows can be modeled according to

Yijt   0   t  1 log GDPit   2 log GDPjt   3 log Dij   4 X ijt   ijt ,

(1)

where the log of bilateral FDI at time t, Yijt, depends positively on the market size of host,
j, and source, i, countries, GDPjt, and GDPit, as well as on their bilateral distance, Dij.
Typically a matrix of covariates, Xijt, is included to represent alternative FDI theories.
These regressors are motivated at length in Section 4 below. The inclusion of time fixed
effects,  t , is standard to eliminate bias resulting from aggregate global shocks. Time
fixed effects also mitigate possible spurious correlation that could be introduced, for
example, by the use of the U.S. CPI to deflate FDI flows.
The canonical selection bias framework is given by the system of equations6
Z   'W  
Y   ' X   (if Z > 0)

(1)

where Y is the dependent variable, X is a set of covariates, and Z is an unobserved factor
that dictates whether Y is observed. Z is determined by a set of variables W, where X and
W may share several variables. The error term of (1) is jointly distributed

FDI selection bias is also prominent in Davies and Kristjansdottir (2010), and Balsvik and Haller (2011).
Whenever possible, we suppress subscripts to simplify notation.

The classical selection bias arises when  2  0 , which causes the OLS estimates of 
that use only the observed values of Y to be biased.
Heckman (1979) proposes a method to correct this bias. His Heckit model first
performs a probit regression on Z, which is equal to 1 if Y is observed and 0 otherwise,
~
using W as covariates and yielding vector estimates,  . Once  is found, Z  ˆ' W is
~
~
formed to obtain the Inverse Mills Ratio, ˆ   Z  Z , which is the ratio of the

 

~
probability density function over the cumulative distribution function of Z . In a second
stage, those Y that are observed are regressed on X and the Inverse Mills Ratio,  ,
yielding the consistent vector estimates, ˆ . The Inverse Mills Ratio (sometimes called
“selection hazard”) is a function that is motivated by the properties of truncated normal
distributions to control for selection bias. When the null hypothesis that the coefficient on
the Inverse Mills Ratio is zero is rejected, selection bias is present and OLS estimates are
downward biased.
HeckitBMA combines Heckit and BMA methodologies. Just like the Heckit
methodology, HeckitBMA processes the data as a two stage estimator, but it also
addresses model uncertainty in both stages. The first stage is an application of BMA for
logistic regression based on Viallefont, Raftery and Richardson (2001) to form model
averaged estimates of Z and  . Below we introduce the two HeckitBMA stages in detail.
As we introduce HeckitBMA notation, it is helpful to review BMA properties that
are implied in stage 1. Let Z    i 1 iWi   , where W1 ,W2 ,...,W p is a subset of
p

W1 ,W2 ,...,Wn .7 The set of potential models is comprised of the individual models

M1 ,..., M S .

BMA stipulates that the posterior distribution of  given the data, D, is

given by the weighted average of the predictive distribution under each model. The
specific weights are derived from the models’ corresponding posterior probabilities,

where pr  n | M s , D  is the predictive distribution given model M s , and  s  pr M s | D 
is the model’s prior probability. The posterior model probability for each first stage
model is

(4)

pr D | M s    pr D |  s , M s  pr  s | M s d s

(5)

is the integrated likelihood of model Ms with parameters  s . The prior densities for
parameters and models are pr  s | M s  and pr M s  , respectively.8
Posterior model probabilities are also the weights used to establish the posterior
means and variances

The posterior distribution for a parameter is a mixture of a regular posterior
distribution and a point mass at zero, which represents the probability that the parameter
equals zero. The sum of the posterior probabilities of the models that contain a variable
yields its inclusion probability, which is taken as a measure of the importance of that
variable. For instance, for variable Wk we may write,

where Mk is a collection of indices for which s  M k implies model Ms does not restrict

We follow the literature with the standard assumption of uniform model priors (so that, ex ante, each
model is presumed equally likely). Our parameter prior is the Unit Information Prior (see Raftery, 1995).
This prior has been criticized as too conservative (e.g., returning too few effective regressors), but Eicher,
Papageorgiou and Raftery (2011) show that in economic applications the prior density is sufficiently spread
out to be reasonably flat over the region of the parameter space where the likelihood is substantial.
Fernandez, Ley and Steel (2001) propose an alternative prior, which is also popular in economic
applications, it is however, significantly more conservative and can have lower predictive performance.

6

Kass and Raftery (1995) stipulates effect-thresholds for posterior probability. Posterior
probabilities < 50% are seen as evidence against an effect, and the evidence for an effect
is either weak, positive, strong, or decisive for posterior probabilities ranging from 5075%, 75-95%, 95-99%, and > 99%, respectively. In our analysis, we refer to a regressor
as “effective,” if its posterior inclusion probability exceeds 50%.
2.1.

Selection Bias and HeckitBMA

While BMA has previously been applied in the context of international
economics,9 our specific FDI application requires an extension of the canonical BMA
theory to account for selection bias. When the structure of the data suggests the potential
of selection bias, the BMA framework can be extended to a two-step Heckit model
averaging procedure in which estimation is performed. HeckitBMA documents whether
the absence of observed FDI flows is the result of randomly missing observations or due
to endogenous FDI selection decisions that introduce bias to OLS coefficient estimates in
previous FDI studies.
HeckitBMA is a nested BMA approach that establishes the posterior model
probabilities in the first stage according to the BMA methodology, determining both  s
~
and Z s , as well as the first stage fitted values for each model Ms. The methodology then

forms the model averaged fitted value according to

and derives from this the Inverse Mills Ratio, ˆBMA   Z BMA  Z BMA . 10
Denoting by L  L1 ,..., LN  the set of second stage models, HeckitBMA uses

ˆBMA and the data, D, to derive the second stage posterior model probabilities,

See e.g., Eicher, Henn, and Papageorgiou (2008) and Blonigen and Piger (2011). Other BMA applications
in economics include investigations of growth determinants such as Fernandez, Ley and Steel (2001) and
Eicher, Papageorgiou and Raftery (2011), Iterative BMA in Eicher, Papageorgiou and Roehn (2007) and
2SLSBMA in Eicher, Lenkoski, and Raftery (2009).
10
An alternative Bayesian approach to sample selection models involves the imputation of the censored
observations (see e.g. Chapter 14 of Koop et al.). On paper, such an approach is appealing, since the
posterior distribution can be approximated through the seemingly straightforward application of a Gibbs
sampler. However, in practice the requirement that such a large number of missing values be imputed at
each step of the sampler may lead to considerable autocorrelation in the Markov Chain (see Omori 2007),
thereby causing convergence to be extremely slow, if not practically impossible.

Equation (10) shows that the HeckitBMA estimate is formed as the average of each

estimate that results from using the combination of  and model Ln in the second

calculate the inclusion probabilities as

The HeckitBMA inclusion probability carries the same interpretation as in the
conventional BMA methodology. The only difference is that the inclusion probability is

FDI Theories and Model Uncertainty

This section outlines the model uncertainty surrounding FDI determinants, which
requires a brief survey of existing FDI theories. Early FDI theory suggested two distinct
motivations for FDI: horizontal FDI, which is undertaken to access markets when firms
encounter trade restrictions, and vertical FDI, which leverages low factor prices in host
countries to reduce production costs (see, e.g., Markusen, 1984 and Helpman, 1984).
Markusen et al. (1996) and Markusen (1997) unified these two FDI motivations in the
knowledge-capital model of FDI. Due to its complexity, closed-form solutions of the
knowledge-capital model are elusive and simulated results highlight nonlinearities.
New trade theory provides for additional and more intricate FDI patterns.
Ekholm, Forslid and Markusen (2007) and Bergstrand and Egger (2007) suggest export
platform FDI is undertaken to serve not only the host country, but also to produce goods

Note this implies that the inverse Mills ratio, ˆBMA , is not subject to model selection, hence we cannot use
its inclusion probability as an indicator for the existence of selection bias. Instead the Mills ratio’s Bayesian
Credible Interval is used.

that are subsequently exported to neighboring countries. This strand of the literature
highlights the importance of a comprehensive account of regional trade agreements in the
empirical approach. Vertical interaction FDI is undertaken when subsidiaries in host
countries ship intermediate goods back and forth for processing before exporting finished
products back to the parent (see, e.g., Baltagi, Egger and Pfaffermayr, 2007).
These theories have been taken to the data with mixed success in a variety of
econometric approaches. Carr, Markusen and Maskus (2001) provide evidence in favor
of horizontal and vertical FDI that is consistent with the knowledge-capital model.
Blonigen, Davies and Head (2003) showed, however, that the evidence is not robust once
the econometric model correctly accounts for the fact that the data of Carr, Markusen and
Maskus covers only U.S.-bilateral FDI. Bergstrand and Egger (2007) introduce a third
mobile factor (physical capital) to the knowledge-capital model to highlight the
interaction between trade agreements and FDI flows. They find substantial evidence for
effects of RTAs on FDI flows, which vanish, however, when transport and investment
costs are included.
Yeaple (2003) utilizes affiliate sales to their parent companies to interact factor
endowment differences with industry factor intensities. He reports positive evidence for
both vertical and horizontal FDI motivations. Coughlin and Segev (2000) focus on export
platform FDI by exploring possible regional/spatial FDI patterns to find evidence for
export platform FDI and agglomeration externalities. Further support for export platform
FDI is provided by Blonigen, Davies, Waddell, and Naughton (2007), who estimate
negative FDI effects associated with neighboring-country FDI, using US/EU data.
Finally, Baltagi, Egger, and Pfaffermayr (2007) develop a general model of FDI
in a multi-country world. It predicts how neighboring country characteristics (e.g., GDP,
trade costs, endowments, etc.) affect FDI in a given host country, depending on the
specific FDI motivation (horizontal, vertical, export-platform, etc.). They find mixed
evidence and only weak support for export-platform and vertical interaction FDI.
4.

Existing Empirical Approaches and Candidate Regressors

The above set of FDI theories and their associated empirical approaches motivate a
substantial set of candidate regressors that identify FDI determinants. In this section we
9

outline the set of regressors that have been associated with each of the above mentioned
theories as well as the regressors that are commonly added to FDI gravity equations as
additional controls (see Table 1 for a summary).
Aside from the typical gravity variables specified in (1), generic regressors such
as Language, Border, and Colonial History are usually added to capture country-pair
specific effects that might induce/obstruct FDI. In addition, the Real Exchange Rate is
included in the gravity model as depreciations in the host country are thought to increase
both the intensive and extensive margins of FDI (Goldberg and Klein, 1998).
Depreciations reduce the amount of foreign currency needed to purchase assets abroad,
and reduce the nominal return to the source in terms of foreign currency. Hence the often
insignificant real exchange rate coefficient should not be surprising in large panel FDI
studies.
Factor endowments are another key determinant of FDI. GDP Per Capita is
commonly included to proxy for FDI that leverages differences in incomes, development,
or capital abundance. As a measure of country income level, per capita GDP is expected
to increase FDI flows for both source and host countries. As a measure of capital
abundance, per capita GDP is predicted to generate positive FDI outflows for source
countries and negative flows for host countries, since basic FDI models imply flows from
capital-abundant to labor-abundant countries (Egger and Pfaffermayr, 2004). Education
differences among country pairs are a proxy for vertical FDI motivations. According to
the knowledge-capital model, greater educational disparities are expected to promote
larger vertical FDI outflows.
Prospective growth, proxied by GDP Growth, signals higher returns, which attract
FDI to a host and reduce outflows from a source country (see Rodrick, 1999 and Lim,
2001). Ekholm, Forslid and Markusen, (2007), Blonigen et al. (2007), and Baltagi, Egger
and Pfaffermayr (2007) also include Market Potential (the size of proximate third country
markets) to indicate each country’s attraction as an export platform. Great market

potential signals that the country should receive more export platform FDI as the host can
serve relatively large markets in its relative proximity. However, the coefficient of this
regressor has seldom been reported to be of the right sign, given large and important

10

outliers such as Japan. A third economic factor that is seen to exert crucial influence on
FDI returns is Country Productivity (see Rodrik, 1999, Razin, Rubenstein, and Sadka
2004, and Razin, Sadka, and Tong, 2008). Razin, Sadka, and Tong (2008) develop a
theory where productivity increases affect FDI setup costs such that an increase in host
productivity reduces the likelihood of new FDI, but increases FDI outflows to existing
subsidiaries.
Blonigen (2005) highlights how Corporate Tax Rates and Tax Treaties influence
FDI flows while Razin and Sadka (2007b, Ch 10) point out the differential impact of
source/host tax rates. Host taxes reduce FDI primarily at the intensive margin and source
tax rates increase FDI outflow primarily at the extensive margin. Increases in source
countries’ corporate taxes induce multinationals to establish new affiliates abroad, but the
quantity of production transferred abroad increases when host countries’ tax rates decline.
Although the number of bilateral tax treaties has increased from 100 to over 2,500 since
1960 (Egger et al., 2006), the empirical evidence regarding their effects is ambiguous
(see Davies, 2004 for a survey). Studies often do not differentiate between the intensive
and extensive margins; when the margins of FDI are considered, as in Blonigen and
Davies (2004, 2005), results show strong positive effects of existing tax treaties on FDI,
but negative effects of new tax treaties (see also Egger et al., 2006). When Di Giovanni
(2005) examines only the extensive margin of FDI, positive effects of tax treaties are
reported.12
Financial risk also serves as a central determinant of FDI. Razin, Sadka, and Tong
(2008) include crucial risk measures in their econometric analysis. Economic and
Political Risk have also featured prominently in recent growth regressions; variables that
proxy for such risks are included in regressions to capture factors that impact the return
on investment. Carr, Markusen, and Maskus (2001) first included variables that relate to
economic and political risk, such as the risk of expropriation. It is usually thought that
less risk increases inflows to a host and reduces outflows from a source country.

12

The design of tax treaties may also contribute to the ambiguous findings. While treaties reduce
withholding taxes and double taxation; Radaelli (1997) and Gravelle (1988) assert that reducing tax evasion
is the primary goal of U.S. tax treaties via reduced transfer pricing and Hines (1996) shows that the way in
which source countries eliminate double taxation can have different implications for FDI activity.

11

We also include measures of regional trade agreements and currency unions.
There is considerable evidence that currency unions affect FDI, although much of the
research has focused on Europe only (see e.g., Petroulas, 2007 and Baldwin et al., 2008).
Trade and FDI are well known to be closely related, and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott
(2009) find that roughly 50 percent of U.S. trade is intra-firm trade between affiliates of
the same MNC. Here the thorny issue is endogeneity; hence we focus on the effects of
Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), which have a clear but not necessarily direct impact
on FDI via export platform and/or horizontal/vertical FDI incentives.13 The ambiguity
arises as RTAs might increase FDI to an export platform within the RTA, and reduce it to
all other members of the RTA. In addition, RTAs alter firms’ tariff-jumping FDI
incentives to amplify export platform FDI effects (Blonigen, 2002). To separate trade
effects that arise within and between RTAs, Eicher, Henn, and Papageorgiou (2008)
highlight the importance of controlling for all possible individual RTAs rather than
including just one average catch-all RTA effect.
Given the diversity of theories, the common approach has been to focus on
specific effects, such as tax treaties, or particular RTAs. Since we are proposing to
juxtapose alternative theories, we seek to include representative regressors that
encompass as many of the previous approaches as possible. The number of previous
approaches is only superseded by the remarkable diversity of the associated results. Table
1 summarizes the diversity of positive and negative effects that have be obtained for the
same regressors in FDI studies; it highlights not only model uncertainty, but also the
fragility of the results when model uncertainty is not accounted for as part of the
statistical methodology. If different approaches focus only on particular subsets of the
FDI model space, it is no surprise that the associated results generate potentially different
conclusions for the same regressor. The purpose of HeckitBMA is to resolve this model
uncertainty, which requires this comprehensive set of regressors.

Data

13

The Asia-Pacific Economic Community (APEC), the Dollar Currency Unions (DOLLAR), the European
Economic Area (EEA), the European Free Trade Area (EFTA), the EU, the Eurozone (Euro), the Latin
American Integration Agreement (LAIA), and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have
sufficient observations to be included.

12

Our dataset is based on Razin, Sadka, and Tong (2008), which includes data on
productivity, GDP per capita, skill differences, common language, distance, population,
and host and source country financial risk.14 Their FDI outflow data was obtained from
the OECD International Direct Investment Database (OECD) and deflated by the U.S.
CPI. We augment the Razin et al. (2008) dataset to allow tests of the alternative theories
outlined above. The additional data collected includes additional controls for tax rates,
tax treaties, trade agreements, currency unions, institutions, market potential, market size,
and exchange rate agreements.
Average effective corporate tax rates are calculated using the definition and
information in Altshuler et al. (1998), Blonigen and Davies (2004), and U.S. Treasury
Corporate Tax Files. A list of bilateral tax treaties was obtained from Neumeyer and
Spess (2005). Trade Agreements (multilateral and bilateral), as well as currency union
indicators were obtained from Eicher and Henn (2011). Market potential is constructed
according to the definition provided in Blonigen et al. (2007).
For institutional variables we include country risk proxies that are obtained from
International Country Risk Guides (ICRG 1985-2000), which also provides the exact
variable definitions. Information on economic risk covers the host and source country’s
Corruption, Bureaucratic Efficiency, and Investment Profile.15 Political risk is proxied by
Democratic Accountability, Ethnic Tension, Internal/External Conflict, Government
Stability, Political Violence, Rule of Law, Military Government Participation, Religious
Tensions, and a Socio-Economic profile (which includes unemployment, consumer
confidence, and poverty measures).16 Our unbalanced panel finally covers years 19882000 and includes 46 countries (21 non-OECD), 803 unique country pairs with 14863
total observations, of which 64 percent indicate zero FDI flows.

There are small

differences between the 55 regressors in our study compared to the 56 regressors in
Blonigen and Piger’s (2011) cross section that relate to missing time dimensions of some

Financial risk is an index of five components: foreign debt as a percentage of GDP, foreign debt service
as a percentage of exports of goods and services, current account as a percentage of exports of goods and
services, net international liquidity as months of import cover, and exchange rate stability.

FDI Determinants and Model Uncertainty

Table 3 reports both Heckit and Heckit BMA results to highlight the impact of model
uncertainty on the number and types of reported FDI determinants at the intensive
(extensive) FDI margins.17 The Table is ranked by the regressors’ inclusion probabilities
at the intensive FDI margin for Heckit and HeckitBMA. The Table highlights the
importance of model uncertainty in the analysis of FDI determinants: Heckit suggests 35
(27) FDI determinants at the intensive (extensive) margins, which is dramatically higher
than the 24 (14) regressors suggested by HeckitBMA.
The substantially greater number of regressors suggested by Heckit indicates the
importance of model uncertainty in FDI regressions. Heckit simply reports statistical
significance for the full model, but does not account for the existence of alternative
models and theories. Table 3 reports that alternative models, which are much more
parsimonious, receive far greater support from the data. This is confirmed by the
difference between the joint likelihoods in Heckit and the best models in HeckitBMA.
The likelihood-ratio test, which does not penalize for the included number of regressors,
easily rejects the Heckit model in favor of the best HeckitBMA model, the model that
received the greatest weight in the model averaging procedure. Similarly, the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), which is used to compare the performance of nested model
specifications, clearly favors HeckitBMA. Hence it is no surprise that Heckit
overestimates significance levels to generate an excessively large number of FDI
determinants. HeckitBMA provides not only fewer, but also different FDI determinants.
It supports two additional FDI determinants (one each at the intensive and extensive
margins) that were not significant in the Heckit methodology. This highlights again that
Heckit inference was not based on models that received the strongest support from the
data. HeckitBMA reveals not only more parsimonious models, but models that also
suggest different regressors, regressors that where shown to have no effect in Heckit.

17

As in Razin, Rubenstein, and Sadka (2004) we include a negative FDI lag, to account for negative FDI
flows (e.g., the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary).

6.1.

Robust FDI Determinants

In this section we detail robust FDI determinants. We first examine regressors that are
associated with the decision to invest. This FDI margin is crucially important given the
structure of the data where large segments of observations are either zero because FDI is
not profitable, or because the data is systematically missing. Both Heckit and
HeckitBMA show that the gravity approach is appropriate and that the Heckman
selection methodology is necessary.

All gravity regressors exhibit high inclusion

probabilities and correct magnitudes at both margins of FDI. In addition, we find that the
Inverse Mills Ratio indicates decisive (or highly significant) evidence of selection bias in
the HeckitBMA (or Heckit) procedure as reported in Table 3. The exclusion restriction
(Past_FDI_Dummy) suggested by Razin et al. (2008) is shown to exert a decisive effect
on the decision to invest.18 It is thus clear that a full account of firms’ decisions to invest
in a selection (or participation) stage is critical to eliminating the omitted variables bias
that contaminates parameter estimates in pure OLS approaches.19
To simplify the discussion of the effects in Table 3, we group effective FDI
determinants into two categories, “economic” and “country characteristics,” and consider
extensive and intensive FDI determinants in sequence. For the extensive FDI margin,
HeckitBMA suggests that country characteristics such as a common colonial background,
lacking a common border, the absence of religious tensions (in the host), socio economic
tension and corruption (in the source) increase the likelihood of FDI flows. Economic
factors that exert a positive effect on the extensive margin of FDI include a host’s market
size, market potential, and level of development, while higher taxes and productivity
negatively impact a source country’s decision to invest. Notably, neither trade nor tax
agreements, nor educational differences influence the decision to undertake FDI.
At the intensive margin, HeckitBMA indentifies a significantly greater number of
FDI determinants. Robust FDI determinants at the intensive margin pertain not only
18

Razin et al. (2008) propose that FDI setup costs imply a profitability threshold so that past FDI relations
can serve as an exclusion restriction.
19
Goldberger (1972) and Greene (1981) show that in the presence of selection bias, the OLS estimator is
biased downward and the degree of the bias is related to the proportion of data censored. Since 64% of the
data in the OECD FDI dataset is potentially censored the bias may be substantial. This may be one reason
why Blonigen and Piger’s (2011) approach does not produce a substantial number of robust FDI
determinants.

15

specifically to the host and source, but also to bilateral characteristics such as common
history/language, as well as share membership in an RTA (APEC) or a currency union
(Dollar). Country characteristics that increase FDI include the lack of corruption and
internal/religious tensions in the host and the absence of corruption, better bureaucratic
efficiency and democratic accountability in source countries. Economic characteristics
that increase bilateral FDI flows include larger market size and lower taxes (in both
source and host), and a higher levels of development, productivity, and growth in the host
country. Interestingly large market potential reduces FDI flows to a host and higher levels
of development reduce FDI flows from source countries, ceteris paribus. As expected a
source’s investment profile and bureaucratic efficiency increase FDI flows.
The results are also insightful in terms of the absence of effects that are
commonly reported in the literature. No RTA other than APEC influences FDI in either
the selection or flow equation, and tax treaties are never found to be effective FDI
determinants. In addition, skill differences are also shown to exert no effect on FDI.
These results confirm the findings of the previous literature that RTA export platform
effects may be weak and that tax treaties may not only facilitate, but also impede FDI
when treaties are also designed to reduce tax evasion and transfer pricing. Blonigen and
Piger (2011) also do not find that skill differences drive knowledge-capital FDI motives.
7.

Conclusion

FDI flows increased dramatically in the past 20 years. Over the same time period,
the literature produced a dramatic proliferation of FDI theories as well as empirical FDI
approaches. The uncertainty surrounding FDI theories and empirical approaches has
created the notion that few FDI determinants are truly robust. Numerous empirical
studies estimate only subsets of particular FDI theories to produce results that are often
either inconclusive or outright contradictory. Statisticians refer to such diversity of
theories and results as model uncertainty. When model uncertainty is not addressed
comprehensively as part of the empirical strategy, traditional robustness analyses
overstate significance levels and confidence intervals.
We extend the FDI literature in two dimensions. First, we construct a large dataset
that represents a comprehensive set of FDI determinants that have been proposed by

16

previous theories. Second, since large shares of FDI data are systematically missing from
even the most detailed FDI dataset, we introduce HeckitBMA, which extends Bayesian
Model Averaging to resolve the model uncertainty and in the presence of selection bias.
Our approach allows us to separate and estimate the determinants of two separate aspects
of the FDI decision: a) the decision to invest abroad and b) how much to invest in a
particular host country.
Our results show that the impact of model uncertainty on FDI estimates is
substantial and that the Heckman selection methodology is necessary. Without
controlling for model uncertainty, the conventional Heckit procedure suggests nearly
twice as many FDI determinants as HeckitBMA at the extensive margin and 12
additional regressors (33%) at the intensive margin. This is not surprising, since Heckit
does not consider the models associated with alternative theories. Instead we find that
HeckitBMA assigns the greatest weight to more parsimonious models that score
dramatically better in terms of joint likelihoods or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).
The determinants of the intensive and extensive margins of FDI are also shown to differ
profoundly.
We find only mixed support for horizontal or export platform FDI theories
(Markusen, 1984). Trade agreements and currency unions do not encourage FDI across
the board, but only in specific instances (e.g., dollarization and APEC membership). Host
country market potential is shown to exert a decisive effect on FDI flows, but the effect
runs counter to the predictions of export platform FDI theory. As in Blonigen et al.
(2007), we find that a host’s proximity to large markets results in less FDI – as large,
proximate markets divert FDI from a potential small host, perhaps to take advantage of
scale economies. Vertical FDI theory (Helpman, 1984) is not strongly supported since
FDI is sensitive to higher levels of development and, contrary to the knowledge-capital
model, we find no evidence that educational differences exert robust effects on either the
intensive or extensive margins.
