Abstract
Using the statistical technique Model-based Clustering (Fraley and Raftery, 2006)
we identify five typical age patterns of mortality in 844 life tables from the Human
Mortality Database (University of California, Berkeley and Max Planck Institute for
Demographic Research, 2009). Time rather than geography is the most important
dimension along which the Human Mortality Database life tables are clustered. Using
each pattern as the basis for a ‘family’ in a traditional system of model life tables, we
create a one-parameter model to generate ‘levels’ of mortality within each family. The
result is a new effectively two-parameter system of model life tables for the countries
and time periods included in the Human Mortality Database. We demonstrate the
use of this model life table system to extrapolate full age patterns of mortality from
age-restricted mortality indicators such as 5 q0 or 45 q15 . We conduct an out-of-sample
validation using life tables from both the Human Mortality Database and the WHO
life table database (World Health Organization, 2010). A friendly R package that
implements the model life table system calibrated to the Human Mortality Database
life tables is available by request.

Introduction
Motivation

Absent high quality vital registration systems that could accurately describe the age pattern
of mortality, many countries must rely on indirect estimation by using systems of model
life tables. Model life table systems represent typical age patterns of mortality that can be
used for many purposes including to extrapolate complete age patterns from age-restricted
indicators of mortality such as child (5 q0 ) or adult (45 q15 ) mortality.
Existing model life table systems were generated using data from restricted geographical
locations and time periods, with the newest model systems dating back some 30-50 years. In
some instances, these systems are unable to reflect contemporary mortality experiences including extremely low childhood mortality observed in some contemporary developed world
settings (Coale and Guo, 1989; Wilmoth et al., 2009) or elevated adult mortality resulting
from unusual causes such as HIV.
Building on earlier work (Clark, 2002; Clark et al., 2009), we aim to identify commonly
observed age-patterns of mortality in the Human Mortality Database (University of California, Berkeley and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, 2009) and build an
easy-to-use model life table system based on the observed mortality patterns. We identify
typical age patterns by using a model-based clustering method. Using each pattern as the
basis for a ‘family’ in a traditional system of model life tables, we create a one-parameter
model to generate ‘levels’ of mortality within each family. The result is a new, effectively
two-parameter system of model life tables for the countries and time periods included in the
Human Mortality Database.
We begin with a brief review of the use and structure of existing model life table systems,
followed by a description of the Human Mortality Database. We then present a detailed description of the model, fitting method and resulting ‘families’. Finally, we discuss usage and
validation of the system with an out-of-sample collection of empirical tables. We also include
a discussion of future directions for this line of research including extending the method to
empirical tables from the INDEPTH network of demographic surveillance sites, which include tables from Africa and high HIV prevalence settings.

1.2

Existing Model Life Table Systems

All model life table systems, including the one presented in this paper, are generated from
analysis of a large collection of historical mortality profiles. Unlike mathematical models
such as Gompertz (1825) or the all-age model advanced by Heligman and Pollard (1980)
that depict the shape of human mortality with relatively few parameters, empirical models
like the Coale and Demeny (1966) model life tables, UN Model Life Tables for Developing
Countries (1982), model by Wilmoth and colleagues (2009) and relational models like Brass
(1971) and Murray et al. (2003) and the system described in this paper contain a larger
1

number of ‘true’ parameters but are able to reflect the detailed variation in human mortality
with a very small number of ‘effective’ parameters. This is because most of the parameters
become fixed leaving just one or two that vary to capture the variation in human mortality,
often a measure of child mortality.
Because model life table systems are generated from a collection of empirical tables, they
can only reflect the extent of mortality variation contained in the empirical data used to generate the system. For instance, the widely used Coale and Demeny and UN model life tables
for developing countries cannot generate schedules for which child mortality is extremely low
because that kind of mortality profile did not exist at the time those systems were created
(Coale and Guo, 1989; Wilmoth et al., 2009). Figure 1 plots the relationship between adult
and child mortality for the HMD collection (each black circle represents one table) and the
patterns produced by these two systems. These figures show that those mortality profiles
with extremely low child mortality are not well represented by any of the patterns in these
two widely used systems. This issue is poised to become increasingly important as child mortality continues to fall throughout the world. Additionally, although not well represented in
the data used to generate our system, no system to date has included adequate data from
Africa or data that could reflect the mortality profile characteristic of high HIV prevalence
settings. Thus, there is little reason to believe any system can accurately represent these
profiles generated under a very different set of demographic and epidemiological conditions.
It is clear that creating a model life table system based on contemporary data that can
reflect the current range of modern mortality experiences is an important improvement over
current widely-used systems, but the work presented here has other advantages as well. Typically, the user must supply specific mortality measures like 5 q0 as input parameters. Our
system allows the user greater flexibility in terms of the input parameters in that virtually
any measure of mortality (1 q0 , 5 q0 , 45 q15 , e0 , etc.) can be employed to select into the appropriate ‘family’ and subsequently the single-parameter model for selecting the appropriate
‘level’ ensures coverage of a wide range of mortality schedules.

Data

We identify similar age patterns of mortality within a collection of 844 (for each sex) period life tables from the Human Mortality Database. This collection is a publicly available dataset maintained by the University of California, Berkley and Max Planc Institute
(www.mortality.org). This dataset has many advantages for generating a model life table
system including the high quality of the data itself along with the standardized age and time
interval formats.
The HMD contains mortality profiles from 37 mostly developed world regions with the
earliest tables dating back to the mid 18th century and the most recent from 2007. All of
these life tables have been computed from directly-observed deaths and population counts
without adjustment except at older ages (Wilmoth et al., 2007) and each table covers a

5-year period. The life tables in this collection contain approximately 84 million male and
female deaths and roughly 5 billion male and 5.5 billion female person years of observation.
An important advantage of this dataset is that each table has an open age interval at 110+.
This open interval means the system is able to produce complete sets of mortality rates with
the same open interval, which exceeds that of other widely used systems.1 We identify similar age patterns of mortality in the log mortality rate schedules (n mx ), which are presented
in figure 2.

Mortality Rate (n mx ) Schedules in the Human Mortality Database (log scale)

Method

We begin this section with a discussion of the mortality model that we use to calculate a
complete mortality rate schedule. We then describe the components of the model in two
broad steps that correspond to the two parameters of the system - identifying ‘families’ with
cluster analysis and defining ‘levels’ within ‘family’ with a one-paramter model.

3.1
3.1.1

Mortality Model
Motivation

The motivation for this model is two-fold. The model must represent mortality age patterns
in a parsimonious way that helps identify regularities among possibly many empirical age

In the widely used current systems the open age interval is typically 80+ or 85+.

patterns, and it must be able to represent a range of model mortality patterns based on the
common patterns that emerge from the empirical data.
The general form of the model will be to represent a mortality age pattern as the weighted
sum of two or more independent, age-varying components that represent the age-varying nature of the mortality schedule. To this we add a constant at each age to take into account
the non-age-varying level of the mortality schedule. Any remaining differences between the
modeled and observed age patterns are captured with a residual term.
The independent, age-varying components necessary for this model can be easily derived
from a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix of observed mortality schedules.
The resulting left-singular vectors2 are the independent components we need, and they have
the convenient property of encoding the bulk of the variance among the observed mortality
schedules in a small number of components.
3.1.2

Model

Assuming 24 age groups (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14,... 110+), a 24 x m matrix M composed of m
column vectors of age-specific mortality rate schedules can be expressed as a weighted sum
of a number of components whose shapes encode the fundamental age pattern of human
mortality and a wide range of variations on that:
M = SB + C + R

(1)

S is a 24 x n matrix whose columns are the n ‘components’ used in the model (derived from
a SVD decomposition of all of the empirical mortality rate schedules). B is a n x m matrix
whose columns are coefficients that multiply each component schedule contained in S to yield
the age-varying component of each mortality schedule. C is a 24 x m matrix whose columns
are constants that are added to the result of the multiplication to modify each mortality
schedule in an age-constant way. Finally, R is a 24 x m matrix of residuals that account for
the remaining difference between the modeled and empirical mortality schedules.

The component vectors s(·,·) can be thought of as a new basis in age-space with the special
property that most of the variance in the data is represented by a small subset of the these.
The weights b(·) determine a given point in this space, and then c adds a constant amount
to the sum of the weighted components.
The effective parameters in this model are the b’s, and as mentioned above, when only
a small number of score vectors is necessary to account for the bulk of the variance in the
empirical data set, then the number of b’s necessary is small, making the model effectively
parsimonious. Of course in reality the model is much less parsimonious because the component vectors S are parameters themselves, albeit fixed. Provided the original data set from
which they are calculated is highly varied, they will be capable of representing a wide range
of age variation and can be thought of as permanently fixed.

3.2

Identifying Similar Age Patterns of Mortality

We use a model-based clustering method to identify similar age patterns of mortality. Before
the cluster analysis, we first reduce the dimensionality of the data using Singular Value
6

Decomposition of the empirical schedules of mortality. In order to maintain congruence
of periods and locations between male and female schedules, we bind the male and female
schedules and perform the SVD on the resulting 48 × 844 matrix. SVD decomposes a matrix
into three smaller matrixes including one whose columns are orthogonal and point in the
directions with most variation in the original space – the left singular vectors. These vectors
concentrate the information in the original matrix into a smaller number of dimensions, and
as a result the information in the original matrix can be represented by just the first few
vectors. Thus, the dimensionality of the data can be reduced from 24 (or 48) age groups to
just four or five component vectors. Figure 3 plots the first five component vectors from the
SVD.

First five component vectors (left singular vectors) from the SVD of the HMD
mortality rate schedules

This reduction in dimensionality is completed by regressing (simple OLS linear regression) each empirical mortality schedule on the first ten component vectors and storing the
resulting coefficients and constants in a new data set. Keeping ten coefficients provides an
opportunity to vary the number of components used in the clustering and choose the number
that provides the best clustering.
With this new reduced-dimension data set, we use the model-based clustering method
described by Fraley and Raftery (2006) to identify robust clusters. This technique is a fully
automated, robust clustering method that identifies the number and shape of clusters that
maximizes the bayesian information criteria (BIC). Model-based clustering puts cluster analysis on solid statistical footing and answers questions concerning not only the number and
shape of clusters, but is also able to quantify uncertainty about the results. This method
7

yields both the BIC values for different numbers of clusters and the classification of the data
using the number of clusters with the greatest BIC value.
A priori there is no objective way to choose how many of our new ‘reduced’ dimensions to
include in the clustering, so clustering is performed on the reduced dimension data set using
2-10 dimensions, and the clustering classification from each is saved in a new data set. The
best clustering is chosen by calculating a new fit metric, the “total deviation from median”
(TDM). This is the sum of the absolute differences between each mortality schedule and the
median of all mortality schedules in the cluster to which it is assigned. Lower values of the
TDM indicate less variation among mortality schedules in each cluster, and consequently,
the best clustering has the lowest overall TDM value.

3.3

Model Life Tables

Following the structure of existing systems, the one presented here is composed of ‘families’
with different ‘levels’ of mortality in each. Each ‘family’ is based on one of the clusters
identified using the procedure described above. The structure of the system is presented in
equation 5.
(underlying family-specific age pattern) + α ∗ (family-age-specific deviation)

(5)

where α varies to generate levels within a family.
3.3.1

Life Table Families

The underlying-family-specific age pattern of mortality for each family is identified by first
obtaining the median set of coefficients for each family (cluster) and inserting them into
equation 1 to obtain a ‘family’ pattern. The resulting cluster-specific median mortality rate
schedules are the underlying mortality age profiles on which the model life table families are
based Mf , where f indexes the families.
3.3.2

Age-Varying Mortality Levels within a Family

There is variation in the overall level of mortality within each of the clusters that underly
the model life table families. We include this variation in equation 5 with the family-agespecific deviation. This quantity is a weighted average of variation from two sources. The
first captures age-specific variation within the family as the difference between the 97.5th
quantile for age group i and family f and the median value for age group i and family f
when α is positive, and the difference between the 2.5th quantile for age group i and family
f and the median value for age group i and family f when α is negative. The second source
is the same as the first but represents age-specific variation within the entire HMD dataset.
The calculation is the same except all of the HMD life tables are included. As α approaches
an absolute value of 1 and the resulting age pattern moves farther from the family-specific
underlying age pattern, more weight is given to the differences calculated from the the entire
dataset. When α is 1 the balance is about half-half, and when α moves beyond 1 the ‘alltables’ age-specific deviation progressively dominates. Consequently, as the family-specific
8

level approaches the ‘edge’ of the data for each family, the cluster invariant (whole data set)
age-specific deviation takes over. This produces smooth family-age-specific deviations for
mortality levels approaching, at and beyond the levels represented by the data within each
family, and as a result we are able to extrapolate reasonably to very low and high mortality
levels within all of the families.
The age-specific deviations are represented by our model in the following way. Within a
group of life tables (either a family or the whole HMD data set), the age-specific change D
below or above the median is represented by:
below the median :
above the median :

Df− = Mf [median] − Mf [2.5th quantile]
Df+ = Mf [97.5th quantile] − Mf [median]

(6)
(7)

The final expression for a life table in family f at level α is:
when α < 0 :
when α = 0 :
when α > 0 :


Mf (α) = Mf + α · e−0.75·|α| · Df− + (1 − e−0.75·|α| ) · Dh−
Mf (α) = Mf

Mf (α) = Mf + α · e−0.75·|α| · Df+ + (1 − e−0.75·|α| ) · Dh+

(8)
(9)
(10)

where f indexes families and h is the whole HMD dataset. The minus sign in (f or h)−
indicates age-specific deviations below the median, and the plus sign indicates age-specific
deviations above the median. The value of -0.75 for the coefficient in the exponential weight
is chosen so that when |α| = 1.0 there is approximately equal weight given to the familyspecific and all-HMD age-specific deviations.
Similar to previous systems, we index the levels within each family on the expectation of
life at birth. We use the optimize() function in the R statistical package (R Development
Core Team, 2006) to find values of α such that the expectation of life at birth ranges from
30 to 90 within each family.
Users of the system can supply any of a variety of measures of child or adult mortality
and discriminant analysis can be used to identify the family in which the supplied measure
is most likely to fit.3 Then the user can select a level or desired life expectancy within the
identified family.

We identify five distinct mortality patterns for males and females. The underlying family
patterns are presented in figure 4. The left panel of that figure shows that nearly all of the

discriminant analysis where any portion of the age range or any summary measure like e0 can be used as
the training data.

male patterns contain the expected young-adult mortality hump. Patterns 2 and 3 show
similar levels of child mortality while diverging somewhat in adult mortality. The rest of the
patterns show wide variation in both adult and child mortality for both males and females.

Figure 5 plots the relationship between adult mortality (45 q15 ) and child mortality (5 q0 )
in the observed data (small circles) as well as the resulting relationships from each model
family after varying α. This figure reveals that by varying α this system can cover a wide
range of human mortality experiences. For example, patterns 2 and 4 cover cases of low child
mortality at both high and low adult mortality respectively, while patterns 1 and 5 result
from very high adult and child mortality regimes.

4.2

Components of each Cluster/Family

Each cluster or family contains life tables from a wide range of geographic locations. In
contrast, the life tables in each cluster tend to come from similar historical periods. For
instance patterns 2 and 3 do not contain any life tables with start dates before 1945, while
cluster 4 contains no life tables with start dates prior to 1970. Cluster 1 contains life tables in
a middle range with start dates between 1890 and 1960, and cluster 5 contains life tables with
the earliest start dates (1770, 1774). Appendix A contains lists of cluster/family membership
for all the HMD life tables sorted by time and location within time, and Appendix B contains
the same lists sorted by location and time within location.

Evaluating System Performance

We assess the performance of the system in several ways, starting with how well it can
classify an arbitrary mortality indicator into one of the families. Because users typically
approach model life table systems with at least some information on the age pattern of
mortality (e.g. 1 m0 , 5 q0 , 45 q15 ), we test the use of discriminant analysis to classify partial
mortality schedules. Using the known classification from the cluster analysis as a training
data set, we attempt to reclassify each schedule from the HMD using one of four child
mortality indicators alone and combining them with 45 q15 as a second mortality measure
to determine the appropriate family. We compare the known classification from the cluster
analysis of the complete schedules with the classification of the mortality indicators resulting
from discriminant analysis. The percentage of HMD schedules that were misclassified are
presented in table 1. For all four child mortality measures alone, roughly 25-29 percent of
schedules were misclassified, while the addition of 45 q15 reduces misclassification by roughly
10-13 percentage points across all measures. When an observation is misclassified, it is
typically misclassified into an adjacent cluster because when clusters are close or overlapping
11

classification uncertainty is greatest.

We then assess how well the model reproduces known mortality schedules. First we
compare the accuracy of estimation for the system described in this paper with a recent
method advanced by Wilmoth et al. (2009). Wilmoth and colleagues report that their
system performs similarly to the WHO system (Murray et al., 2003) and outperforms the
widely used Coale and Demeny (1966) and United Nations (1982). Following the procedure
described by Wilmoth et al. (2009) we use both Wilmoth’s and our systems to predict the
WHO model life table database and compare the standard errors of the resulting residuals for
three mortality indicators, e0 , 1 m0 and 45 q15 . Results are presented in table 2. The system by
Wilmoth et al. (2009) allows the user to either use a single measure of child mortality (5 q0 )
or child mortality combined with a measure of adult mortality (45 q15 ) as input parameters.
We present both. Typically, our system (referred to as ‘Clark’ in the tables below), uses e0
to determine the level, which is presented in the table, but for comparison we have also used
45 q15 . To select the appropriate ‘family’ we use discriminant analysis with the first two age
groups (0-1, 1-4) as the training set.

Second, we conduct a more thorough validation by including life tables from the WHO
life table database (World Health Organization, 2010). We combine the HMD and WHO
life tables into a single data set and then conduct an out-of-sample validation using the
combined data set. We take a random 50% sample from the combined dataset and fit this
sample using both models (Wilmoth’s and ours) and then predict the remaining half of the
life tables using the model ‘fits’ - i.e. both Wilmoth’s and our models calibrated to the
50% random sample. To select the appropriate family in our system we use discriminant

analysis with the first two age groups (0-1, 1-4) as the training set and then select the level
by finding the value of α necessary to produce a life table whose life expectancy matches
as closely as possible the observed life expectancy in the out-of-sample life table. We then
calculate the standard deviations of the residuals for three mortality indicators e0 , 1 m0 and
45 q15 , displayed in Table 4.

Discussion

We present a parsimonious, robust model of age-specific mortality and a method for identifying common age patterns of mortality. Together these allow us to create a traditional
system of model life tables that includes a small number of families with varying levels of
mortality within each family. We ‘calibrate’ this model using the life tables in the HMD
life table database to produce a model life table system that describes the variation in agepatterns of mortality in the HMD life tables. We present various measures of goodness of fit
and conduct an out-of-sample validation using life tables in both the HMD and WHO life
table databases. Our new model life table system performs very well compared to the recent
model proposed by Wilmoth et al. (2009) which itself outperforms the other commonly used
existing model life table systems. Our new families include some with low child mortality
and relatively high adult mortality that do not appear in any existing model life table systems - i.e. families 2 and 3.

Missing from our calibrated model is mortality experience in the developing world or
in populations with unusual demographic or epidemiological circumstances, e.g. war-time
mortality or high HIV prevalence. We are addressing this limitation through a collaboration with the INDEPTH network (INDEPTH Network, 2011) of health and demographic
surveillance system sites in Africa and Asia. INDEPTH has compiled a large collection of
life tables from its member sites, and we are applying our model life table framework to the
INDEPTH collection both with and without the HMD and WHO life tables. Many of the
INDEPTH life tables describe mortality experience in populations with unusual demographic
and epidemiological experiences – including very high HIV prevalence.
Our model life table system maintains the attractive features of the traditional model
life table systems – i.e. parsimony, intuitive interpretation and ease of use – while introducing a new fully automated and statistically valid method of construction. This removes
any ‘analyst bias’ from the process of identifying the empirical regularities in a collection
of life tables and produces reproducible classifications of life tables to families. Our model
of age-specific mortality allows easy, flexible manipulation of mortality age-patterns which
enables us to construct a simple model of mortality age-patterns within each family. As
demonstrated by the out-of-sample validation, the overall modeling framework works well
with different collections of model life tables which will allow us to rapidly incorporate the
variation in age-patterns of mortality described by the INDEPTH life tables.
Finally, we have created a package with a user-friendly graphical interface that implements the HMD-calibrated version of our model for the R statistical package (R Development
Core Team, 2006). The package will be available from the CRAN archive soon and can be
requested from the authors immediately.
