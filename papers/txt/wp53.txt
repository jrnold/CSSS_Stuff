Education and Hypergamy, and the “Success Gap”
Abstract

“Hypergamy” is the tendency for women to marry up with respect to education or
other characteristics associated with economic well-being. Hypergamy tends to
disadvantage women at the top of the education distribution. The magnitude of this
disadvantage is the “success gap”. The increase in the concentration of women relative
to men at the top of the education distribution over the last several decades will tend to
increase competition for educated men and widen the success gap. However, shifts in
preferences, social norms, or parameters defining the gains to specialization and
exchange will counter this concentration effect. The question of whether, on net, the
success gap has increased or decreased over the period is therefore an empirical question.
I develop measures of the success gap, and hypergamy, and track them for women
age 40-44 with U.S. Census data.

The success gap declined substantially between 1980

and 2000. Hypergamy also declined. However, the pattern was not uniform across the
education distribution. I also find “sheepskin effects” of education on marriage

I. Intro duction
Marriage has changed substantially over the last several decades. One of the most
notable change s is the overall decline. For instance, between 1970 and 2002, the
median age at first marriage increased by nearly four years for both men and women, and
the the likelihood that an individual age 40-44 never marries more than doubled. Divorce
rates increased as well. As a result, the percentage of adults in the population married fell
substantially, from 71.7 in 1970 to 55.3 perent in 2002. 1 The decline in marriage has
been accompanied by a surge in women’s human capital accumulation and labor force
participation rates, both in absolute terms, and relative to those of men.
Such major social change has raised concerns among various segments of the
public. One fear is that women’s marriage prospects will be hampered by their
professional achievements. Economist Sylvia Hewlett expressed this view in a New
York Times interview: "Nowadays…the rule of thumb seems to be that the more
successful the woman, the less likely it is she will find a husband or bear a child." (Dowd,
2002) The premise behind the Times article is that there is a need for women to “marry
up” – i.e., there is a tendency for “hypergamy”. As the number of successful women
increases, the competition for successful husbands intensifies. In other words, the
marriage market penalizes women for their achievements, and that penalty is growing
over time.
I refer to the marriage market penalty associated with professional success as the
“success gap.” The gap is measured as the difference in the likelihood that a woman

with exactly twelve years of education marries (or is married) minus the likelihood that a
woman with more than sixteen years of education marries. For instance, my analysis will
show that, in 1980, 83.2 percent of women age 40-44 with exactly 12 years of education
were married, while 73.1 percent of women the same age with over 16 years of education
were married. This implies in a success gap of 83.2 – 73.1 = 9.9 years.
However, economic theory is unclear that the changes in recent decades would, in
fact, lead to an increase in the success gap. Moreover, for the population I study, there is
little evidence as to whether hypergamy ever was, or continues to be, the norm.

In this

paper I develop approaches to testing these hypotheses, and carry out the tests using data
from the US Census of Population.
Section II of the paper outlines the theory of marriage which is the backdrop for
the analys is. Section III describes the variables used in the analysis and reviews trends in
key variables over the analysis period, 1980-2000. I use data on individuals age 40-44,
which is, for women, essentially the end of the childbearing years and also after most
people have completed their education. I focus on the characteristic “education”, as it is
less likely to be endogenous with respect to marriage outcomes than, say, income or
wages. Section IV describes the methods. I (1) track education-marriage profiles; (2)
estimate the success gap, and test for change s over time; (3) perform parallel analyses for
men, and for the outcome “Mother”; (4) measure hypergamy, and track hypergamy over
time. Section V reports the results. I find that the success gap, measured in terms of
whether a woman is currently married, whether she was ever married, and whether she is
a mother, declined significantly in each decade. There are marked sheepskin effects in
terms of current marriage for women. Hypergamy declined overall. However, the

4

results vary over the education distribution. Declines in marriage were stronger among
the less educated, and hypergamy increased at the lower end of the education distribution.
Section VI concludes.

II. Theory
Becker’s work (1973, 1974, 1981, 1985) provides much of the foundation for the
economic theory of marriage. An individual chooses a spouse by comparing the value of
being married to him or her relative to the value of other options – marriage to other
individuals, or staying single. Marriage markets are in equilibrium.
There are several respects in which the econo mic theories of marriage explain
why the prevalence of marriage has fallen.

Becker’s (1973) specialization and

exchange model provides one. Gains from marriage arise because men have a
comparative advantage in market work and women have a comparative advantage in
home production.

Household well-being is maximized when spouses take on their

traditional roles: each specializing in the area in which he or she has the comparative
advantage. This explains why married men are more apt to be employed than married
women.
But the last several decades have seen a narrowing in the comparative advantage,
as women’s labor market productivity has increased relative to men’s. As Goldin (1990)
and Smith and Ward (1989) point out, this is clearest when we consider selection
corrected estimates of women’s labor market earnings. 2 Oppenheimer’s (1997) review
2

Blau and Kahn (2004) track these trends into the more recent period and note that there

has been slowing convergence in women’s and men’s earnings, largely attributable to the

5

cites a number of social scientists who attribute the decline in marriage to the decline in
comparative advantage and reduced scope for gains from specialization and exchange.
Grossbard-Shechtman (1993) develops a general equilibrium model of the
markets for male and female market labor and spousal labor. One focus of her work is
the marriage squeeze – marriage market conditions adverse to women born on the
upswing of the baby boom – in explaining the decline in marriage. In terms of this
model, the marriage squeeze reduced the price of women’s spousal labor. This combined
with the increase in women’s relative wages to reduce equilibrium marriage rates and
increase the supply of women’s labor to the formal market.
Other forces can be introduced into the framework. Akerlof et al (1996), Akerlof
(1998) and Goldin and Katz (2002) focus on the role of improved birth control
technology which weakened the link between sex and marria ge and provided women
greater control over their human capital accumulation paths. Debate (Murray 1984,
Moffitt 1992) exists about the size of the incentives posesd by the welfare system.
Wilson (1987) emphasizes the role of the deteriorating labor market for less-skilled men,
particularly within the black community. Changes in family policy such as the
liberalization of divorce laws, as well as shifts in preferences and social norms, also
shape the returns to marriage.
The questio n of “who marries whom” is addressed in the literature on marriage
market matching, or assortative mating. “Positive assortative mating” is the degree of
similarity of spouses with respect to an outcome and “negative asortive mating” is the
degree of dissimilarity. Becker (1973) shows that positive assortative mating is the
decreased narrowing of the unexplained portion of the wage gap.

6

equilibrium outcome of a matching model when spouses are complements in the
household production process, and negative assortative mating is the outcome when gains
from marriage arise from specialization and exchange. Lam (1988) adds that, to the
extent the motivation for marriage is the consumption of household public goods, there
will be more positive assortative mating. Grossbard-Shechtman’s (1993) theory
incorporates other characterizations of matching, such as the tendency to marry within
(homogomy), or outside (heterogamy) one’s group.
Mare (1991) and Pencavel (1998) find that there has been an increase in positive
assortative mating with respect to education; i.e., spouses’ education has become
increasingly similar. These papers address the problem symmetrically – not considering
whether women are more or less likely to “marry up” (or “marry down”).
This is a particular concern when we note that the distribution of education across
the population has shifted considerably in the last several decades. Women have become
substantially more educated relative to men. For instance, in 1960, 39 percent of
bachelors degrees were awarded to women, but by 2000 the number swelled to 57
percent. The number of doctorates awarded to women grew fourfold over the same forty
year period – from 11 percent in 1960 to 45 percent in 2000. Similar increases are
reported across the entire educational spectrum. 3
What are the implications for the marriage market when the distribution of
women’s, relative to men’s education, shifts? To answer this question it is necessary to
consider the issue of the asymmetry in marriage matching patterns, i.e., hypergamy.

“Hypergamy” is the tendency for women to marry up with respect to some favorable
characteristic, such as education, income, or social status. Hypergamy, in one form or
another, is an empirical regularity over time and across cultures.
Work outside of economics which explains hypergamy as the result of
fundamental social norms and preferences. For instance, anthropologist Barbara Miller
(1981) studied areas of rural north India and found that strong social pressures for
hypergamy implied a lack of suitable husbands for high caste girls. This created a
disequilibrium that was resolved through female infanticide.
The Talmud, a set of Jewis h writings originating in the second century on which
Jewish law and practice are based, also comments on the practice. Yevamot, 63a
contains advice for men to “go down a step to take a wife," another states that “a woman
from a more distinguished family than her husband may consider herself superior and act
haughtily toward him” (Rashi). 4
The notion that preferences are the fundamental source of this emp irical regularity
remains. For instance, in a 2002 New York Times column, Maureen Dowd stated: “Men
veer away from ‘challenging’ women because they have an atavistic desire to be the
superior force in a relationship.”
In contrast to the preference/norms explanations, hypergamy can be the outcome
of a model of specialization and exchange. Specialization and exchange of the
“traditional form” – in which the husband specializes in market work, the wife

specializes in home production and they combine resources and benefit from gains to
trade – is the result of men’s comparative advantage in the labor market.
Given an initial degree of hypergamy in a market – determined by social norms,
by preferences, or by comparative advantage - women at the top of the education
distribution, will tend to be disadvantaged (i.e., less likely to marry). The “success gap”
is the likelihood that a with twelve years of education (typically the median level of
education) will marry minus the likelihood that a woman at the highest education level
will marry.
All other things being equal, the increased concentration of women at the top of
the education distribution which we have seen over the last several decades would be
expected to increase the success gap, as it creates greater competition for educated men.
However, hypergamy is endogenous, and will itself change in response to the shift in the
education distribution, as well as to other external forces. Considering all these factors,
theory alone cannot tell us whether the success gap has been increasing or decreasing.
Rather than estimate a full structural model in this paper, I test for changes in the
success gap and hypergamy over time. Theory allows us to conjecture about how we
would expect changes in comparative advantage, preferences and norms to affect each of
the endogenous variables. 5

These relationships are outlined in Table 1.

The exogenous forces in this theoretical framework are the parameters driving
matching patterns. The most relevant for the question of changes in hypergamy and
success gaps are the parameters shaping comparative advantage and the seemingly
5

As Pollak (2000) points out, formal matching models typically do not account for non-

marriage.

ubiquitous preferences/social norms for women to (at least weakly) marry up. Education
is a strong correlate of market human capital, and is used here to proxy career success,
which is one factor underlying comparative advantage. 6
First (row 1), for a given tendency for hypergamy, the greater concentration of
women relative to men at the top of the education distribution increases competition for
more educated men. This will exacerbate the marriage market disadvantage faced by
educated women - i.e., it will increase the success gap directly. It will also create some
subsequent pressure for hypergamy to decline.

In the traditional specialization and exchange model, men have the comparative
advantage in market work and women have the comparative advantage in home
production. Gains from marriage will be greater for couples who are hypergamous with
respect to labor market productivity, or characteristics associated with productivity.

6

Education also increases home productivity (Grossbard-Shechtman, 1983, hypothesis

17; Jepson, 2005). The presumption is that the effect on labor market productivity
exceeds the effect on the value within the home. There are some issues with causality
that are discussed in Section VI.

10

Factors such as a decline in discrimination, an increase in women’s labor market human
capital, or an increase in the demand for women’s jobs increase women’s earnings
relative to men’s. This reduces men’s comparative advantage in market work, and the
scope for traditional specialization and exchange type marriage

and impacts marriage

market matching patterns. Whether due to shifts in the education distribution, or other
exogenous parameter changes, the narrowing of the comparative advantage will reduce
hypergamy and narrow the success gap (row 2).
Anecdotal evidence and literature from the social sciences in general, such as the
examples in the introduction, focus on the roles of preferences and norms as the
fundamental factor underlying the stylized fact of hypergamy. However social change
characterized much of the period in which the women studied made their marriage (and
divorce) decisions. Long run adjustments in preferences and social norms may have
paved the way for more egaligarian attitudes for marriage. Whether they are exogenous,
or in response to the shifting education distribution, we would expect these shifts in
preferences and norms to reduce hypergamy and the success gap (row 3). 8
On net, we would expect hypergamy to decline over the period, but the direction
of the change in the success gap is indeterminate. On one hand, as Dowd and Hewlett
7

Empirical analyses indicating that specialization and exchange has declinded include

Lundberg and Rose (1999) and Gray (1997). Blau (1998) reports that women in 1988
spend significantly less, and men spend somewhat more, time on housework than in
1978.

Goldstein and Kenney report that women with college education are more relatively

more likely to be married in 1980 than in 1960.

imply, the concentration effect will tend to widen the success gap. On the other hand,
changes in social norms and preferences, and comparative advantage, may mitigate or
even reverse the concentration effect – and lead to a decline in the success gap over time.
While the focus of this paper is on the upper end of the education distribution, it is
important to note that an similar effects might operate at the lower end of the distribution.
Less educated men, as well as highly educated women, are crowded out by the
“concentration effect”. If the model described above holds uniformly throughout the
education distribution, this would generate a decline in the proportion of less-educated
men who are married.
We would also expect shifts in social norms and preferences to generate changes
in the likelihood that less educated men would marry that mirror the effects on educated
women.
Most salient, however, would be the change in comparative advantage. The
decline in high school graduation rates since the 1970’s, and the deteriorating market for
less-skilled male labor, combine to reduce the returns to market work for less-educated
men. As Oppenheimer (1997), Oppenheimer et al (1997) and Ellwood and Jencks (2005)
note, when men’s ability to contribute by “bring home the bacon” recedes, marriages
motivated by specialization and exchange of may fail, or not arise in the first place.
As with the effects on women at the upper end of the distribution, the net result of
these changes on marriage propensities cannot be predicted by theory alone. These
questions must also be answered with empirical analysis.

III. Data
The data are from the United States Census of Population Public Use Microdata
Sample (PUMS) (5% sample ) for 1980, 1990 and 2000. Unless otherwise specified,
analyses pertain to individuals age 40-44. Table 2 reports characteristics of the sample in
each year for men and women.

Education
The coding of education on the Census changed between 1980 and 1990. In 1980,
each respondent reported the number of years of school attended and whether the final
year was completed. The questions in 1990 and 2000 focused more on degrees attained.
For 1980, some of the lower levels of education were grouped together because of small
cell counts. The correspondence between the education measures is outlined in
Appendix Table A.I-1.
The means by year in Table 2 indicate that women’s education increased more
than men’s over the period. On average, women age 40-44 had 12.50 years of education
in 1980, which increased to 13.35 in 2000. The education distributions plotted in Figure
1 indicate that the increase was driven by an increase in post-secondary education at
several levels.
The education of men age 40-44 increased from 1980 to 1990, and declined in the
subsequent decade. The distributions plotted in Figure 2 indicate that the spike is
attributable to increased college attendance by men who would have been draft age in the
peak years of the Vietnam War draft. This is consistent with Card and Lemieux’s (2001)
findings indicating that draft avoidance in the 1960’s led to a surge in college education.

13

Interestingly, there was a small increase in college attendance by women of the
comparable cohort which receded for the subsequent cohort. The data are also consistent
with Card and Lemieux’s finding’s (2000) regarding increasing high school dropout rates
of males over the period.
Figure 3 plots the differences in the education distributions for men and women.
For all levels of education above high school graduation, the difference between the
percentage of women in the category and the percentage of men in the category increased
over the twenty year period. For virtually every level from high school completion and
below, the differences between the percentages declined. Clearly, there was a shift in the
distribution of education across the population, with relatively more women with greater
than high school education, and relatively more men with high school education or less.

Marriage
For most of the analyses, the outcome is “marriage”. Two measures of marital
status are used: whether the individual is currently married (“Currently Married,” or
“Current” for short), and whether the individual has ever been married (“Ever Married,”
or “Ever”). “Current” is a dummy variable which equals one if the individual is currently
married – whether living with spouse or separated. “Ever” equals one if “Current” equals
one or if the individual is a widow or is divorced.
While there has clearly been a decline in marriage, the vast majority of both men
and women have been married at some time in their lives by age 40-44. Even in 2000, 89
percent of all women, and 85 percent of all men had been married at some point. Due to
the possibility of divorce (and to a minor extent, widowhood), fewer individuals report

14

being currently married than having ever been married. The percentage of women
currently married fell from 81 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in 2000; the comparable
numbers for men are 85 and 72 percent, respectively.

Motherhood
One ancillary analysis tracks the outcome, motherhood, with respect to education.
Unfortunately, only an imperfect measure of motherhood can be constructed consistently
over the entire period. “Mother” is based on individuals residing within the household.
Mothers of children residing elsewhere may be misclassified. This is further complicated
by the fact that in some years it is not possible to distinguish step-children from
biologic al children. In order to maintain comparability across years, “Mother” includes
both biological and step-children. Appendix Table A.I-2 details the method used to
develop “Mother”.
The statistics in Table 2 indicate that motherhood, as well as marriage, declined
over the period. In 1980, 80 percent of women age 40-44 had a child co-residing, but the
percentage fell to 70 percent by 2000. As women in this age group may have had
children in their teens or early twenties that are no longer co-resident, I compute the
proportions for women age 30-34 and 35-39. For each age category, the proportion of
women who were mothers fell by about 10 percentage points over the twenty- year period.

IV.

Methods
The relationship between educatio n and marriage is examined in two ways. First,

graphically, I track education-marriage profiles in Figures 4-7 for the years 1980, 1990

15

and 2000 using the measures of education described above. The plots use the most
precise data available, although (as described in Section III) I cannot construct exactly
comparable education series across years.
Second, I report associated statis tics in Tables 3-6. The percentages of women
married, by level of education, for each year are in columns (1), (2) and (4) of each table.
The education measures are aggregated into the following categories:

E

For each year, the difference in these percentage for education category E minus the
percentage for category E-1 is “Diff”. The decade to decade changes in Diff are reported
in columns (3) and (5), respectively.
The success gap for each year is reported in the bottom of the respective column.
It is measured as the percentage with exactly 12 years of education who are married,
minus the percentage with more than 16 years of education who are married. The
changes in the success gap by decade are reported in columns (3) and (5).

Significance tests are derived from probit models using pooled data. (Greene,
1999). The model uses pooled data for 1980, 1990 and 2000 and is of the form:

DE , i, y is a dummy variable which equals one if individual “i” in year “y” had at least “E”

years of education; where E = {Educ_LT12, Educ_12, Educ_GT12_LT16, Educ_16,
Educ_GT16}. The test of whether the difference in the likelihood of marriage for an
individual with “E” relative to “E-1” years of education in year “y” is a test of whether
the incremental effect of DE , y is significant. The p-value associated with this test
reported below Diff in columns (1), (2) and (4). The p-value associated with the test of
whether the success gap is significant is a test of whether the sum of the incremental
effects of D3, y , D4,y and D5, y is zero. This p-value is reported immediately below the
estimate of the success gap.
The test of whether Diff changed from decade to decade is undertaken by
comparing incremental effects for the two points in time. These are the p- values in
columns (3) and (5). The test of whether the success gap changed between the year “y10” and year “y” is a test of whether the sum of incremental effects of D3, y , D4,y and

17

D5, y minus the sum of the effects of D3, y −10 , D4, y−10 and D5, y −10 is zero. This p-value is

reported immediately below the estimate of the change in the success gap.
The methods for the outcome “Mother” in Figures 8-10 and Tables 7-9 are
identical.

V.

Results
The results for the outcome “Currently Married” and “Ever Married” for women

age 40-44 are described in Section V.A. The comparable results for men are in Section
V.B. and the results for the out come “Mother” are in Section V.C. Hypergamy results
are discussed in Section V.D.

V.A. Women, Education and Marriage
The relationship betweed education and the likelihood of marriage, by year, is
plotted in Figure 4.
Figure 4 indicates that the percentage currently married is (weakly) increasing
with each year of education up to twelve years, at which point there is a spike. There is a
decline for each of the following levels of education, and then another spike at sixteen
years of education, after which the slope of the profile becomes strikingly negative.
The profile shifts down at lower levels of education, in each of the two
subsequent decades.

For 1990, there are still spikes in the profile at twelve and sixteen

years of education; otherwise the profile is flatter in the latter decades. In 2000, other
than the two spikes, the profile appears to be essentially flat or increasing from high

18

school graduation forward. The three profiles actually cross between 18 and 19 years of
education.
The spikes in the “Current” profile at twelve and sixteen years of education are
reminiscent of Hungerford and Solon’s (1987) “sheepskin effects” in earnings which are
found when estimating the relationship between education and earnings. Sheepskin
effects in earnings are the significant ly greater estimated increases in earnings at the
twelfth and sixteen year of education relative to other years of education – indicating a
premium for degree completion.
Table 3 presents results corresponding Figure 4. The last row in the table is the
success gap. For a given year, it is computed as the difference between the percentage of
women with 12 years of education (E=2) who were married and the percentage with more
than 16 years of education (E=5) who were married. So, the gap for 1980 was 83.2% –
73.1.% or 9.3 percentage points, and the gap for 1990 was 77.7% – 72.7% or 5.1 9
percentage points. Column (3) indicates that the gap fell by 5.5 percentage points in the
1980’s.
The gap fell by another 5.7 percentage points in the 1990’s. By 2000, the
success gap was -0.7 – women with higher levels of education were slightly more likely
to be married.
The sheepskin effects were significant in each of the three years. Going from
exactly twelve years of education (Educ_12) to more than twelve but less than sixteen
years of education (Educ_GT12_LT16) is associated with a significantly lower likelihood

Some differences are off by a tenth of a point due to rounding error.
19

of marriage, but proceding to college completion (Educ_16) is associated with a
significantly greater likelihood of marriage (p<.001 in all cases.)
The profiles for “Ever” are plotted in Figure 5 and, the associated data are
reported in Table 4. The “Ever” profiles are similar to those for “Current”, but they are
smoother – there are no spikes at twelve and sixteen years of education. For 1980, the
likelihood of having ever been married is substantially lower at 19 years of education
relative to that at 12 years of education. The difference reflects a success gap consistent
with Dowd and Hewlett’s statements. However, this difference fell in each of the two
subsequent decades. The compression in the profiles at high levels of education indicates
that the widely noted decline in marriage, at least for women in this age group, was been
driven mainly by women at lower levels of education.
Notably, there are no sheepskin effects in the “Ever” profile. The difference
between the two profiles is that “Ever” includes divorced and widowed women, and
“Current” does not. As widowhood in this age group is rare, the difference between the
two profiles reflects divorced women and suggests that women who tend to drop out from
college are more likely to “drop out” from marriage. 10 The unobservables associated
10

Another possibility is that women who are divorced are more likely to be attending

college at the date of the interview. I examined this using the 1980, which asks whether
the individual has completed the respective year of education, or is still attending or
dropped out. The percentages currently attending women (men) in the sample were: 3.8
(2.9) percent of married, 4.7 (3.1) percent of widowed, 6.7 (3.3) percent of divorced, 4.9
(3.2) percent of separated and 6.0 (4.1) percent of never married. To the extent that
interviews were conducted over the summer, the percentage currently attending do not

20

with degree completion are associated with marriage completion as well. The fact that
degree completion, rather than educational attainment, reflects the social skills that carry
over to career success provides support for a model in which education is a signal of
ability (Spence, 1973). 11
In summary, the success gap, as measured as the difference in the likelihood of
marriage for women with 12 years of education and those with more than 16 years off
education, was significant in each of the three years. However, the gap fell significantly
in the 1980’s and the 1990’s. The “sheepskin” effects in terms of the outcome “Current”
were significant in each year, but there were no sheepskin effects in terms of the outcome
“Ever”. But what about the other side of the market?

V.B. Men, Education and Marriage
The education/marriage profiles for men are plotted in Figures 6 and 7.
For 1980, education appears to increase the likelihood a man is currently married
for levels of education below high school completion. The profile is flat beyond that
point, perhaps with some small declines between 12 and 15 years of education. The
profiles shifted down and became steeper in each of the next two decades.
The 1980 and 1990 “Ever” profiles are relatively flat from twelve years of
education. The profiles shifted downward in each of the subsequent decades, particularly
for the lower levels of education. Overall, the figures suggest that, for men, the decline in

reflect those still in school but between years in a program.
11

I thank Ted Bergstrom for this point.

21

marriage over the last several decades reflects primarily a decline at the lower end of the
education distribution. 12 13
The results in Table 5 indicate that in 1980, beyond high school completion,
marriage rates varied little by eduation – the range is 85.4 for greater than high school but
less than college to 86.0 for exactly twelve years of education. There was also a small
(0.5 percent, but borderline significant (p=.027) success gap. By 1990 a “negative
success gap” for men clearly emerged. Marriage rates for men with more than 16 years
of education were 5.8 percent higher than for those with just twelve years of education.
This increased to 12.2 percent in 2000. The 1990 and 2000 gaps, and the changes by
decade were all highly significant (p<.001).
12

Because cohabitation has become a partial substitute for marriage over the period

(Bumpass et al, 1991), I also performed the entire analysis using the outcome “Partner” –
whether an individual is currently married or cohabiting (living with an opposite sex
partner). Cohabiting is relatively rare for individuals in their early 40’s. Therefore, for
both men and women, the results for “Partner” were similar to those for “Current” (Rose,
2004).
13

Education/marriage profiles for men and women were also estimated for whites and

blacks separately and are reported in Rose (2004). The profiles for whites are similar to
those for the overall sample, which is not suprising as whites are comprise a majority of
the population. The patterns for blacks were substantially different, however. There was
no “success gap” in any year. The profiles for both black men and black women were
approximately flat in 1980, but became more upward sloping in each of the subsequent
decades.

22

In 1980, there is evidence of a quantitatively very small but statistically
significant sheepskin effect. The marriage rate declines by about a half of a percentage
point, when moving from 12 years of education to the next level (p<.001), and then
increases by nearly the same rate when proceeding to college completion (p=.079).
There are no sheepskin effect in the other years.
Marriage rates for the outcome “Ever Married” were also relatively constant over
most of the range of education in 1980. Small declines in the top two education
categories, however, combine to produce a significant success gap of 1.4 percent
(p<.001). The gap was not significant in 1990, and became negative (-3.0) in 2000. The
marriage advantage associated with education is not nearly as pronounced for the
outcome “Ever” as it is for “Current”.

V.C. The Motherhood Success Gap
Because much of the popular concern regarding the success gap focuses on the
fact that career success compromises women’s opportunities for mothe rhood, I also track
the relationship between education and motherhood in Figures 8 through 10 and Table 7
through 9.
Figure 8 suggests that, at higher levels of education, there was indeed a negative
relationship between motherhood and marriage for women age 40-44 – when
childbearing is, by and large, completed. In 1980, 81.3 percent of women with exactly
12 years of education were mothers at age 40-44, while only 72.0 percent of women with
more than a college education, yielding a “motherhood success gap” of 9.6 percentage
points. However, as with women’s marriage success gap, the difference fell in each of

23

the subsequent two decades: to 8.0 percentage points by 1990 and 2.3 percentage points
by 2000. These gaps and the subsequent declines in the gaps, were statistically
significant.
As the measure of motherhood I use is based on coresident children, to the extent
a woman’s children will have left home, motherhood will be understated. Since more
educated women have their first child later, this will tend to lead to greater
understatement for less educated women, and understate the motherhood success gap.
Rindfuss, Morgan and Offutt (1996) report that the tendency for educated women to
delay childbearing increased during the period 1963-1989. This means that there will be
a greater understatement of the gap over the period 1980-2000, or a spurious decline in
the success gap.
As a check, I look at the relationship between education and motherhood for
women age 30-34 and 35-39 in Figures 9 and 10, and Tables 8 and 9. While not as
marked, there is a success gap for each of these groups, which declines significantly in
the 1980’s (and may increase at the highest level in the 1990’s). The upshot is that,
overall, for women, education is becoming less of an impediment to parenthood as well
as to marriage. 14

V.D. Hypergamy

14

A measure of motherhood based on children ever born can be calculated from the

Census data for 1980 and 1990, but not 2000. Results using this measure reported in
Rose (2004) also indicate a decline in the motherhood success gap.

24

In this section I examine marriage matching patterns for women age 40-44 and
test for a shift in these patterns. I characterize married couples as “hypogamous” if the
husband had less education than the wife, “same” if the spouses reported the same level
of education, and “hypergamous” if the husband had more education than the wife.
Results are reported in the top panel of Table 10, and graphed in bar charts in Figure 11.
In 1980, the largest category was “hypergamous” (37.6 percent), followed by
“same education” (36.1 percent ) and “hypogamous” (26.3 percent). The difference of 12
percentage points between the proportion of couples in which the wife married up
relative to the proportion who married down, indicates hypergamy overall. However,
over the 20-year period, hypergamy fell, and hypogamy increased. The patterns for
husbands are similar.
To compare the extent of asymmetry among various age groups and cohorts, and
across the education distribution, I define “net hypergamy” as the percentage of couples
in a particular group that are hyperga mous minus the percentage that are hypogamous.
Figure 12 plots this index along the education distribution.
Overall, the likelihood a woman marries up declines as her education increases.
Net hypergamy is positive at the bottom of the education distribution and negative at the
top of the distribution. Overall, there is a decline in net hypergamy – i.e., in the tendency
for women to marry up. However, this differs across the education distribution. While
there is a decline for couples with more educated wives there is an increase in net
hypergamy at the bottom of the distribution.
The data in the bottom two panels of Table 10 are consistent with the
relationships suggested by the figures. For women with less than twelve years of

25

education, net hypergamy is significantly positive in each year, and the degree of
hypergamy increased significantly in the 1980’s and the 1990’s. However, at the top of
the education distribution, net hypergamy fell significantly in each of the two decades.

VI.

Conclusions
Marriage and education patterns have shifted dramatically in the last several

decades. At first glance one might expect that the increase in the concentration of
women at the top of the education distribution would have disadvantaged more educated
women, and less educated men, in the marriage market. In this paper, I explore this
implication by tracking education/marriage profiles, and marriage matching patterns,
from the 1980, 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census, for men and women age 40-44 in those years.
The success gap – defined as the likelihood a highly educated woman marries
relative to a woman with twelve years of education – actually declined in the 1980’s and
1990’s. This was true whether the gap was measured in terms of whether a woman was
currently married, was ever married, or has had any children. Hypergamy - the tendency
to marry up - also declined over the period, perhaps in part to accommodate the changing
education distribution, or, plausibly, due to a decline in specialization and exchange or a
shift in norms or preferences.
However, disaggregating across the education distribution reveals a more
complex pattern. The weakening economic prospects of men at the bottom of the
education distribution have rendered many below the threshold of marriagiability. While
marriage rates have plummeted for men and women with a less than high school
education, the declines for those with a college degree or more have been modest.

26

Matching patterns are also not uniform throughout the education distribution. The
decline in hypergamy has been concentrated at the top of the education distribution hypergamy has actually increased among couples in which the wife has less than a high
school degree. Less educated women have increasingly been reaching upward in the
education distribution for husbands, if not opting out of marriage entirely. The findings
in this paper accord with Oppenhe imer’s (1997) view that a model of declining returns to
specialization and exchange best describes marriage patterns for lower-income
individuals.
Several caveats regarding causality must be considered in evaluating these results.
For instance, if later cohorts of more educated women are less negatively selected in
terms of unobservables associated with marriage, the decline in the success gap could be
attributed to a change in the pattern of selection into marriage. Alternatively, it may be
that couples do not match on education, but on some characteristic associated with
education, and matching on this characteristic remains more stable over time. Also,
education may respond to marriage itself – with women in the later cohorts being more
likely to remain in school while married. Outcomes such as earnings or income may
better describe ultimate career success. However, using these measures would raise new
levels of concern regarding endogeneity, as labor market outcomes for both women and
men have been shown to respond to marriage and parenthood 15 . As the literature expands,
more rigorous econometric techniques can be applied to all these problems in order to
address these difficult issues of causality.

27

There are some important implications of these results. First, for women, higher
education no longer appears to be a hindrance to marriage, and motherhood. The
perception that women face a stark choice between career and family is becoming less
accurate in each successive decade.
Second, the decline in marriage is overwhelmingly a phenomenon of the less
educated segments of the population. Men’s education- marriage profiles have gone from
being relatively flat in 1980 to strongly steep in 2000. The worsening labor market
opportunities for less-skilled men have severely limited their ability to contribute to
marriage. In terms of policy, measures designed to encourage marriage are more likely to
be successful when targeted towards improving the economic prospects of men at the
bottom of the economic spectrum.

“Child” and associated variables do not distinguish step- vs. biological relationships

with respect to head in 1980.
b

Biological and step-children are distinguished in 1990 and 2000.

d

2000 Census data distinguish biological and adopted children; both are treated as

children in here.
c

Cannot distinguish grandchildren from step-grandchildren, and children- in-law from

step children- in- law in 1990 and 2000.
e

Biological and step-relationships are not distinguished for subfamilies in any year.

f

Biological and step-relationships are not distinguished for parents, grandparents, and

parents- in- law of head for any year.

48

If individual had different relationships with respect to different children in
household, he or she was assigned to a category pursuant to the following ranking:
Mother f Maybe f Step f Not Mother
“Mother-1” includes Mother and Maybe. “Mother-2” was used in the analysis,
and includes Mother, Maybe and Step. This measures less accurate for the last
two years, but comparable over all years.
