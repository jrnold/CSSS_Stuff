Correcting for Selection Bias in Estimates of HIV Prevalence
from Sample Surveys

A common method of measuring HIV prevalence is to include HIV biomarker collection in household sample
surveys primarily designed for a variety of other investigations. The usual procedure is:
1. Choose a sample.
2. Attempt to contact households and individuals in the sample. Some fraction of the sampled individuals
are found and agree to be interviewed.
3. Interview the consenting members of the sample and in the course of the interview attempt to collect
biomarkers. Some fraction of the interviewed individuals agree to provide biomarkers.
4. Conduct assays to provide HIV status for individuals who were i) found and agreed to interview and
ii) agreed to provide biomarkers for testing.
5. Transform the HIV status of the individuals who were tested into population-level estimates of HIV
prevalence.
There are two selection processes that separate the population from the individuals who agree to biomarker
collection. At both stages, the selected sample can be (increasingly) systematically different from the population, resulting in bias in the population-level estimate of HIV prevalence. Under specific conditions the
Heckman selection model is designed to identify the effect of selection in a single selection step. This ability can be used to identify a selection effect in the second stage of the process outlined above for a typical
survey-based HIV prevalence study – the selection to test among those who are found and interviewed.
The correction is accomplished by:
1. Using the Heckman selection model to identify and quantify the selection bias in estimated HIV prevalence.
2. Using estimated results from the Heckman selection model to predict the HIV status of the individuals
who did not agree to biomarker collection.
3. Combining the real data describing those who did agree to testing with the predicted HIV status of
those who did not agree to testing to produce an estimate for the entire group of individuals who were
found and agreed to be interviewed, not yet the whole population.

1.1

Aim: Does the Heckman Selection Model Correction Procedure Work?

The aim of this work is to test the Heckman selection model correction procedure. We want
to characterize the effectiveness of the Heckman selection model procedure to correct estimates of HIV
prevalence from sample survey data in a situation where we know the real prevalence.

1.2

Overview of the Heckman Selection Model

There are two processes at work. One mechanism leads to individuals being observed and another affects
whether or not they are HIV+. These mechanisms work at the same time and may be related. The Heckman
selection model assumes that we can model the selection process as a binary outcome with an individual
either being observed S = 1 or not S = 0. Similarly, the process leading to being HIV+ can be modeled
as a binary outcome with an individual either being HIV+ H = 1 or not H = 0. The catch is that
the outcome H is only observed when the individual is selected. The Heckman probit technique models
the binary outcomes as having normally distributed probabilities, hence both are probit models. After
3

accounting for the variation associated with known explanatory variables associated with both selection and
outcome, the Heckman probit method assumes that each process is left with normally distributed errors.
Possible correlation between selection and outcome is allowed by correlating these error terms. The Heckman
probit estimation procedure simultaneously estimates the regression coefficients associated with the covariates
explaining the selection and outcome processes and the value of correlation coefficient associated with the
relationship between the error terms.
For the Heckman probit method to work well, there must be sets of explanatory variables associated with
both selection and outcome, and optimally there should be one or more variables (the ‘selection’ variables)
that only appear in the selection relationship. These selection variables should not affect the outcome. This
yields two equations, one for selection that includes the selection variables, and one for the outcome: the
‘selection’ and ‘outcome’ equations.
There are standard procedures for estimating the biprobit Heckman selection model, and they strictly require:
1. the conditional joint error distribution be bivariate Normal, and
2. the ‘instrumental’ variables that appear in the selection equation, those that appear only in the selection
equation, are not related to the outcome.

2

Method – Simulation Investigation

The biprobit Heckman selection model requires two strong assumptions, and in general it is not possible to
test these assumptions using real data. Consequently we apply a simulation approach:
1. Define a number of simulation scenarios that fulfill the assumptions and break them in various ways.
2. Simulate datasets corresponding to each scenario.
3. Apply the Heckman selection model correction procedure to simulated datasets in each scenario.
4. For each scenario, compare the prevalence estimated using the Heckman selection model procedure
with the real prevalence that we baked into the data.
5. Finally, compare how well the procedure does across the scenarios.

3.1

Simulations
Creating Realistic Virtual Populations Infected with HIV

We are interested in testing the Heckman selection model correction procedure using data with a structure
similar to that of real populations along important dimensions over which we know HIV prevalence changes.
To keep things tractable we include sex and age and generate datasets with sex-age-specific HIV prevalence
rates that are similar to those found in high HIV prevalence populations living in Southern Africa. We
generate simulated data using a model analogous to the data generating process assumed by the Heckman
probit method. We create a virtual population with a sex-age composition similar to a real population living
in Southern Africa, and we infect the virtual people with HIV so that the sex-age profile of HIV prevalence
matches that same real population.

4

3.1.1

Data Generating Preliminaries, Age & Sex

We start by creating a variable number of virtual people and assign them ages (continuous variable) to match
the age structure of the Southern African population shown in Table 1. In an independent process we then
assign sexes with 52% female and 48% male.

Interviewer Variable

To model the interview and selection process we need a comparatively small number of interviewers to
interview our virtual subjects. We want to test well-specified Heckman selection models and also break the
assumptions underlying the model. Hence, variation in the ‘effectiveness’ of the interviewers can affect both
the selection and outcome processes, only selection for simulated populations that fulfill the assumptions of
the Heckman selection model, and both for populations that break those assumptions.
We randomly assign a variable number of interviewers to our virtual subjects. Each interviewer is assigned
an ID I and given a random ‘interview effectiveness’ Ie drawn from a normal distribution with mean µIe = 1
and standard deviation σIe = 1. Variation in this effectiveness is allowed to affect the selection and outcome
variables in flexible ways that allow us to explore the ability of the Heckman selection models to accurately
correct estimates of HIV prevalence.
3.1.3

Selection Variable

The selection variable is constructed by working a probit model backward, starting with the linear predictor
and ending up with a binary variable that indicates selection.
For individual j the value of the linear predictor of selection κ?j is
κ?j = zj γ + µsj
κ?j = ω + θ1 (agej − 40)2 + θ2 [sexj = male]

(1)

+ θ3 [Ij = 2] + ... + θ11 [Ij = 10]
+ µsj
(
where indicator variables are noted using Iverson’s bracket notation: [α] =

5

1
0

if α is true
if α is false

The probability of being selected Sj for individual j is the Normal probability associated with the value of
κ?j
Pr([Sj ]|zj ) = Φ(κ?j )
(2)
We observe the binary value (0,1) of the selection variable for individual j
(
1 if κ?j > 0
Sj =
0 if κ?j ≤ 0

(3)

The values of ω, θ1−11 , and µs are adjusted to create different selection scenarios. Our model of the selection
process includes the possibility of both a sex effect and a parabolic age effect centered at age 40. By adjusting
ω and θ1−2 we can eliminate and/or adjust these effects.
The reference group for sex is ‘female’. All of our simulations have ten interviewers, and the reference group
for interviewer is I = 1.
3.1.4

Outcome Variable

The HIV status variable is constructed in a similar fashion by working another probit model backward. In this
case the linear predictor is slightly more complicated because we want the HIV prevalence of the simulated
population to reflect something realistic with respect to the sex-age distribution of the population.
We take measured sex-age-specific prevalence of HIV from the population living in Southern Africa and add
a small amount of noise. We operationalize sex and age as indicator variables for sex and five-year age groups
from 15 to 65+. Using the real data we estimate a regular probit model predicting HIV status to generate a
set of coefficients for each sex-age category and their two-way interactions that we can use to simulate data
that encode a sex-age pattern of HIV prevalence that matches the real population. These coefficients are
inserted into Equation 4.
For individual j the value of the linear predictor κj of the outcome is
κj = xj β + µhj
κj = λ + δ1 [sexj = male] + δ2 [agej = 20 − 24] + ... + δ11 [agej = 65+]
+ δ12 [sexj = male ∧ agej = 20 − 24] + ... + δ21 [sexj = male ∧ agej = 65+]

(4)

+ δ22 [Ij = 2] + ... + δ30 [Ij = 10]
+ µhj
The probability of being HIV+ Hj for individual j is the Normal probability associated with the value of
κj
Pr([Hj ]|xj ) = Φ(κj )
(5)
Only when individual j is selected (i.e. when Sj = 1), we observe the binary value (0,1) of the outcome
(
1 if κj > 0
Hj =
0 if κj ≤ 0

(6)

For the purpose of generating data, virtual individuals are given an HIV status regardless of their selection status, but when we estimate the Heckman selection models we only acknowledge the HIV status of
individuals who are selected.
The values of λ and δ1−21 (the coefficients that generate the sex-age pattern of HIV prevalence) remain
constant across all of our simulations. We adjust the values of δ22−30 and µh to create and vary an interviewer
effect on HIV status.
The reference groups for sex and interviewer I are the same as for the selection generating process, and for
age the reference group is ‘15 − 19’.
6

3.1.5

Correlated Errors

To create the type of relationship between selection and HIV status that the Heckman selection model is
designed to identify and estimate, we correlate the error terms in the generating equations 1 and 4:
µs ∼ N (0, 1)

(7)

µh ∼ N (0, 1)

(8)

corr(µs , µh ) = ρ

(9)

Consequently the probabilities of being selected and being HIV+ can be correlated with either sign and any
magnitude – e.g. strong negative correlation implies that those who are selected are less likely to be HIV+
than those who are not, the worrying potential issue that motivates this work!

3.2

Simulation Dataset Specifications

The simulation scenarios are organized as follows:
1. Base: benchmark; all of the Heckman selection model assumptions are met.
2. Outcome scenarios: both the ‘Outcome’ scenarios break the assumption that the selection variable
does not affect the outcome.
3. Non-normal scenarios: both the ‘Non-normal’ scenarios break the assumption that conditioned on
the selection and outcome equations, the joint error distribution is bivariate Normal.
4. Sizes: this scenario varies the sample size of the virtual population.
For each of the first four simulation scenarios – Base, Outcome Strong, Outcome Weak, Non-normal
Squared, Non-normal Cubed & Sizes – we generate 500 datasets with 5,000 observations each for each
parameter set. For these scenarios we vary the Heckman ρ and the degree of selection through ω. The degree
of selection results in various fractions of the virtual populations being selected for observation – i.e. results
in situations with varying numbers of unobserved individuals for whom the Heckman selection method must
produce a predicted probability of being HIV positive. For the remaining scenario – Sizes – we generate
500 datasets with varying numbers of observations for a fixed intermediate level of selection.
To keep things manageable we vary the Heckman ρ over nine values −0.8(0.2)0.81 and the level of selection
over four values 0.5(1.0)3.5. This yields 36 combinations of ρ and ω for each the first five simulation scenarios,
which in turn requires 18,000 individual datasets for each simulation scenario; 90,000 datasets in total for
the first five simulation scenarios. For the last scenario Sizes, there are 20 combinations of ρ and sample
size with a fixed level of selection. This creates 10,000 more datasets to bring the grand total to 100,000
datasets for the complete simulation investigation.
3.2.1

Base

The Base simulation scenario corresponds to a high HIV prevalence population that fulfills the assumptions
of the Heckman selection model. There is a good selection variable, Interviewer ID, and conditional on the
selection and outcome equations, the joint error distribution is bivariate Normal. This is the ‘base’ scenario
because it represents everything working well and is used as the benchmark to which to compare all of the
variously pathologic scenarios that follow.
1 At various points in the text and Table 2 sequences of values are specified using the notation s(i)e where s is the start
value, i is the increment value used to generate consecutive values in an additive fashion (value(k+1) = valuek + i), and e is
the end value – e.g. 4(2)8 corresponds to the sequence [4, 6, 8].

7

3.2.2

Outcome Strong

In the Outcome Strong scenario, the selection variable Interviewer ID has a strong effect on the outcome
variable HIV status. This is accomplished by adding terms to Equation 4 with values for coefficients δ22−30
of 0.25 × Ie . This creates a strong relationship between Interviewer ID and the probability of being HIV
positive.
3.2.3

Outcome Weak

In the Outcome Weak scenario, the selection variable Interviewer ID has a weak effect on the outcome
variable HIV status. The δ coefficients in Equation 4 have values of 0.05 × Ie .
3.2.4

Non-normal Squared

In the Non-normal Squared scenario the conditional joint error distribution is distorted by squaring the
error terms in the selection and outcome equations, Equations 7 and 8. This results in a joint distribution
that is ‘bunched-up’ close to the origin for original error term values between -1 and 1 and greatly ‘expanded’
for original values with absolute value greater than 1. The whole distribution occupies the 1st quadrant of the
Cartesian plane and is concentrated near the origin with a long ‘tail’ toward increasing positive values.
3.2.5

Non-normal Cubed

In the Non-normal Cubed scenario the conditional joint error distribution is distorted by cubing the error
terms in the selection and outcome equations, Equations 7 and 8. This results in a joint distribution that
is greatly condensed and expanded depending on the exact values of the original error terms, and the result
occupies potentially all four quadrants of the Cartesian plane.
3.2.6

Sizes

The Sizes scenario is the same as the Base scenario with varying ‘sample sizes’, i.e. numbers of virtual
individuals. Five sample sizes are tested: 100(2,500)10,100.

Calculation and Comparison of HIV Prevalence Values
Real HIV Prevalence

Calculation of the real HIV prevalence for a virtual population is straightforward. The real HIV prevalence
Hp is
N
1 X
Hp =
[Hi = 1]
(10)
N i=1
where N is the total number of virtual individuals and Hi is the HIV status of individual i.
3.4.2

Corrected HIV Prevalence using the Heckman Selection Model

Calculation of the corrected HIV prevalence for a virtual population consists of two parts, one for selected
(observed) individuals and another for individuals who are not selected (observed). For selected individuals
the procedure is as above for the calculation of real HIV prevalence. For those who are not selected, we use
the Heckman selection model to estimate their probability of being HIV positive, and then summarize that
and combine it with the real prevalence among the selected population to arrive at the corrected prevalence
for the entire population.
For each of the simulated datasets we estimate the biprobit Heckman selection model specified in Equation
11 for selection and Equation 12 for HIV status using the heckprob procedure in the statistical package
Stata 11.2 with the options iterate(15) and difficult.
Pr([Si ]|zi ) = Φ(ηi? )
ηi? = Ω + Θ1 [sexi = male]
+ Θ2 [agei = 20 − 24] + ... + Θ11 [agei = 65+]

(11)

+ Θ12 [Ii = 2] + ... + Θ20 [Ii = 10]
+ Msi
Pr([Hi ]|xi ) = Φ(ηi )
ηi = Λ + ∆1 [sexi = male]
+ ∆2 [agei = 20 − 24] + ... + ∆11 [agei = 65+]
+ ∆12 [sexi = male ∧ agei = 20 − 24]

(12)

+ ... + ∆21 [sexi = male ∧ agei = 65+]
+ Mhi
The estimated ‘Heckman ρ’ R is
R = corr(Ms , Mh )

(13)

If an estimation attempt succeeds (converges on a high likelihood solution), we use Stata’s predict command
with the options pmarg, p10, p11 and psel to generate and calculate the predicted values shown in Table
4.

To actually calculate the corrected HIV prevalence we use the following procedure:
1. Create a new variable Hpc containing a value of 0 for each virtual individual.
2. For virtual individuals who were observed (S = 1), replace Hpc with the value in their HIV status
variable: 0 if they are negative and 1 if positive.
3. For the remaining unobserved virtual individuals, replace Hpc with the predicted probability of being
HIV positive derived from the Heckman estimation: P (H = 1|S = 0), calculated as in the bottom row
of Table 4.
4. Calculate the corrected prevalence for the population of virtual individuals as the mean value of Hpc .
The calculation of the mean is weighted correctly because the sum is over each individual in the virtual
population.

3.5

Comparison of Real and Corrected HIV Prevalence values

We evaluate the success of the correction with a metric that compares the corrected and real HIV prevalences
controlling for the overall level of HIV prevalence, or the ‘size’ of the epidemic, recognizing that an error that
is small in an absolute sense is more problematic when HIV prevalence is low. Our metric is the proportional
error Eprop
Hpc − Hp
Eprop =

Results

Figures 1 and 2 display the mean proportional errors for each simulation scenario. The mean is taken over
the 500 estimation attempts for each parameter set in each scenario. The plots display the proportional
error by values of the Heckman ρ and the percent of individuals who were not selected. For some simulated
datasets the estimation procedure for the biprobit Heckman selection model was not able to converge. The
fractions of the 500 estimation attempts for each parameter set for each scenario that did not converge
successfully are shown in Table 5.

12

4.1

Base

Panel 1 of Figure 1 displays results for the Base simulation scenario in which all of the Heckman selection
model assumptions are valid. The magnitude of the proportional error never exceeds 0.4 percent, and there
is little variation with the fraction of individuals who were not selected to test. There is some variation with
the Heckman ρ such that there is a consistent bias toward slightly underestimating the true value of HIV
prevalence when the absolute value of the Heckman ρ is small – roughly -0.5 to 0.5.
There is substantial variation in the fraction of estimation attempts that fail in the Base simulation scenario,
see Table 5. The percent estimation failures increases dramatically as the fraction of individuals not selected
increases and the Heckman ρ decreases toward -0.8. At the extreme values of these parameters, almost half
of the estimation attempts fail – 47.4 percent.

4.2

Outcome Strong

Panel 2 of Figure 1 displays results for the Outcome Strong simulation scenario. This scenario models a
strong effect of the selection variable on the outcome. The Heckman selection correction procedure performs
very badly in this scenario. The magnitude of the proportional error is never less than 5 percent and reaches
20 percent for some parameter sets. As expected, the direction of the error is always positive because this
effect is modeled with positive coefficients δ22−30 so that the selection variable has a positive effect on the
outcome – i.e. increases the probability of being HIV positive. There is a clear deterioration in the correction
procedure as the fraction of individuals not selected for testing increases, or as the percent missing goes up.
Performance is slightly better for extreme values of the Heckman ρ in all cases.
Most of the estimation attempts succeed for this simulation scenario, see Table 5. The largest fraction of
failures occur for highly negative values of the Heckman ρ and extreme values of the percent of individuals
not selected for testing.

4.3

Outcome Weak

Panel 3 of Figure 1 displays results for the Outcome Weak simulation scenario. This scenario models
a weak effect of the selection variable on the outcome. The results for this scenario are very similar to
the Outcome Strong scenario, with magnitudes that are about 1/5th of that in the Outcome Strong
scenario. This suggests a linear relationship between the value of the parameters that model this effect and
the outcome. Parameters δ22−30 in the Outcome Strong scenario are 5× the corresponding values in the
Outcome Weak scenario.
Most of the estimation attempts succeed for this simulation scenario, see Table 5. The largest fraction of
failures occur for highly negative values of the Heckman ρ and extreme values of the percent of individuals
not selected for testing.

4.4

Non-normal Squared

Panel 4 of Figure 1 displays results for the Non-normal Squared simulation scenario. This scenario models
a violation of the requirement that the conditional error distribution be bivariate Normal. The correction
procedure performs well in spite of the distorted error distribution; the magnitude of the proportional error
is never more than 0.8 of a percent. However, in this scenario all of the errors are negative and underestimate
prevalence. The errors become worse in a symmetric way as the magnitude of the Heckman ρ increases and
as the fraction of individuals not selected increases.

13

Very few estimation attempts fail in this scenario, see Table 5. The largest fractions failing are found when
few individuals are not selected for testing and this fraction never exceeds 5.5 percent.

4.5

Non-normal Cubed

Panel 5 of Figure 1 displays results for the Non-normal Cubed simulation scenario. This scenario models
a different violation of the requirement that the conditional error distribution be bivariate Normal. The
results are similar to the Non-normal Squared scenario but worse. Again the errors are consistently
negative, but in this case the magnitude reaches 7 percent in the worst case. The symmetry seen for the
Non-normal Squared scenario is not observed for this scenario. The errors are worse all around but much
worse for negative values of the Heckman ρ. In contrast, there is less variation in the magnitude of the error
as the fraction of individuals not selected for testing changes.
Almost a third of the estimation attempts fail for some parameter sets in this scenario, and there is a strong
pattern in the failure profile with Heckman ρ and fraction of individuals not selected to test, see Table 5.
The fraction of failures is low when both are moderate and increase rapidly as the Heckman ρ decreases
away from 0 and the fraction individuals not selected increases and as the Heckman ρ increases from 0 and
the fraction of individuals not selected decreases.

4.6

Sizes

Figure 2 displays results for the Sizes simulation scenario. This scenario investigates what happens at the
‘sample size’ changes. This is accomplished by varying the number of virtual individuals in the simulated
datasets. The parameter values used in this scenario are the same as for the Base scenario except the
fraction of individuals not selected for testing is fixed at an intermediate value. Not surprisingly, the results
are very similar to the Base scenario for all sample sizes except the smallest, 100. When the sample was
only 100 the method essentially failed and produced large errors that are strongly related to the value of the
Heckman ρ.
The fraction of estimation attempts that fail in this scenario is also very similar to the Base scenario except
when the sample size is 100, and in that case virtually all estimation attempts fail, see Table 5.

5

Discussion

This investigation used a simulation approach to test the Heckman selection model correction procedure
designed to identify and correct for selection effects in sample surveys used to estimate HIV prevalence. The
main results are very clear:
1. When the conditions required by the Heckman selection model are met, the method works very well.
2. When the two important assumptions of the Heckman selection model are violated, even mildly, the
method does not work well.
3. A reasonable sample size of magnitude 1,000 is necessary for the procedure to function.
The results from the Base simulation scenario demonstrate how well the procedure functions when the
conditional error structure is bivariate Normal and the selection variables do not affect the outcome at all.
Results from the Outcome simulation scenarios demonstrate that the method is essentially useless if the
selection variable affects the outcome even a little bit. Likewise, the Non-normal scenarios reveal that the
shape of the conditional error distribution matters a lot.

In general it is not possible to definitely test real data to determine if either of these assumptions is valid.
The shape of the error distribution is only revealed through the estimation process, and is a sensitive function
of the variables included in the selection and outcome equations. If some of the variables affecting selection
and outcome are missing, then it will by definition be impossible to properly characterize the conditional
error distribution, and since no survey will every have all the variables affecting either, it is purely a matter
of story telling to ascertain how close to conditionally Normal the error distribution is.
Likewise, it is not possible in a general sense to be sure that selection variables are not related to the
outcome, and as the Outcome Weak scenario makes clear, even a weak association is enough to produce
systematically incorrect results with large magnitude.
Given these results, our advice is:
1. Only use the Heckman selection model correction technique when ‘good’ selection variables are available
and the sample size is relatively large, ∼1,000s.
2. Interpret the results in a limited sense:
• If the Heckman selection model converges nicely and produces stable estimates and if the estimate
of the Heckman ρ is statistically significant and of a reasonable magnitude, take this as an
indication that there may be a problem with selection in your data.
• Do not use the corrected HIV prevalence values as an indication of the true prevalence. Because
the assumptions of the Heckman selection model are essentially untestable, there are effectively no
circumstances in which you can be sure that they are met, and therefore given the de facto high
likelihood of being wrong, the relatively large magnitude of the likely error, and the consequences

17

associated with being wrong, it is not advisable to ‘correct’ estimates of HIV prevalence with this
procedure.
