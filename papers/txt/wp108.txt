Abstract
Current methods for reconstructing human population structures of the past are
deterministic or do not formally account for measurement error. We propose a method
for simultaneously estimating age-specific population counts, fertility rates, mortality
rates and net international migration flows from fragmentary data, that incorporates
measurement error. Inference is based on joint posterior probability distributions which
yield fully probabilistic interval estimates. It is designed for the kind of data commonly
collected in modern demographic surveys and censuses. Population dynamics over the
period of reconstruction are modeled by embedding formal demographic accounting relationships in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Informative priors are specified for vital
rates, migration rates, population counts at baseline, and the accuracies of their respective measurements. We investigate calibration of central posterior marginal probability
intervals by simulation and demonstrate the method by reconstructing the female population of Burkina Faso from 1960 to 2000.

INTRODUCTION

Every two years the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) publishes detailed estimates of key demographic parameters for all countries in the world; they appear in the
United Nations World Population Prospects (UNWPP; e.g., United Nations 2009). The parameters reported include age-specific fertility and mortality rates (vital rates), population
counts and international migration rates. These figures are used for the development and
assessment of policy by the United Nations (UN), national governments, researchers, journalists and many other groups. They and are of particular importance for countries that
lack their own well-resourced official statistical systems. For many of these countries, the
UNPD is a key partner in the process of compiling, analyzing and publishing the data.
The United Nations World Population Prospects (UNWPP) tables can be classified into
two broad groups, known as estimates and projections. Projections are predictions about
demographic parameters in the future, while estimates concern population structures of the
past. We will use the term reconstruction which we find less ambiguous. Nevertheless, use
of the term “estimate” agrees with standard usage in statistics; data about demographic
parameters in the past are used to estimate the true values. Between the biennial editions
of the UNWPP, new data are collected, and old data become available, thus revisions must
be made to the reconstructions to accommodate it.
Implicit in the previous paragraph is the assertion that there is uncertainty in the measurements. This is hardly controversial; demographers have long acknowledged that some
parameters are almost immune to perfect measurement and many so-called indirect methods
exist for estimating them (e.g., United Nations 1983). Most of these, however, are focused
on obtaining a best point estimate of a single quantity. Although it has been standard practice to produce ranges of estimates for many parameters based on different scenarios, high,
medium and low fertility for example, the ranges produced cannot be interpreted probabilistically. This approach is still commonly used for projections, but since the mid 1990s
new methods began to appear which do yield probabilistic predictions; Lee (1998) and Booth
(2006) provided reviews. In contrast, there has been relatively little work on the development
of fully probabilistic methods for demographic reconstruction. Here we propose a general
method for reconstruction that accounts for measurement uncertainty and works with the
type of demographic data that have commonly been collected for most countries over the
last 60 years or so. It has been designed to fit within the UNPD’s existing work-flow, but
we hope it is general enough to have broad appeal.
In Section 2 we will briefly describe existing reconstruction techniques from the demographic literature; a discussion of relevant work in other areas such as ecology and fisheries

5

will be deferred until the Discussion. In Section 3 we lay down our notation and describe
the method. In Section 4, we investigate some statistical properties of our method through
simulation before applying it to real data from Burkina Faso in Section 5. We close with
a summary of the results, a literature review and a discussion of some technical issues in
Section 6.

METHODS OF RECONSTRUCTION IN
DEMOGRAPHY

Outside of official statistical agencies, demographers have undertaken population reconstructions for at least two reasons: historical studies of populations of the past (e.g., Wrigley
and Schofield 1981) and to estimate excess mortality in crises such as famine or social upheaval (e.g., Boyle and Grada 1986, Heuveline 1998, Merli 1998, Goodkind and West 2001).
The most commonly used methods are based on the demographic balancing equations. These
are the basic accounting relationships which state that the population size at time t + δ is
equal to the size at time t plus births and immigrants, minus deaths and emigrants. These
relationships are encoded in the cohort component model of population projection (CCMPP;
Lewis 1942, Leslie 1945, 1948). Given the size and age-structure of a population at some
baseline time, its size and structure at any point in the future can be determined from the
baseline population and the fertility, mortality and international migration rates that prevail
over the period of reconstruction.
The back projection method of reconstruction (Wrigley and Schofield 1981) attempts
to apply these relationships in reverse by using an estimate of population structure at the
terminal year of the period of reconstruction. This approach is problematic since the cohort
component model of population projection (CCMPP) procedure is not formally invertible.
To produce sensible results, some additional constraints have to be imposed or somewhat
ad-hoc fixes applied.
In response to these concerns, Lee (1971, 1974) proposed the method of inverse projection.
Inverse projection enacts the reconstruction forward through time; it is named for the fact
that, instead of estimating counts of births and deaths from rates, count data are used to
infer rates.
Both of these methods have been developed since their inception. For example, McCaa
and Barbi (2004) and Rosina (2004) described extensions of inverse projection. Oeppen
(1993) proposed generalize inverse projection (GIP). This method produces estimates of demographic parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between population structures implied
by the estimates and those observed. Additional constraints, such as a smoothness criterion
6

on estimates of migration, are used to ensure parameter identifiability. However, all of the
extended methods remain purely deterministic.
A stochastic reconstruction method was proposed by Bertino and Sonnino (2003) who
modeled childbirth and death as inhomogeneous Poisson processes. The method is designed
to work with counts of births and deaths aggregated over age and so requires the analyst
to specify model age-patterns for fertility and mortality, although different schedules can
be chosen for different sub-periods. These schedules are taken as the intensity functions of
the process and realizations are simulated through time to produce sequences of empirical
estimates of population age structures. Hence, the only source of variation accounted for
is natural variation around the demographic rates; the total numbers of deaths by year are
assumed to be recorded without error. Moreover, international migration is assumed to be
negligible over the period of reconstruction.
Finally, all of the above methods were designed to work with aggregate data of the kind
sometimes found in European parish registers. The data available for many countries in
our intended application is not as detailed, even for periods stretching as little as 50 years
into the past. The aim of this article is to introduce a new method of reconstruction that
uses measurements of demographic parameters available for 40–50 years in the past from
multiple noisy data sources. Moreover, uncertainty due to measurement error is expressed
as probability distributions and intervals rather than deterministic scenario-based ranges.

METHOD

In this article we restrict our attention to the dynamics of populations of females only;
extension to two-sex populations is left for future work. The parameters of interest are the
basic demographic parameters: age- and time-specific vital rates, net international migration
flows and population counts. In the sequel we will refer to “international migration” as simply
“migration” as this is the only type we consider.
The method we propose can be viewed as a reconciliation of two different estimates of
age-specific population counts, namely the estimate based on direct enumeration or surveys
(e.g., censuses) and the estimate from applying the CCMPP to measurements of fertility,
mortality and migration. The reconciliation is through a Bayesian model which provides
probabilistic posterior distributions of all of the parameters of interest. The posterior distributions summarize uncertainty due to measurement error. Probability intervals for summary
measures such as total fertility rate (TFR) and life expectancy at birth (LEB) can also be
easily calculated.

Notation and Terminology

We will index all demographic parameters by age, denoted by a, and time, denoted by t.
Age is measured on an open-ended scale with the largest value A+ , 80 years and older, for
example. We will be interested in the value of the key parameters at five-year increments of
age and time, a = 0, 5, . . . , A+ and t = t0 , t0 + 5, . . . , T . We will use the symbol A++ to refer
to the age at time t of those who were aged A+ for the first time at time t − 5. Furthermore,
[fert]

aL

[fert]

and aU

will refer to the lower and upper ages of non-zero fertility, respectively. Finally,

we will need to refer to a special subset of time-points for which censuses or other direct
[cen]

[cen]

estimates of the population counts are available; we denote these times by tL , . . . , tU
where “L” and “U” indicate lower and upper limits.

We adopt the standard demographic definition of fertility rate, and let fa,t denote the
ratio of the number of births to women in the age range [a, a + 5) to the number of person
years lived by those women over the time period [t, t + 5) (Preston, Heuveline, and Guillot
2001).
Mortality will be expressed as the proportion of people who survive from one age group
to the next. Thus we set sa,t to be the proportion in the age range [a − 5, a) at time t who
survive to be aged [a, a + 5) at time t + 5. That is, sa,t is the proportion of people surviving
into the age range [a, a + 5) over the 5 years between t and t + 5. The number of people
aged [a, a + 5) at exact time t will be denoted by na,t .
Net migration over a period of time will be measured in proportionate terms; let ga,t be
the net number of migrants to the population aged [a, a + 5) who migrate during the time
period [t, t + 5), expressed as a proportion of na,t . Thus, the share of na,t+5 − na,t attributable
to migration is ga,t na,t .
Bold face and omission of the age index will be used to denote vectors of particular agespecific parameters for a given time. For example, f t is the vector of age-specific fertility
rates for the period [t, t + 5). When convenient, we will use θ to represent
(nt=t0 , f t0 , f t0 +5 , . . . , f T , st0 , . . . , sT , g t0 , . . . , g T ),
the vector of all age-time-specific parameters.
To avoid confusion when we refer to periods of time, we will use the term “reconstruction
period” to indicate the span of time over which the population is reconstructed.

and the sex ratio at birth (SRB) is taken to be fixed at 1.05, a standard default (Preston
et al. 2001). We use sA++ ,t to denote the proportion of those in the open-ended interval who
survive to time t + 5. Equation (1) can be written more compactly as

where Lt is called the Leslie matrix (Leslie 1945, 1948). We will abbreviate (1) as nt+5 =
M (nt , f t , st , g t ).
We use an asterisk (∗ ) to distinguish between the unknown, true values and measurements
∗
of them based on data. Specifically, let fa,t be the true fertility rate and fa,t
be a measurement
of it, and similarly for all other parameters of interest. In what follows, we will use D to
represent the set of all such measurements.
In addition to a measurement of the population size at baseline (n∗t=t0 ), measurements of
population counts at exact times in (t0 , T ] are typically available. These direct measurements
might be from censuses or demographic surveys. Therefore, if n∗t0 , n∗t+5 , f ∗t , s∗t and g ∗t are
available, we have two estimates of nt+5 , namely n∗t+5 and M (nt = M (nt−5 ), f ∗t , s∗t , g ∗t )
where M (nt0 ) is defined to be n∗t0 . We combine these two sources into a joint distribution
of all parameters in the following four-level hierarchical model, where we have made the
simplifying assumption that the elements of θ are mutually independent a priori :

In standard Bayesian terms, expressions (5)–(8) could be viewed as informative priors
for θ while (3) is the likelihood of n∗a,t | θ. Inference will be based on the joint posterior
distribution of these parameters, p(θ | D). We also explicitly impose the restriction that
all population counts be positive. Therefore, the joint prior on all parameters at time t,
p(nt0 , f t , st , g t ), is multiplied by

3.2.2.

Determining the Hyperparameters

To determine plausible values of αv and βv , v ∈ {n, f, s, g}, we view the σv2 as representing
the measurements of the respective demographic parameters. Although prior knowledge
about these accuracies is unlikely to be exact, we expect that informative estimates can be
derived from experts’ knowledge of the data sources. Methods for eliciting prior information
from experts are numerous (e.g., O’Hagan et al. 2006). Here, we use a straightforward
method based on the mean absolute error (MAE) of the transformed measurements.
Taking fertility rate as an example, note that (6) implies MAE(log fa,t | σf2 ) ≡ E(| log fa,t −
p
∗
log fa,t
| | σf2 ) = σf 2/π. The prior distribution for σf2 can be specified by choosing quantiles
for MAE(log fa,t | σf2 ). Suppose expert opinion is that MAE(log fa,t | σf2 ) is close to 0.1, but
could be as high as 0.5. This suggests setting median(σf2 ) = (0.1)2 π/2 ≈ 0.0151 and the 0.975

range of values between 0.3 and 6 and chose βf such that median(MAE(log fa,t | σf2 )) = 0.1.
The parameter αf was then chosen such that the 0.95 quantile of MAE(log fa,t | σf2 ) was
about 0.5.
Since demographers are more used to thinking about untransformed fertility rates, it
is useful to consider what specifying MAE(log fa,t | σf2 ) means on the original scale. In

original scale where MARE(fa,t | σf2 ) ≡ E(|fa,t − fa,t
for the MAE values used here. The MARE has been used previously by demographers as a

way of quantifying measurement accuracy (Keilman 1998).
The population count variance, σn2 , is also modeled on the log scale and αn , βn are found
in the same way as αf and βf . Survival is measured on the logit scale, but this should not be
too difficult to interpret. Note that E(| logit s¯a,t −logit s¯∗a,t | | σs2 ) = E(| logit sa,t −logit s∗a,t | | σs2 )
where s¯a,t = 1 − sa,t . In practice, the s¯a,t are close to zero, so that s¯a,t ≈ s¯a,t /(1 − s¯a,t ). Thus
specifying the MAE of the log-odds of survival is not that different from specifying it for the
log probability of death. For the migration parameter, which is a proportion, we specify the
MAE directly.

Summary of Model

We model the transformed vital and migration rates as unimodal distributions centered
at the relevant measurements which serve as fixed prior means. This is equivalent to the
assumption that the measurements are median-unbiased but noisy, which might require
preprocessing of the vital rate data. Techniques for estimating, and hence removing, the
bias in vital rate estimates are probably best developed separately as they will depend on
data collection methods and other data-specific factors. For example, building on work by
Hill et al. (1999) and UNICEF et al. (2007), Alkema et al. (2008) developed a technique for
removing the bias in TFR measurements.
The use of informative priors for both the mean and the variance parameters in (5)–(8)
is necessary because the model will be technically over-parameterized and hence underidentified in most practical applications.

Estimation

Samples from the joint posterior can be drawn using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampler (Metropolis et al. 1953, Hastings 1970, Geman and Geman 1984). Without
the restriction in (10), the full conditional posterior distributions for the variance hyperparameters would be the usual conjugate inverse gamma distributions. For example, the full
conditional for σf2 would be

With the restriction, the conjugate forms are not exactly correct but will probably be very
close to the true full conditionals. Therefore, to update these parameters we use the conjugate
full conditional distributions as proposal densities in Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) steps. The
posterior densities of the remaining parameters are not easy to express analytically since
each vital rate enters the likelihood through the map M . Therefore, these parameters are
updated using M-H steps with univariate normal proposal densities, with variances tuned
by the method of Raftery and Lewis (1996). We will use the term “iteration” to refer to one
complete sweep through all age-time specific parameters and variance parameters.
The R environment for statistical computing (R Development Core Team 2010), together
with the CODA package (Plummer et al. 2006, 2010) were used for all data manipulation,
model estimation and output analysis.

SIMULATION STUDY

Simulation was used to investigate whether the true vital rates, migration proportions
and population counts could be recovered from noisy data under the model. To this end, we
used a small, synthetic population for which the true values of all key parameters were known.
The estimation procedure was applied to noisy measurements of the true parameter values
and central posterior marginal probability intervals were compared to the truth. Calibration
of the intervals was assessed by replication.

1960, 1965, 1970, 1975. Moreover, aL = 5 and aU = 10. This is not intended to be a
realistic model of a human population; datasets typically encountered in human demography
have up to 18 age categories and any number of time periods. However, we believe that this
reduced population model is of sufficient size and complexity to explore the characteristics
of the statistical model while not being too computationally expensive. The TFR and LEB
were kept constant at 0.7 births per woman per year and 15.61 years, respectively, for the
duration of the reconstruction. A varying pattern of migration was chosen which consisted of
net out-migration in the first half of the reconstruction period followed by net in-migration in
the second half. The magnitude of the flows was quite volatile, varying from 13 percent to 26
percent of the receiving population. Moreover, migration in both directions was concentrated
in the two middle age groups.
The true population counts are shown in Table 2. Those for 1960 were chosen to represent
a young population. Those for the subsequent time periods were derived by applying the
CCMPP to the 1960 population using the vital rate and migration parameters in Table 1.
Therefore, the underlying true population dynamics over the reconstruction period were
completely and deterministically defined by (1).

∗[j]

3. Generate measurements na,t for a = 0, . . . , 15+ and t in t = 1965, . . . , 1975 from (3).
4. Check that (10) is satisfied by the measurements; if not return to step 1.
5. Draw a large MCMC sample from the joint posterior and find the 0.025, 0.5 and 0.975
quantiles of the marginal distribution of each parameter.
The estimated coverage is then the proportion of the J central posterior marginal intervals
containing the known, true value for each parameter.
The hyperparameters of the inverse gamma distributions were determined as described
in Section 3.2.2. The median MAEs for log fertility rate, logit survival and log population
counts were set to 0.1 with 0.975 quantiles of approximately 0.5. The same figures for
migration were set to 0.2 and approximately 1, respectively. The resulting values of αv , βv
and MAE quantiles are shown in Table 3.
We set J = 200 and applied the estimation method described in Section 3.3. Initial values
for the population counts, vital rates and migration proportions were set to the measured
values. Initial values for the variances were arbitrarily set to five as this appeared to have a
negligible effect on the final results. Approximately 9000 iterations, with a burn in of 100,
were judged sufficient for accurate inference.

Results and Discussion

Point estimates of the coverage of the marginal 0.95 posterior probability intervals are
shown in Table 4. These are all close to 0.95.
In practical applications with real data sets, where the true parameter values are unknown, interest will be in interval estimates for the demographic parameters. These should
be based on the joint posterior distribution. For illustration, we have plotted central marginal
credible intervals for a selection of parameters and transformations that might be of interest
based on the MCMC sample from a single replicate of the simulation study. For comparison,
we have also plotted the true parameter values used throughout the simulation and the noisy
measurements generated under the model.
Marginal central credible intervals can be plotted for age-specific parameters as has been
done for age-specific fertility rates in Figure 2a. Credible intervals for any function of the
age-specific parameters can be obtained immediately by transforming each vector of agespecific values in the MCMC sample and computing the sample quantiles. We show TFR
in Figure 2b. This is obtained from the age-specific rates by summing them and multiplying by the width of the sub-intervals of the reconstruction period, which is five in this
case. In a stationary population (Preston et al. 2001) subject to the survival proportions,

RECONSTRUCTION OF THE POPULATION
OF BURKINA FASO, 1960–2000

We now illustrate the method by reconstructing the population of Burkina Faso from
1960 to 2000.

5.1.
5.1.1.

Data
Population Counts

Population count measurements in exact years 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2005 by sex
were taken from United Nations (2009) which are based on a 1960–1961 demographic survey
and censuses in 1975, 1985, 1996 and 2006. The UN figures are preferred over the raw census
counts because important adjustments were made for underenumeration. This form of bias is
more common in certain age-groups and efforts to reduce it are based on post-censal surveys.
5.1.2.

Fertility

Information on fertility rates during the period 1960–2005 in Burkina Faso has been
collected through various means including questions about birth histories in censuses and
surveys such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Estimates of age-specific fertility rates for Burkina Faso based on data from recent births (in the preceding 12 months)
and retrospective birth histories were obtained from various sources. The recent births data
came from the 1960 and 1991 demographic surveys, as well as from the 1976 census postenumeration survey and the 1985, 1996 and 2006 censuses themselves. The retrospective
birth histories were taken from the 1992–93, 1998–99 and 2003 DHSs and refer to the preceding 20 years. In addition, for each of these data sources, adjusted fertility rates for the
most recent period were also estimated using women’s lifetime parity information and the
Brass-Feeney P/F ratio method (Brass 1964, Feeney 1996; see also United Nations 1983,
Ch. II, Sect. B).
Alkema et al. (2008) studied estimates of TFR for seven West African countries, including
Burkina Faso, and found noticeable disagreement among estimates from the various data
sources. This suggested the need to account for potential bias and to estimate the variability
of the estimates. Therefore, our prior median estimates of age-specific fertility were based
on Alkema et al.’s (2008) median bias-adjusted estimates of TFRs for Burkina Faso for the
five-year increments between, and inclusive of, the years 1962–1997. These were chosen as
they are the mid-points of the five-year sub-intervals [1960, 1965), [1965, 1970), . . . , [1995,
2000) which span the reconstruction period. Since the latest estimate given by Alkema et al.

19

(2008) is for 2001, this was used as the estimate for the period [2000, 2005). These were
then disaggregated into age-specific rates by applying an age-specific fertility pattern. These
patterns, which sum to one, indicate the share of fertility attributable to each age-group.
Therefore, the final age-specific fertility rates are the product of TFR and the age pattern.
The patterns were determined through a process we now describe.
Since we require average fertility rates for the sub-intervals [1960, 1965), . . . , [2000,
2005), we grouped the available estimates by the sub-interval into which they fell. Data of
this kind are often summarized by a single series of age-specific values per sub-interval using
a relational model or a smoothing technique. Relational models take a fixed age-pattern,
often derived from a combination of data collected in similar populations and theory about
the underlying social and biological processes, and adjust it to fit the observed data, usually
by way of a parsimonious parameterization on a transformed scale. The method of Coale and
Trussell (1974), updated by Xie (1990) and Xie and Pimentel (1992), is an example. However,
the validity of these methods rests, in part, on an appropriate choice of model age pattern.
Data-driven smoothing techniques avoid this problem, albeit at the cost of not modeling the
underlying mechanisms. Since we are not primarily concerned with such mechanisms, we
used loess (Cleveland 1979, Cleveland, Grosse, and Shyu 1992) to smooth the age-specific
fertility patterns within five-year sub-interval. The loess method performs a series of locally
weighted regressions and is implemented in the R function with the same name. Smoothing
within five-year sub-interval (Figure 3) yielded trends that were also sensible, a priori, when
viewed by five-year age group (Figure 4). No age-pattern data were available for the period
[1965,1970). To generate a prior for this period, we assumed that the [1960,1965) held over
this period but used Alkema et al.’s (2008) median TFR estimate for 1967. The resulting
∗
age-specific fertility rate measurements, fa,t
, are shown in Figure 6.

5.1.3.

Mortality

Abridged life tables for Burkina Faso can be computed from data on recent household
deaths in years for which data is available. However, potential biases arise due to the omission
of deaths, recall period errors, age heaping and age exaggeration by survey respondents. The
approach favored by the UN in this context has been to use a Brass two-parameter relational
logit model (Brass 1971), with the Timæus Sahelian standard mortality pattern (Timæus
1999), to estimate a complete set of abridged life tables for each five-year sub-interval of the
reconstruction period. Relational models use data to adjust a standard mortality pattern
such that it reflects the pattern in the population of interest. Brass’s method treats the
logit of the life table for the population of interest as a linear function of the logit of an
appropriately selected standard life table. The intercept and slope are estimated using

ordinary least squares (OLS).
Brass’s model was fitted to robust estimates of under-five mortality and adjusted estimates of adult mortality. Under-five mortality estimates were based on three types of data:
(i) recent household deaths from the 1960–1961 and 1991 national demographic surveys and
the 1976, 1985, 1996 and 2006 censuses; (ii) births and deaths to under-fives calculated from
maternity-history data from the 1992–1993, 1998–1999 and 2003 DHSs; and (iii) data on
children ever-born and surviving classified by age of mother (and the South model of the
Coale-Demeny Model Life Tables) from the data sources in (ii) as well as from UNICEF’s
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey—Round 3 conducted in 2006. Estimates of adult mortality were based on four sources: (i) recent household deaths data (unadjusted and adjusted for
underregistration using the growth-balance and synthetic-extinct generation methods) from
the 1960–1961 and 1991 national demographic surveys and the 1976, 1985, 1996 and 2006
censuses; (ii) parental orphanhood from the 1993 and 2003 DHSs and the 2006 census; (iii)
sibling deaths from the 1998–1999 and 2003 DHSs; and (iv) intercensal survivorship from
successive census age distributions (smoothed and not smoothed) for the periods 1976–1985,
1985–1996 and 1996–2006.
The usual approach to obtaining age-specific survival proportions from the resulting lifetables is to assume the relationships s0,t = L0,t /(5·l0,t ), sa,t = La,t /La−5,t for a = 5, . . . , 80 and
P∞
P
s85+,t = ∞
a=80 La,t which hold in the stationary equivalent population (Preston
a=85 La,t /
et al. 2001). La,t is the number of person years lived between years t and t + 5 by those
with ages in [a, a + 5) in year t and l0,t is the radix of the life table or annual number of
births in the stable equivalent population. While we need survival ratios for the CCMPP,
demographers more often deal with the mortality rates, ma,t ≡ da,t /La,t , where da,t is the
number of deaths to the age group [a, a + 5) in the life table operating during the subinterval [t, t + 5). In the stationary equivalent population, da,t = sa,t na,t − na,t so that the
sa,t can be easily re-expressed as mortality rates. The mortality rates per thousand implied
by the survival proportion measurements we obtained from the Brass procedure are plotted
in Figures 7 and 8.
The stationary equivalent device is used frequently in demography. In stationary populations the birth rate and age-specific death rates are constant over time and the population
is closed to migration. However, we emphasize that stationary population conditions are not
assumed to hold in the estimation process. The device is invoked only to derive the measurements, s∗a,t , and as a way to re-express the survival proportions in a form more familiar
to demographers.

Migration

Estimates of migration for many countries, even those with well-resourced official statistics systems, are often unavailable, unreliable or available only at the whole population level.
Nevertheless, some estimates of migrant flows for Burkina Faso by broad age-group and sex
are given by Cond´e (1980) for the period 1960–1975. In addition, whole-population estimates
for 1960–2005 are available from United Nations (2009) and United States Census Bureau
(2009) which indicate sustained net out-migration over the period 1960–2000 followed by a
brief reversal from 2000–2005. Cond´e (1980) implies that the proportion of migration due to
females is low. Therefore, we made the a priori assumptions that migration was concentrated
among those in the age range 15–50 and that there was net out-migration for the period
1960–2000 but net in-migration from 2000–2005. The mean magnitude for females was estimated at ±7 percent based on Cond´e’s (1980) figures. The final migration measurements
are shown in Figure 9.

Results

The parameters αv and βv , v ∈ {n, f, s, g}, were set to the same values as in the simulation
study (Table 3); the MAEs given there were based on expert opinions provided by UNPD
analysts for the case of Burkina Faso. Start values were also chosen in the same way as
for the simulation study. Chains of length 15,000 with a burn-in of 500 were found to be
sufficient.
Central marginal 95% credible intervals and posterior medians for the population counts
and age-specific fertility rates are shown in Figures 5 and 6 for illustration. Similar plots can
be constructed for age specific mortality rates, migration rates and population counts in the
years following t0 . In Bayesian terminology, the latter are the “prior predictive” distributions
of nt .
Central marginal credible intervals for (a) TFR, (b) total net number of migrants, (c)
probability of death before age 5 (5 q0 ) and (d) LEB are shown in Figure 11. The interval
widths for TFR over the reconstruction period are consistently equivalent to about plus or
minus half a child. There was a decline in TFR from 7.9–7.0 children to 6.8–6.0 children
per woman over the period 1980–2005. There was a strong upward trend in life expectancy
from 33.5–37.1 to 50.9–53.8 years is implied over the period 1960–2005. While the posterior
medians for the total net number of migrants suggest a change from a net loss to a net gain
between 1995 and 2000, all 0.95 credible intervals contain zero. Our interpretation of this
result is that there is not enough information on migration to clearly indicate a trend.

DISCUSSION

We have described a method for reconstructing past populations by age and sex which is
designed to work with the type of data commonly collected in modern demographic surveys
and censuses. Population dynamics are modeled by the well-known CCMPP and measurement error is accounted for in a coherent, fully probabilistic manner through a Bayesian
hierarchical model. Inference is based on the joint posterior distribution of all parameters.
Lee (1971, 1974) and Oeppen (1993) proposed deterministic methods of population reconstruction. We have assumed a deterministic model only for the population dynamics.
That is, given the true vital and migration rates, the evolution of the population is modeled deterministically. In contrast, Bertino and Sonnino (2003) give a method wherein the
population dynamics are stochastic and the vital rates function as mean parameters. We
agree with Cohen (2006) and expect that, in our applications at least, variation due to measurement error will overwhelm any additional variation arising from a stochastic population
dynamics model.
Daponte, Kadane, and Wolfson (1997) use an approach similar to ours to construct a
counterfactual history of the Iraqi Kurdish population between 1977 and 1990. They, too,
represented errors in the measurement of demographic parameters as the standard deviations
of probability distributions. However, they used a low dimensional parameterization of
mortality and fixed the age patterns of fertility.
Girosi and King (2008) use Bayesian models with covariates to forecast mortality. Our
aim was not to produce forecasts, nor model dependence on covariates. Instead, we have
shown how information only about the parameters themselves can be used to produce probabilistic distributions summarizing uncertainty due to measurement error. Where useful
covariate information is available, we suggest that this be applied in a preprocessing stage,
for example to remove the bias from the age-specific estimates which our model takes as
input and assumes are median-unbiased. Our method would then be used to ensure that
final estimates of multiple parameters are coherent in that they satisfy the basic demographic
accounting relationships.
In previous work, migration has been handled in different ways. Lee’s inverse projection method estimates it as a residual if censuses are available at intermediate years in the
reconstruction interval. Alho (1992) added it as extra error in measuring survival. Here,
migration is treated explicitly and age-time specific estimates are available as for the other
parameters.
Similar models have been used extensively in demographic studies of marine life and
complex population dynamics models have been developed by fisheries researchers (e.g.,

32

Quinn and Deriso 1999). As is the case in human demography, multiple sources of data
informing the same demographic parameters often exist. This led Raftery, Givens, and
Zeh (1992, 1995), Givens, Raftery, and Zeh (1993) and McAllister et al. (1994) to develop
Bayesian approaches to synthesizing these in a coherent manner.
A large body of work also exists on the dynamics of land animal populations. As with
fisheries research, data commonly come from mark-recapture or mark-recovery studies, but
radio-telemetry and age-at-harvest data are also common; Seber (1982) is a classic reference and more recent reviews are Pollock (1991) and Schwarz and Seber (1999). Bayesian
approaches to the analysis of this type of data were suggested at least as early as Gaskell
and George (1972) but Vounatsou and Smith (1995) were among the first to take advantage
of modern computers and MCMC methods to simultaneously estimate several parameters.
Subsequently, a large body of literature developed; Brooks, Catchpole, and Morgan (2000a),
Brooks et al. (2002) provided reviews while Barry et al. (2003), Conn et al. (2008) and
Corkrey et al. (2008) are just a few examples of more recent studies.
An issue given some consideration in this literature (and the demography literature;
see Lee 1985, 1993) is the fact that the population dynamics models are typically overparameterized. This causes problems for likelihood based inference because the likelihood
surface then contains ridges (e.g., Catchpole, Kgosi, and Morgan 2001). Nevertheless, in one
of the models they studied, Brooks et al. (2000b) show that a Bayesian approach can yield
sensible estimates.
Naturally, there are ways in which our framework can be refined. An extension to twosex populations is an obvious example. We expect this to be straightforward conceptually,
although technical issues associated with estimation may arise. With two sexes, we might
also attempt to estimate the SRB parameter.
We made the simplifying assumption of constant variance across age and time for each
demographic parameter on the log scale. Allowing uncertainty estimates to vary would
allow for the fact that more is typically known about infant and child mortality than old-age
mortality, for example. However, the benefits of this extension would have to be weighed
against the expense of having to estimate more parameters. This might be beneficial if
estimation is done simultaneously for groups of countries. If the groups are chosen to be
demographically similar, it might be realistic to set some of the variance parameters constant
across countries but allow for variation over time or age.
Alternatively, a small number of variance parameters could be chosen representing dif2
2
2
2
ferent degrees of uncertainty, for example, σSM
L < σM ED < σLGE < σXL . These would then

be assigned to the age-specific parameters following the same reasoning we have advocated
above. An advantage is that the number of parameters can be determined by the analyst as
33

opposed being dependent on the number of age groups or sub-intervals.
