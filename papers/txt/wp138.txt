Abstract
The original version of Bayesian reconstruction (Wheldon et al., 2013b), a method for estimating age-specific fertility, mortality, migration and population counts of the recent past
with uncertainty, produced estimates for female-only populations. Here we show how two-sex
populations can be similarly reconstructed and probabilistic estimates of various sex ratio
quantities obtained. We demonstrate the method by reconstructing the populations of India
from 1971 to 2001, Thailand from 1960 to 2000, and Laos from 1985 to 2005. We found
evidence that in India, sex ratio at birth (SRB) exceeded its conventional upper limit of
1.06, and, further, increased over the period of study, with posterior probability above 0.9.
In addition, almost uniquely, we found evidence that life expectancy at birth (e0 ) was lower
for females than for males in India (posterior probability for 1971–1976 0.79), although there
was strong evidence for a narrowing of the gap through to 2001. In both Thailand and Laos,
we found strong evidence for the more usual result that e0 was greater for females and, in
Thailand, that the difference increased over the period of study.

Introduction

The past, present and future dynamics of human populations at the country level are highly
relevant to the work of social scientists in many disciplines as well as planners and evaluators
of public policy. These dynamics are driven by population counts, fertility and mortality rates
(vital rates), and net international migration. Demographers at the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) are tasked with producing detailed information on these quantities,
published biennially in the World Population Prospects (WPP) (e.g., UN, 2011). Estimates
for each country are provided, for periods stretching back from the present to about 1950.
Currently, however, WPP estimates are not accompanied by any quantitative estimate of
uncertainty. Uncertainty should also be measured because the availability, coverage and
reliability of data used to derive the estimates differ greatly among countries. Developing
countries, in particular, often lack the extensive registration and census-taking systems developed countries maintain, so that estimates in these cases are subject to greater uncertainty.
Estimates are not error-free even for developed countries. While estimates of population
counts and vital rates are likely to be very accurate, uncertainty about net international
migration can be quite substantial. Beer et al. (2010) found this to be the case for Europe.
In response to the need for uncertainty quantification in estimates of the key parameters
driving human population dynamics, Wheldon et al. (2013b) proposed Bayesian population
reconstruction (Bayesian reconstruction for short), a method of simultaneously estimating
population counts, vital rates and net international migration at the country level, by age,
together with uncertainty. The original formulation was able to reconstruct female-only
populations. In this article, we describe a major extension to two-sex populations. This
allows us to estimate age- and time-specific indicators of fertility, mortality and migration
separately for females and males and, importantly, sex ratios of these quantities, all with
probabilistic measures of uncertainty. In addition, we also show how Bayesian reconstruction
can be used to derive probabilities of change over time in these quantities. To demonstrate
the method, we reconstruct the full populations of India from 1971–2001, Thailand from
1960–2000 and Laos from 1985–2005. These countries were selected because, in all cases, the
available data are fragmentary, which makes population reconstruction challenging.
Bayesian reconstruction embeds a standard demographic projection model in a hierarchical statistical model. As inputs, it takes bias-reduced initial estimates of age-specific fertility
rates, survival proportions (a measure of mortality), net international migration and censusbased population counts. Also required is expert opinion about the measurement error of
these quantities, informed by data if available. The output is a joint posterior probability
distribution on the inputs, allowing all parameters to be estimated simultaneously, together

1

with fully probabilistic posterior estimates of measurement error. Wheldon et al. (2013b)
showed that marginal credible intervals were well calibrated. They demonstrated the method
by reconstructing the female population of Burkina Faso from 1960 to 2000. Wheldon et al.
(2013a) extended Bayesian reconstruction to countries with censuses at irregular intervals
and showed that it works well across a wide range of data quality contexts by reconstructing the female populations of Laos, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand. Laos is a country with
very little vital registration data where population estimation depends largely on surveys,
Sri Lanka has some vital registration data, and New Zealand is a country with high-quality
registration data. In this paper we focus on countries which lack good vital registration data
or for which there are gaps in, or inconsistencies among, the available data sources.
Global sex ratio in the total population (SRTP), defined as the ratio of the number of
males per female, has risen slightly from about 1.00 in 1950 to 1.02 in 2010. There is a
great deal of variation among regions, however. For instance, SRTP in the more developed
regions ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 over this period, while in less developed regions it remained
constant at about 1.04. In Eastern Asia, which includes China, and in Southern Asia, which
includes India, SRTPs ranged from 1.05 to 1.06 and from 1.09 to 1.06, respectively (UN,
2011). Guilmoto (2007b) claimed that the population of Asia underwent “masculinization”
during the latter half of the twentieth century, with one likely consequence being a “marriage
squeeze” (Guilmoto, 2009, 2012) wherein many males will be unable to find a wife. Imbalances in population sex ratios are caused by imbalances in sex ratios at birth (SRBs) and
sex ratios of mortality (SRMs) (Guillot, 2002). These quantities have received considerable
attention in the literature on the demography of Asia (e.g. Bhat, 2002b,c; Bongaarts, 2001;
Coale, 1991; Das Gupta, 2005; Guilmoto, 2009; Mayer, 1999; Sen, 1990). Sawyer (2012)
called for further work to quantify uncertainty in estimates of SRMs. Estimates of the SRB
are subject to a large amount of uncertainty, especially in India (Bhat, 2002b,c; Guillot,
2002; Guilmoto, 2009). Here, we respond by quantifying uncertainty in these parameters.
The article is organized as follows. In the remainder of this section we provide some background on existing methods of population reconstruction and the demography of sex ratios
in Asia. In Section 2 we describe the two-sex version of Bayesian reconstruction. In Section 3 we present results from our case studies of India, Thailand and Laos. We focus mainly
on posterior distributions of total fertility rate (TFR), SRBs and the sex difference in life
expectancy. Certain sex ratios in India are widely believed to be atypical so we devote more
attention to this case. Sensitivity to aspects of the prior based primarily on expert opinion
is investigated. We end with a discussion in Section 4 which provides further demographic
context and an overall conclusion. Selected mathematical derivations, further details about
data sources and results for additional parameters such as sex ratio of under-five mortality

2

rate, population sex ratios and net international migration, are in the appedices. Bayesian
reconstruction is implemented in the “popReconstruct” package for the R environment for
statistical computing (R Core Team, 2013).

1.1

Methods of Population Reconstruction

In human demography, population reconstruction is often referred to simply as “estimation”
to distinguish it from forecasts of future population counts and vital rates. Instead we use
“reconstruction” to avoid ambiguity. Nevertheless, use of “estimation” agrees with its usage
in statistics, namely the estimation of the values of some unknown quantities from data.
Reviews of existing methods of population reconstruction are given by Oeppen (1993a),
Barbi et al. (2004), and Wheldon et al. (2013b). Many were developed for the purpose of
reconstructing populations of the distant past from data on births, deaths and marriages
recorded in parish registers (e.g,. Bertino and Sonnino, 2003; Walters, 2008; Wrigley and
Schofield, 1981), or in counterfactual exercises to estimate the excess of mortality due to
extreme events such as famine or genocide (e.g., Boyle and Ó Gráda, 1986; Daponte et al.,
1997; Goodkind and West, 2001; Heuveline, 1998; Merli, 1998) or the number of “missing
women” due to male-dominated sex ratios in Asia (Coale, 1991; Das Gupta, 2005; Sen, 1990).
Purely deterministic reconstruction methods used in some of these studies include “inverse
projection” (Lee, 1971, 1974), “back projection” (Wrigley and Schofield, 1981) and “generalized back projection” (Oeppen, 1993b). Bertino and Sonnino (2003) proposed “stochastic
inverse projection”. This is a non-deterministic method but the only form of uncertainty is
that which comes from treating birth and death as stochastic processes at the individual
level. Counts of births and deaths are assumed to be known without error and age patterns
are fixed. In the cases we treat, accurate data on births and deaths of the parish register
kind are often unavailable and uncertainty due to stochastic vital rates is likely to be small
relative to uncertainty due to measurement error (Cohen, 2006; Lee, 2003; Pollard, 1968).
Moreover, it is designed to work with the kind of data commonly available for developing
countries and does not rely on the existence of detailed births and deaths registers, although
this information can be used when available (Wheldon et al., 2013a).
Daponte et al. (1997) took a fully Bayesian approach to constructing a counterfactual
history of the Iraqi Kurdish population from 1977 to 1990. They constructed prior distributions for fertility and mortality rates using survey data and expert opinion about uncertainty
based on historical information and knowledge of demographic processes. Measurement error
in the available, fragmentary data was accounted for. However, there were some restrictions
such as holding the age pattern of fertility fixed and allowing for mortality variation only
through infant mortality. Rural to urban migration was accounted for by treating these
3

populations separately; international migration was assumed to be negligible. Bayesian reconstruction is similar, but no model age patterns are assumed to hold and international
migration is explicitly estimated along with fertility, mortality and population counts.
Most methods of population reconstruction in demography employ the cohort component
model of population projection (CCMPP) in some form. Population projection uses vital
rates and migration to project a set of age-specific population counts in the baseline year,
denoted t0 , forward in time to the end year, denoted T . In its simplest form, the population
in year t+δ, t0 ≤ t ≤ T −δ, equals the population in year t plus the intervening births and net
migration, minus the intervening deaths (e.g., Preston et al., 2001; Whelpton, 1936). This
is known as the demographic balancing equation. Population projection is distinct from
population forecasting since it merely entails evolving a population forward in time from
some given baseline under assumptions about prevailing vital rates and migration (Keyfitz
and Caswell, 2005). The period of projection may be in the future or in the past. Wheldon
et al. (2013a,b) employed single-sex population projection in this way to reconstruct femaleonly populations taking account of measurement error. In this article we show how twosex population projection can be used to reconstruct full populations, thereby providing
estimates of population sex ratios, SRBs and SRMs simultaneously while accounting for
measurement error.

1.2

Estimating Sex Ratios

Methods of reporting sex ratios are not standardized. Here we adopt the convention that all
ratios are “male-per-female”; in the Indian literature the inverse is more common. Hence,
SRTP is the total number of males per female in the population and SRB is the number of
male births per female birth. The SRM can be expressed using various mortality indicators.
We will use the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) exclusively (see the Appendix for a formal
definition). A low SRM means that mortality is lower among males than among females. Allage mortality is summarized by life expectancy at birth, for which the standard demographic
abbreviation is e0 . Comparison of e0 by sex is more commonly done using the difference than
the ratio and we adopt that convention here. Male e0 is subtracted from female e0 to obtain
the difference.
Under typical conditions, SRBs for most countries are in the range 1.04–1.06 (UNFPA,
2010). Estimates of SRB in some regions in Asia are higher; the National Family Health
Survey in India estimated SRB over 2000–2006 to be 1.09, for example (Guilmoto, 2009).
For almost all countries, e0 is higher for females than males. This is thought to be due to
a range of biological and environmental factors, with the relative contribution of each class
of factor varying among countries (Waldron, 1985). Age-specific SRMs are more variable as
4

they are affected by sex-specific causes of death such as those associated with child birth.
The preferred way of estimating SRBs and SRMs at the national level is from counts of births
and deaths recorded in official registers (vital registration) together with total population
counts from censuses. In many countries where such registers are not kept, surveys such
as the Demographic and Health Surveys and World Fertility Surveys must be used. These
typically ask a sample of women about their birth histories. Full birth histories collect
information about the times of each birth and, if the child subsequently died, the time of the
death. Summary birth histories ask only about the total number of births and child deaths
the respondent has ever experienced (Preston et al., 2001; UN, 1983).
Estimates based on both vital registration and surveys are susceptible to systematic biases
and non-systematic measurement error. Counts of births or deaths from vital registration
may be biased downward by the omission of events from the register or under-coverage of the
target population. Full birth histories are susceptible to biases caused by omission of births
or misreporting of the timing of events. Some omissions may be deliberate in order to avoid
lengthy subsections of the survey (Hill, You, et al., 2012). Fertility and mortality estimates
from summary birth histories are derived using so-called indirect techniques such as the Brass
P/F ratio method (Brass, 1964; Feeney, 1996; UN, 1983). In addition to the biases affecting
full birth histories, estimates based on summary birth histories can also be affected when the
assumptions behind the indirect methods are not satisfied. These assumptions concern the
pattern of mortality by age and the association between mother and child mortality. They
often do not hold, for example, in populations experiencing rapid mortality decline (Silva,
2012).
In the absence of vital registration, estimates of adult mortality may be based on reports
of sibling survival histories collected in surveys. Often however, the only data available are on
child mortality collected from surveys of women. In such cases, estimates of adult mortality
are extrapolations based on model life tables (Preston et al., 2001; UN, 1983). Model life
tables are families of life tables generated from mortality data collected from a wide range of
countries over a long period of time. They are indexed by a summary parameter such as e0
or U5MR and are grouped into regions. The Coale and Demeny system (Coale et al., 1983;
Preston, 1976) and the United Nations (UN) system for developing countries (UN, 1982)
both have five families. Errors in estimates of adult mortality derived in this way come from
errors in the survey-based estimates of under five mortality and the inability of the model
life table family to capture the true mortality patterns in the population of interest.
Concerns about the accuracy of SRB estimates, particularly for periods between 1950
and 1970, have led some authors to suggest using age-specific population sex ratios as a
proxy for SRBs. Guilmoto (2009) suggests the male-to-female ratio among those aged 0–4

5

(the “child sex ratio”) and Bhat (2002b) suggests the ratio among those aged 0–14 for India
(the “juvenile sex ratio”). Such ratios must be estimated from census data which is probably
more reliable than survey data, but still subject to age misreporting and underreporting
of certain groups. For example, there appears to have been under counting of females in
censuses of India (Bhat, 2002b,c; Guillot, 2002). In our case study, we estimate the child
sex ratio for India between 1971 and 2001.
Estimates of fertility, mortality, migration and population counts, and the implied sex
ratios for successive quinquennia are all related to one another via the demographic balancing
equation that underlies the CCMPP. The estimates of these quantities published in WPP
must be “projection consistent” in that the age-specific population counts for year t must
be the counts one gets by projecting the published counts for year t − 5 forward using the
published fertility, mortality and migration rates.
Bias reduction techniques are source- and parameter-specific. For birth history data,
these might involve omitting responses of very old women, or responses pertaining to events
in the distant past. For census counts, adjustments may be made to compensate for wellknown undercounts in certain age-sex groups. In other cases, parametric models of life
tables, or specially constructed life tables, may be used if available. For this reason we do
not propose a generally applicable method of bias reduction, one which would work well for
all parameters and data sources, since many specialized ones already exist (e.g., Alkema,
Raftery, et al., 2012; Murray, Ferguson, et al., 2003; Murray, Rajaratnam, et al., 2010; UN,
1983). Bayesian reconstruction takes as input bias-reduced initial estimates of age-specific
fertility rates and age- and sex-specific initial estimates of mortality, international migration
and population counts. Measurement error is accounted for by modelling these quantities as
probability distributions. Projection consistency is achieved by embedding the CCMPP in
a Bayesian hierarchical model. Inference is based on the joint posterior distribution of the
input parameters, which is sampled from using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
Under the current UN procedure, all available representative data sources for a given
country are considered and techniques to reduce bias are applied where UN analysts deem
them appropriate. Projection consistency is achieved through an iterative “project-andadjust” process. SRBs and SRMs are inputs to the procedure, while population sex ratios
are calculated using estimate population counts, which are an output.

Method

2.1

Notation and Parameters

The parameters of interest are age- and time-specific vital rates, net international migration
flows, population counts and SRB. The symbols n, s, g and f denote population counts,
survival (a measure of mortality), net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) and fertility,
respectively. All of these parameters will be indexed by five-year increments of age, denoted
by a, and time, denoted by t. The parameters n, s and g will also be indexed by sex, denoted
by l = F, M , where F and M indicate female and male, respectively. SRB is defined as the
number of male births for every female birth. It will be indexed by time.
Reconstruction will be done over the time interval [t0 , T ]. The age scale runs from 0
to A > 0; in our applications A is 80. The total number of age-groups is denoted K. To
[fert]

[fert]

model fertility, we define aL ≤ aU , where fertility is assumed to be zero at ages out[fert] [fert]
side the range [aL , aU + 5). Throughout, a prime indicates vector transpose. We will
use boldface for vectors and a “·” to indicate the indices whose entire range is contained
therein. Multiple indices are stacked in the order a, t, l. For example, n·,t0 ,F is the vector of age-specific female population counts in exact year t0 , [n0,t0 ,F , · · · , nA,t0 ,F ]0 and n·,·,· =
[n0,t0 ,F , · · · , nA,t0 ,F , n0,t0 +5,F , · · · , nA,t0 +5,F , · · · n0,T,F , · · · , nA,T,F , · · · , n0,T,M , · · · , nA,T,M ]0 .
The parameters are the standard demographic parameters used for projection. The
fertility parameters, fa,t , are age-, time-specific occurrence/exposure rates. They give the
ratio of the number of babies born over the period [t, t + 5) to the number of person-years
lived over this period by women in the age range [a, a + 5). If a woman survives for the
whole quinquennium she contributes five person-years to the denominator; if she survives
only for the first year and a half she contributes 1.5 person-years, and so forth. The survival
parameters, sa,t,l , are age-, time-, and sex-specific proportions. They give the proportion of
those alive at time t that survive for five years. The age subscript on the survival parameters
indicates the age-range the women will survive into. For example, the number of females
aged [15, 20) alive in 1965 would be the product (n10,1960,F )(s15,1960,F ) (ignoring migration
for simplicity). It also means that s0,1960.F is the proportion of female births born during
1960–1965 that are alive in 1965, hence aged 0–5. The oldest age-group is open-ended and
we must allow for survival in this age group. Thus, the proportion aged [A, ∞) at time t
that survives through the interval [t, t + 5) is denoted by sA+5,t,l . Migration is also expressed
as a proportion. The net number of male migrants aged [a, a + 5) over the interval [t, t + 5)
is (na,t,M )(ga,t,M ).

2.2

Projection of Two-Sex Populations

The CCMPP allows one to calculate the number alive by age and sex at any time, t =
t0 + 5, . . . , T , using n·,t0 ,· , the vector of age- and sex-specific female and male population
counts at baseline t0 , and the age-, time-, sex-specific vital rates and migration up to time t.
The vector of counts n·,t,· is simply n·,t0 ,· plus the intervening births, minus the deaths, plus
net migration. Projection is a discrete time approximation to a continuous time process,
and several adjustments are made to improve accuracy. The form we use has two-steps;
projection is done first for those aged 5 and above, n5+,t,l and then for those under five,
n0,t,l . To this end, let us write
n·,t,· =

h

n0,t,F , n5+ ,t,F

where vectors and matrices are partitioned according to sex for clarity.
The number alive at exact time t + 5 aged 5 and above is then given by the following
matrix multiplication:

The symbol “◦” indicates the Hadamard (or element-wise) product; n5+ ,t,l , l = F, M , are
(K − 1) × 1 vectors containing the age-specific female and male population counts at exact
time t; and g 5+ ,t,l , l = F, M , are (K − 1) × 1 vectors of age-specific female and male net
migration expressed as a proportion of the population. The matrices L 5+ ,t,F and L 5+ ,t,M are
(K − 1) × K matrices of survival proportions for females and males at ages 5 and above, and
0 is a (K − 1) × K matrix of zeros (the “L” is for Leslie 1945, 1948). The female and male
survival matrices have the same form:

Splitting migration in half and adding the first half at the beginning of the projection interval
and the second half at the end is a standard approximation to improve the discrete time
approximation (Preston et al., 2001).
The number of females and males alive aged [0, 5) in exact year t + 5 is derived from the
total number of births over the interval, bt , where

The term in braces is an approximation to the number of person-years lived by women of
child-bearing age over the projection interval. The total number of each sex aged [0, 5) alive
at the end of the interval is computed from bt using under five mortality, migration and SRB:
n0,t+5,F = bt
n0,t+5,M = bt

(6)

Note that the fa,t in (5) have only two subscripts; they are the age-specific (female)
fertility rates introduced above. Thus the total number of births in the projection interval
is a function of the number of females of reproductive age, but not of the number of males
of any age, or of females of other ages. This is called “female dominant projection”. This
approach is preferred to alternatives, such as basing fertility on the number of male personyears lived, because survey-based fertility data are often collected by interviewing mothers,
not fathers. All-sex births are computed first and then decomposed because SRB is often a
parameter of interest to demographers, as it is to us here (Preston et al., 2001).

2.3

Modelling Uncertainty

In many countries, the available data on vital rates and migration are fragmentary and subject to systematic biases and non-systematic measurement error. Wheldon et al. (2013b)
proposed Bayesian reconstruction as a way of estimating past vital rates, migration and
population counts for a single-sex population, which accounts for measurement error. Systematic biases are treated in a pre-processing step which yields a set of bias-reduced “initial
estimates” for each age-, time-specific fertility rate, survival and migration proportion and
∗
is the
population counts. We use an asterisk (“∗ ”) to denote initial estimates. Hence fa,t

initial estimate of fa,t . At the heart of Bayesian reconstruction is a hierarchical model which
takes the initial estimates as inputs. Here, we present a substantial development of the
model given in Wheldon et al. (2013b) which allows estimation of two-sex populations.
Take t0 and T to be the years for which the earliest and most recent bias adjusted
census-based population counts are available (henceforth, we refer to these simply as census counts). Years following t0 for which census counts are also available are denoted by
[cen]
[cen]
t0 < tL , . . . , tU < T . Let θ be the vector of all age-, time- and sex-specific fertility
rates, survival and migration proportions over the period [t0 , T ), the SRBs, and the age- and
sex-specific census counts in year t0 . These are the inputs required by the CCMPP. We abbreviate CCMPP by M (·). Let ψ t be the components of θ corresponding to time t, excluding
nt0 . Therefore, θ = [n0·,t0 ,· , f 0·,·,· , s0·,·,· , g 0·,·,· , SRB 0· ]0 and ψ t = [f 0·,t,· , s0·,t,· , g 0·,t,· , SRB 0t ]0 .

to ensure a non-negative population. Wheldon et al.’s (2013) female-only model had SRB
fixed at 1.05 and l = F . SRB can be interpreted as the odds that a birth is male, so (9) is
a model for the log-odds that a birth is male.
The hyper parameters αv , βv , v = n, f, s, g, SRB define the distribution of the variance parameters that represent measurement error in the initial estimates. We set these parameters
based on the expert opinion of UNPD analysts by eliciting liberal, but realistic, estimates of
initial estimate accuracy. We elicit on the observable marginal quantities, fa,t , sa,t,l , ga,t,l , and
na,t,l . On their respective transformed scales, these have Student’s t distributions centred at
the initial point estimates and variance and degrees of freedom dependent on α and β. We
set αv = 0.5, v = f, s, n, g, SRB , which gives the initial estimates a weight equivalent to a
single data point. The βv are then determined by specifying the limits of the central 90percent probability interval of the untransformed marginal distributions. Population counts,
10

fertility rates and SRB are modelled on the log scale so this amounts to making a statement
of the form “the probability that the true parameter values are within ηv × 100 percent of
the initial point estimates is 90 percent”, v = f, n, SRB . Migration is explicitly modelled as
a proportion so this interpretation is direct for migration. The survival parameters are also
proportions but they are modelled on the logit scale. We set βs such that the untransformed
sa,t,l lie within the elicited intervals. In all cases, we call ηv , v = f, s, n, g, SRB , the elicited
relative error.
Bayesian reconstruction defines a joint prior distribution over the input parameters (9)–
(15) which induces a prior on the population counts after the baseline via CCMPP. This is
“updated” using the census counts for which a likelihood is given in (7). Some methods of
estimating migration rely on “residual” counts; projected counts based only on vital rates
are compared with census counts and the difference attributed to international migration.
Methods of adjusting vital rates and census counts to ensure mutual consistency have also
been proposed that use a similar approach (e.g., Luther, Dhanasakdi, et al., 1986; Luther and
∗

, s∗a,t,l , ga,t,l
Retherford, 1988). Initial estimates of fa,t

since this would amount to using the data twice and uncertainty would be underestimated
in the posterior.

Application

We apply two-sex Bayesian reconstruction to the populations of India from 1971–2001, Thailand from 1960–2000 and Laos from 1985–2005. The periods of reconstruction are determined
by the available data. Laos has no vital registration data. Initial estimates of fertility are
based on surveys of women and the only mortality estimates are for ages under five derived
from these same surveys. Thailand and India have acceptable vital registration data for
these periods which provide information about fertility and mortality at all ages. Nevertheless, adjustments are necessary to reduce bias due to undercount of certain groups. For
example, vital registration is thought to have underestimated U5MR in Thailand (Hill, Vapattanawong, et al., 2007; Vapattanawong and Prasartkul, 2011) and in India 50–60 percent
of children are born at home which increases the likelihood of omission from the register
(UNFPA, 2010).
Estimates of population sex ratios in India have been relatively high throughout the
twentieth century. Prior to the late 1970s, these were thought to have been caused by an
excess of female mortality (high SRMs), and from the late 1970s onward by high SRBs.
Both of these phenomena have been linked to cultural preferences for sons over daughters
which were intensified by a rapid fall in fertility rates (Bhat, 2002b,c; Das Gupta, 2005;

11

Guilmoto, 2007a; Visaria, 1971). Concern over the accuracy of certain estimates of SRB has
led some authors to suggest using the SRTP and sex ratios for young age groups as proxies
for SRB and SRMs (Bhat, 2002b,c; Guilmoto, 2009). We use Bayesian reconstruction to
derive credible intervals for the SRTP and the sex ratio among those aged 0–5 for India.
Thailand experienced an even more rapid decline in TFR between 1960 and about 1980
(Kamnuansilpa et al., 1982). Estimates of Thailand’s SRBs between 1960 and about 1970
are relatively high, but are within the typical range from about 1970 to 2000. Surveys of
Thai families in the 1970s found that girls and boys were desired about equally (Guilmoto,
2009; Knodel, Ruffolo, et al., 1996).
Fertility rates in Laos have fallen since 1985 but remain high relative to other Asian
countries. Very little has been written about sex ratios for this country (but see Frisen,
1991).
In the remainder of this section, we briefly describe the data sources for each country and
the method used to derive initial estimates. More details are in the appendices. These are
followed by results for selected parameters. We focus on key details and the most interesting
outputs; further results, including those for migration, can be found in the appendices.
All computations were done using the R environment for statistical computing (R Core
Team, 2013); Bayesian reconstruction is implemented in the package “popReconstruct”. The
method of Raftery and Lewis (1996) was used to select the length of MCMC chains.

3.1.1

Data Sources and Initial Estimates
India, 1971–2001

Censuses have been taken roughly every 10 years in India since 1871. We begin our period of
reconstruction in 1971. This is the first census year for which vital rate data independent of
the censuses are available, collected by the Indian Sample Registration System. Subsequent
censuses were taken in 1981, 1991 and 2001 (sufficiently detailed results from the 2011 census
were not available at the time of writing). Counts in WPP 2010 were used as these were
adjusted to reduce bias. Estimates of SRB, fertility and survival were based on data from
the Sample Registration System (The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India,
2011), the National Family Health Surveys conducted between 1992 and 2006 (The Registrar
General and Census Commissioner of India, 2009) and the 2002–04 Reproductive Child
Health Survey. Weighted cubic splines were used to smooth estimates of SRB and fertility.
The same initial estimates for migration were used for India as for Laos and Thailand and the
elicited relative errors were also the same; see below. The elicited relative error of 10 percent
for the vital rates and SRB is consistent with independent assessments of the coverage of
the Sample Registration System (Bhat, 2002a; Mahapatra, 2010).
12

3.1.2

Thailand, 1960–2000

Censuses were conducted in 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 (detailed results from the census
conducted in 2010 were not available at the time of writing). We used the counts in WPP
2010 which were adjusted for known biases such as undercount. Initial estimates of sex ratio
at birth were taken from current fertility based on vital registration. The elicited relative
error was set to 10 percent. Initial estimates of age-specific fertility were based on direct and
indirect estimates of current fertility and children ever born (CEB) based on the available
data including surveys and vital registration. Each data series was normalized to give the
age pattern and summed to give TFR. These were smoothed separately using weighted cubic
splines and the resulting estimates combined to yield a single series of initial estimates of
age-specific fertility rates, in the same manner as for India. The weights were determined by
UN analysts based on their expert judgement about the relative reliability of each source.
The elicited relative error was set to 10 percent. Initial estimates of survival for both sexes
were based on life tables calculated from vital registration, adjusted for undercount using
data from surveys. We used the same initial estimates of international migration as for Laos;
see below.
3.1.3

Laos, 1985–2004

National censuses were conducted in 1985, 1995 and 2005, so we reconstruct the whole
population between 1985 and 2005. We used Wheldon et al.’s (2013) initial estimates for
fertility, female mortality, migration and population counts. In these, migration was centred
at zero for all sexes, ages and quinquennia, with a large relative error of 20 percent. Initial
estimates for males were derived in an analogous manner. There was very little information
about the sex ratio at birth, so initial estimates were set at 1.05, a demographic convention
(Preston et al., 2001), with a large elicited relative error of 20 percent.

3.2

Results

Key results are given by country; more results are presented in the appendices . We show
the limits of central 95 percent credible intervals for the marginal prior and posterior distributions of selected parameters. The magnitude of uncertainty will be summarized using
half-widths of these intervals, averaged over age, time, and sex. We compare our results to
those published in WPP 2010 for years with comparable estimates. WPP 2010 did not use
Bayesian reconstruction but it is based on the same data, so the comparison is useful.

13

3.2.1

India, 1971–2001

Figures 1a and 1b show posterior 95 percent intervals for TFR and SRB for India. Median
TFR decreased consistently and the posterior intervals have half-width 0.11 children per
woman. The marginal posterior for SRB is centred above the range 1.04–1.06 from 1976–
2001, which suggests that SRBs might have been atypically high over this period. There
also appears to have been an increase in SRB over the same period. Under Bayesian reconstruction, the posterior probabilities of these events can be estimated in a straightforward
manner from the posterior sample. The posterior probabilities that SRB exceeded 1.06 in
each of the quinquennia are in Table 1a. Strong evidence for high SRB was found for the
period 1991–2001.
To investigate the trend further we looked at the posterior distributions of two measures
of linear increase: 1) the difference between SRBs in the first and last quinquennia; and 2)
the slope coefficient in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of SRB on the start year
of each quinquennium. Each quantity was calculated separately for each SRB trajectory
in the posterior sample. Some actual trajectories are shown in Figure 1b. These measures
summarize the posterior obtained from the reconstruction in simple ways; linear regression
models were not used to obtain the sample from the posterior. The probabilities that the
simple difference and slope coefficient were greater than zero are 0.92 and 0.93 respectively
(Table 2a).

Results for e0 are shown in Figure 2. Life expectancy at birth increased for both sexes
over the period of reconstruction (Figure 2a) but the sex difference suggests that female e0
might have increased more rapidly than male e0 and even exceeded it in the period 1996–2001
(Figure 2c). The mean interval half-width for the sex difference in life expectancies is 1.7
years. The posterior probabilities that female e0 exceeded male e0 support this (Table 1b).
The possibility of an increase in the female−male difference in e0 was investigated using the
same method applied to SRB. The probability of an increase between 1971 and 2001 is 0.98
and the probability that the slope is greater than zero is 0.98 (Table 2b); strong evidence of
a positive time trend.
Population sex ratios are shown in Figure 3a. The probability of a decrease in SRTP
is 1 and the probability that the OLS slope was less than zero is 1 (Table 2c); very strong
evidence for a decline over the period of reconstruction. Sex ratios in the population under
five (SRU5s) increased in the WPP population counts, but our posterior median remained
relatively constant after an initial decline. The probability that the sex ratio declined is 0.8;.
the probability that the OLS coefficient was negative is 0.71 (Table 2d). Mean half-widths
of the intervals for SRTP and the sex ratio in ages 0–5 are 0.01 and 0.027 respectively.
Uncertainty is higher in years without a census.

Using the sex ratio, the probability that female U5MR exceeded that of males ranged
from 0.72 to 0.89 over the period of reconstruction. Evidence of a linear trend was not found.

Thailand, 1960–2000

Total fertility rate fell very steeply in Thailand from 1960–2000 (Figure 4a). Posterior
uncertainty about this parameter is small; the mean half-width of the posterior intervals is
0.07 children per woman.
Ninety five percent credible intervals for SRB contain the typical range of 1.04–1.06 for
all but the first two quinquennia (Figure 4b). The probability that SRB exceeded 1.06
in each period is given in Table 3. There is strong evidence that SRBs were atypically
high in the period 1960–1969. The time trend for SRB appears to be curvilinear, hence
the simple linear summaries used to analyze the trend in Indian SRB are not appropriate
here. Piecewise linear regression models are available (e.g., Hinkley, 1969; Hinkley, 1971),
but each trajectory in the posterior sample consists of only eight values and they are quite
volatile. These characteristics make identification of a change point difficult. Instead we
partition the period of reconstruction into two sub-periods, 1960–1984 and 1985–2000, and
summarize the time trend with the following two difference quantities: SRB1960 − SRB1980
and SRB1985 − SRB1995 (the subscripts indicate the start years of the quinquennia). The
posterior joint probability of a decrease from 1960 to 1984 followed by an increase to 1995–
1999 (i.e., Pr({SRB1960 − SRB1980 > 0} ∩ {SRB1985 − SRB1995 < 0})) is 0.84.

the difference: 2.4 years). There is also strong evidence for a positive trend; the probability
that the simple difference (1995 period minus 1960 period) in the sex differences in e0 was
greater than 0 is 0.96 and the probability that the OLS slope is greater than 0 is 1 (Table 4).
The posterior for sex ratio of under-five mortality rate (SRU5MR) suggests that mortality
at ages 0–5 was similar for both sexes. In no quinquennium is there convincing evidence for
a male-to-female ratio less than one. Similarly there is not strong evidence for a linear trend
in this parameter over the period of reconstruction. Details are in the appendices along with
results for net international migration and population sex ratios.

Laos, 1985–2004

Medians and prior and posterior credible intervals for TFR and SRB are shown in Figure 6.
The posterior for TFR obtained here (Figure 6a) is very similar that obtained by Wheldon
et al. (2013a) who reconstructed the female-only population and did not estimate SRB; it
was kept fixed at 1.05 throughout, a demographic convention (Preston et al., 2001).
There was very little data on SRB for Laos therefore, in this study, the initial estimate
of SRB was fixed at 1.05 in all quinquennia but a posterior distribution was estimated using
the model. The posterior median SRB deviates very little from the initial estimate, although
the uncertainty has been considerably reduced; the mean of the half-widths of the 95 percent
credible intervals is 0.038 compared with 0.39 for the prior (Figure 6b). The probability that
SRB was above 1.06 in any of the quinquennia is low (Table 5) and the evidence for a trend
over time is equivocal (Table 6).
There is strong evidence that female e0 was higher from 1990 through 2005 but there
appears to be no evidence for a sex difference between 1985 and 1990 (Figure 7, Table 5b).

Discussion

We have described Bayesian reconstruction for two-sex populations, a method of reconstructing human populations of the recent past which yields probabilistic estimates of uncertainty
(Wheldon et al., 2013a,b). We reconstructed the populations of Laos from 1985–2005, Thai21

land from 1960–2000 and India from 1971–2001, paying particular attention to sex ratios
of fertility and mortality indicators. We estimate that the posterior probability that SRB
was above 1.06 is greater than 0.9 in India between 1991 and 2001 and the probability it
increased over this period is about 0.92. The SRB was also above 1.06 with high posterior probability in Thailand from 1960–1970. We estimate that the probability it decreased
between 1960 and 1980, then increased from 1985 to 2000, is 0.84. We found no evidence
for atypically high SRBs, or a trend over the period of reconstruction, for Laos, a country
with much less available data than Thailand and India. In both Thailand and Laos, we
found strong evidence that e0 was greater for females and, in Thailand, that the difference
increased over the period of reconstruction. In India, the probability that female e0 was
lower during 1971–1976 was 0.79 but there was strong evidence for a narrowing of the gap
through to 2001.
In its original formulation, Bayesian reconstruction was for female-only populations; here
we show how two-sex populations can be reconstructed using the same framework. The
method takes a set of data-derived, bias-reduced initial estimates of age-specific fertility
rates, and age-sex-specific survival proportions, migration proportions and population counts
from censuses, together with expert opinion on the measurement error informed by data if
available. Bayesian reconstruction updates initial estimates using adjusted census counts via
a Bayesian hierarchical model. The periods of reconstruction used in our applications begin
in the earliest census year for which non-census vital rate data were available, and end with
the year of the most recent census. Reconstruction can be done further ahead, but without
a census the results are based purely on the initial estimates.

(Section 2.3), and so the posterior will be sensitive to changes in these inputs. This is actually
desirable, because the initial estimates are based heavily on data specific to that estimate;
the posterior should be sensitive to changes in these data.
Information about measurement error variance is needed to set the model hyper parameters (14). In our case studies, this took the form of expert opinion, elicited as 90percent
probability intervals centred at the data-derived initial estimates. If available, additional
data on measurement error could be used to inform the elicitations, or to replace them altogether if they are comprehensive enough. This is the case in many developed countries (e.g.,
New Zealand, Wheldon et al. (2013a)), where post-census enumeration surveys and vital
registration coverage studies are undertaken. However, we expect Bayesian reconstruction
to be most useful for less developed and developing countries where fragmentary and unreliable data lead to a substantial amount of uncertainty. For these countries, expert opinion
is a main source of information. We do expect the posterior to be somewhat sensitive to
the elicited intervals since the initial estimates themselves do not contain much information
about measurement error.
Previous methods of population reconstruction were purely deterministic, were not designed to work with the type of data commonly available for many countries over the last
sixty years, or did not account for measurement error (e.g., Bertino and Sonnino, 2003; Lee,
1971, 1974; Wrigley and Schofield, 1981). Daponte et al. (1997) used a Bayesian approach
to construct a counterfactual population, but age patterns of fertility were held fixed and
mortality varied only through infant mortality. Bayesian reconstruction does not impose
fixed age-patterns and mortality can vary at each age. Moreover, international migration is
estimated in the same way as fertility and mortality.
We considered sex ratios of births and mortality because these are of interest to demographers and policy-makers, especially since they determine the SRTP (Griffiths et al., 2000;
Guillot, 2002). It is conventional to compare sex-specific U5MRs with a ratio but sex-specific
e0 s with a difference. We have not studied the associations among U5MR ratios, e0 differences and population sex ratios. The SRTP is a function of life-time cohort mortality but
the U5MR and e0 presented here are period measures for which the relationship used by
Guillot (2002) does not hold. Our results add to previous work on SRMs, especially that of
Sawyer (2012) who studied sex ratios of U5MR and called for further work to quantify its
uncertainty. Sawyer (2012) decomposed U5MR into mortality between ages 0 and 1 (infant
mortality) and mortality between ages 1 and 5 (child mortality). We reconstructed populations in age- time-intervals of width five because these are the intervals for which data is
most widely available across all countries.
Many methods of adjusting vital registration using census data have been proposed (e.g.,

24

Bennett and Horiuchi, 1981; Hill, 1987; Luther and Retherford, 1988), but these deal with
intercensal migrations by essentially truncating the age groups most affected by migration
(Murray, Rajaratnam, et al., 2010), or ignore them altogether. Luther, Dhanasakdi, et al.
(1986) and Hill, Vapattanawong, et al. (2007) applied these methods to Thailand to estimate
undercounts. The aim of these methods is to produce improved point estimates of vital
rates. We have not used any census data to derive our initial estimates. For example, initial
estimates of survival were not based on inter-censal cohort survival and initial estimates of
migration were not based on “residual” counts. Doing so would have amounted to using the
census data twice and would have underestimated the uncertainty. The outputs of Bayesian
reconstruction are interval estimates which quantify uncertainty probabilistically.

4.1

Sex Ratios in Asia

The SRTP is a crude measure of the balance of sexes in a population since it is not agespecific; sex ratios may be quite different among age groups, for example. Nevertheless, there
is a large literature devoted to estimating SRTPs and exploring the causes and consequences,
especially in Asia where SRTPs are the highest in the world (UN, 2011). A persistently high
sex ratio among younger cohorts could lead to a “marriage squeeze” in which many young
males will struggle to marry due to a lack of eligible females (Guilmoto, 2012). Formally,
high SRTPs are the result of high SRBs and life-time sex ratios of cohort mortality (Guillot,
2002). The relative effects of these two factors may vary by time and country.
A normal range for SRB is believed to be 1.04–1.06 (UNFPA, 2010); on average, slightly
more than half of all newborns are male. Concerns about quality, or a complete lack of data,
have made it difficult to accurately estimate SRBs in many Asian countries. Bayesian reconstruction of these populations quantifies the accuracy of SRB estimates probabilistically.
With very few exceptions, country-level e0 s for females exceed those of males. This
pattern is consistent with a female survival advantage; in virtually all contemporary human
populations, females age slower and live longer than males (Soliani and Luchetti, 2006; Vallin,
2006). Behavioural factors appear to play an important role, especially in developed countries
where the prevalence of harmful activities, such as smoking, consumption of alcohol, and risky
behaviour leading to accidental death, tends to be lower among women than among men
(Lalic and Raftery, 2012; Waldron, 1985, 2009). The persistence of lower male e0 across the
development spectrum suggests there are other factors as well. In less developed countries,
e0 is determined more by infant and child mortality. Pongou (2013) studied infant mortality
in Africa and found an association with parental characteristics extant prior to conception.
Biological, as well as behavioural, determinants have also been proposed but there is little
consensus on the specific mechanism (Austad, 2011). The only countries in which female
25

e0 is not higher are countries in Africa and some in South and Central Asia. The African
countries are those with generalized HIV epidemics where mortality due to AIDS changes
the typical sex difference in e0 (UN, 2011). Those in Asia include, most notably, India where
cultural preference for males is thought to be the major cause.
4.1.1

India

The SRTP in India has received considerable attention, particularly as an indicator of discrimination against women (UNFPA, 2010). Griffiths et al. (2000) showed that only slightly
elevated SRBs and SRMs at young ages are sufficient to produce the observed SRTP in
India, if they persist for a long period of time. The relative contribution of these two factors
may have varied over time. Bhat (2002c) and Guilmoto (2007a, 2009) argue that India experienced a transition in the 1970s whereby high SRB replaced low SRM as the cause of the
high SRTPs observed throughout the period (recall that a low SRM is a result of lower male
mortality). Evidence suggests that low SRMs were due to female neglect and infanticide. In
the 1970s, these practices gave way to sex selective abortion which raised the SRB instead.
The transition hypothesis is based on several pieces of evidence. Data suggest a possible
rise in SRB in India above the typical range of 1.04–1.06 in the mid 1980s (Guilmoto, 2007a).
In the 1970s, amniocentesis started to became available as a method for determining the sex
of a foetus and abortion was legalized. Ultrasonography, a less invasive way of determining
foetal sex, started to became available in many parts of India in the 1980s. In certain regions,
such as the northern states and highly urbanized areas, there is a long standing tradition of
preference for sons over daughters (Bongaarts, 2001; Mayer, 1999). The arrival of these new
technologies in this context appears to have led to an increase in sex selective abortions in
India (Bhat, 2002c; APCRSHR, 2007; Jha, Kesler, et al., 2011; Jha, Kumar, Vasa, et al.,
2006; UNFPA, 2010). The steep decline in Indian TFR, which began in the early 1970s,
could have increased the prevalence of such procedures. Several studies have found evidence
that SRB is higher at higher parities (birth orders), both in India (Bhat, 2002c; Das Gupta
and Bhat, 1997; Jha, Kesler, et al., 2011; Jha, Kumar, and Dhingra, 2006) and other Asian
countries (Das Gupta, 2005). The increase appears to be greater if none of the earlier births
were male. As TFR decreases so does the average family size, so the risk of having no sons
increases (Guilmoto, 2009). Therefore, in cultures where sons play important economic and
social functions, or where families benefit materially much more from the marriage of a son
than of a daughter, the incentive to use sex selective abortion increases (Guilmoto, 2009;
Mayer, 1999).
After combining all available data and including uncertainty, we estimate that the probability there was an increase in SRB between 1971 and 2001 is above 0.92. The probability
26

that female U5MR was higher over this period is estimated to be between 0.72 and 0.89, but
there was no evidence of a trend. Therefore, our results provide support for the SRB part
of the transition hypothesis but not the U5MR part.
Overall mortality decreased rapidly in India from about 1950 as infectious diseases were
brought under control, food security increased and health services became more widely available (Bhat, 2002c). Our results suggest that, after taking account of uncertainty, there was
an increase in e0 and a continual decrease in U5MR between 1971 and 2001 for both sexes.
Using Sample Registration System data, (Bhat, 2002c) noted that the decrease was greater
for females than males and our analysis of the change in the sex difference of e0 supports this;
we found that the probability that the difference increased over the period of reconstruction
is about 0.98. The probability of a decline in the SRTP was found to be similarly strong.
However, as with SRU5MR, there was little evidence for a trend in SRU5.
India’s large population makes it a very important case for the study of sex ratios in Asia
(Guilmoto, 2007a) and, like other authors (e.g., Guillot, 2002; UN, 2011), we have focused
on country level estimates only. However, where available, data suggest that there are large
regional variations in SRBs and population sex ratios, with estimates for urban areas and
northern states being much higher than other areas (Bhat, 2002c; Guilmoto, 2009; Jha,
Kesler, et al., 2011). Currently, Bayesian reconstruction is not able to produce sub-national
estimates, but could be extended to do so in the future.
4.1.2

Thailand

Like other parts of Asia, Thailand experienced rapid economic growth and a rapid fall in TFR
beginning in 1960. The TFR decline was accompanied by an increase in the widespread use
of modern contraceptive methods made available through government supported, voluntary
family planning programs (Kamnuansilpa et al., 1982; Knodel, 1987; Knodel, Ruffolo, et
al., 1996). Unlike India, Thailand is not considered to have had a high SRB (Guilmoto,
2009). Vital registration data, which formed the basis of our initial estimates, indicate
that SRB was high during the period 1960 to 1970, but remained within the typical range
thereafter. This is consistent with studies conducted after the early 1970s which found that
small families of two or three children consisting of at least one boy and one girl was the most
commonly desired configuration in Thailand. TFR decline in Thailand may have intensified
this preference (Knodel and Prachuabmoh, 1976; Knodel, Ruffolo, et al., 1996).
Posterior intervals for sex ratios of mortality in Thailand reflect the typical pattern which
is one of higher female life expectancy. There is no evidence that this pattern was also true
for U5MR (on-line resources).

27

4.1.3

Laos

Fertility in Laos remained high relative to its neighbours. For example, the estimated TFR
for 1985 in Laos is comparable to the 1960 estimate for Thailand (Frisen, 1991). Posterior
uncertainty about SRB is high and our results provide no evidence to suggest levels were
atypical between 1985 and 2005. All-age mortality as summarized by e0 does appear to have
been higher for females from 1990 onward but, as with Thailand, there is no evidence that
this advantage held for U5MR (on-line resources).

4.2

Further Work and Extensions

Our prior distributions were constructed from initial point estimates of the CCMPP input
parameters, together with information about measurement error. In the examples given
here, this was elicited from UN analysts who are very familiar with the data sources and
the demography of each country. In cases where good data on measurement error are available, they can be used. For example, Wheldon et al. (2013a) used information from postenumeration surveys to estimate the accuracy of New Zealand censuses. Data of this kind
are rarely available in developing countries for either census or vital rate data. Nevertheless,
surveys come with a substantial amount of meta-data which can be used to model accuracy. This approach was taken by Alkema, Raftery, et al. (2012) who developed a method
for estimating the quality of survey-based TFR estimates in West Africa by modelling bias
and measurement error variance as a function of data quality covariates. Wheldon et al.
(2013b) used these results in their reconstruction of the female population of Burkina Faso.
Extending this work to more countries could provide a source of initial estimates together
with uncertainty that could be used as inputs to Bayesian reconstruction.
Posterior uncertainty in estimates of U5MR was found to be substantial and we did not
find strong evidence for a skewed sex ratio in any of our examples. U5MR is under-identified
in the model because the only census count it affects, that for ages 0–5, is also dependent on
SRB and TFR. Recent work by the UN Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation
(IGME) has focused on producing probabilistic estimates of U5MR (Alkema and Ann, 2011;
Hill, You, et al., 2012). Further work could look at ways of using these estimates in Bayesian
reconstruction to improve estimation of U5MR.
The census counts we used were not raw census output but adjusted counts published in
WPP. In some cases, these counts are adjusted by the UNPD to reduce bias due to factors
such differential undercount by age. This may have led to an underestimate of uncertainty.
The use of raw census outputs instead is worth investigating, but the effects of undercount
would still need to be addressed through modifications to the method.

28

Our prior distributions for international migration were centred at zero with large variances. This is a sensible default when accurate data are not available. Further work could
investigate the possibility of using stocks of foreign-born, often collected in censuses, to provide more accurate initial estimates. Data on refugee movements is another source that
could be investigated where available.
We have reconstructed national level populations only, principally because this is the
level at which the UN operate. We have already mentioned that sub-national reconstructions
might be of interest. Subnational reconstructions could be done without any modifications to
the method if the requisite data are available; national level initial estimates and population
counts would just be replaced with their subnational equivalents and the method applied
as above. Reconstructing adjacent regions, or regions between which there is likely to be
a lot of migration would require special care, however, as there is no way of accounting for
dependence among migratory flows under the current approach.

Under 5 Mortality Rate

The U5MR is constructed in the same way as the standard “Infant Mortality Rate” (e.g.,
Preston et al., 2001, Ch. 2), except for the age interval [0,5). It is defined as follows:
U5MRt ≡

No. deaths to those aged [0,5) in the interval [t,t+5)
.
No. births in the interval [t,t+5)

It is neither a true demographic rate nor a probability but, nevertheless, is in common use.

India
Population Counts

Censuses were conducted in 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001. We used the counts in WPP 2010
which were adjusted for slight undercount in some age groups.

30

B.1.2

Sex Ratio at Birth

Data on sex ratio at birth came from the same sources as data on age-specific fertility
(Section B.1.3). A weighted cubic spline was used to smooth the available data and initial
estimates were derived by evaluating the spline at the mid-points of the quinquennia 1971–
1976, . . . , 1996–2001. Elicited relative error for this parameter was set at 10 percent.
B.1.3

Fertility

Initial estimates of age-specific fertility were based on data from the Indian Sample Registration System (SRS) (The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, 2011) and
National Family Health Surveys (NFHSs) conducted between 1992 and 2006 (The Registrar
General and Census Commissioner of India, 2009). These were weighted and smoothed using
the same procedure as for Thailand. Elicited relative error for this parameter was set at 10
percent.
B.1.4

Mortality

Initial estimates of survival proportions were calculated from abridged life tables based on
data from the SRS from 1968-1969 through 2008. The average number of person-years
lived in each interval (n ax s) were computed using Greville’s (1943) formula from age 15 and
above. Values for ages under 5 are based on the formulae of Coale et al. (1983) using the
West pattern. All other values were set to 2.5 (see also UN, 1982, Ch. 6).
Additional sources were used for infant and child mortality: data on births and deaths
under-five were calculated from maternity-history data from the NFHSs conducted between
1992 and 2006 and data on children ever-born and surviving classified by age of mother from
these surveys and earlier ones as well as from the 2002–04 Reproductive and Child Health
Survey (RCHS). Weighted cubic splines were used to smooth estimates of 1 q0 and 4 q1 from
these data sources. The weights were determined by UN analysts based on their expert
judgement about the relative reliability of each source. Elicited relative error was set to 10
percent.
B.1.5

Migration

We used the same initial estimates for international migration as for Laos.

31

B.2
B.2.1

Thailand
Fertility

Initial estimates of age-specific fertility were based on direct and indirect estimates of current fertility and CEB taken from the Surveys of Population Change conducted between 1964
and 1996 (NSO Thailand, 1970, 1977, 1992, 1997; see also Vallin, 1976), the World Fertility
Surveys (WFSs) (UN, 1993), the Thai Longitudinal Study of Economic, Social and Demographic Change (Knodel and Pitaktepsombati, 1975), the 1968–1972 Longitudinal Study of
Economic, Social and Demographic Change (National Research Council Panel on Thailand,
1980), the 1978 and 1996 National Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (Chamratrithirong et
al., 1997; Suvanajata and Kamnuansilpa, 1979), the 1987 Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS), and vital registration.
Age patterns and levels of fertility were estimated separately from the available data.
The available data were smoothed within age and within year using weighted splines. The
weights were determined by UN analysts based on their expert judgement about the relative reliability of each source. Estimates of TFR, based on summed age-specific estimates,
were obtained similarly. The final set of initial estimates was obtained by multiplying the
smoothed TFRs by the smoothed age patterns. Elicited relative error for this parameter was
set at 10 percent.
B.2.2

Mortality

Initial estimates of mortality for both sexes were based on life tables calculated from vital
registration. Vital registration is thought to have underestimated U5MR (Hill, Vapattanawong, et al., 2007) so the following additional sources were used to derive initial estimates of
under five mortality: (a) the 1974–1976, 1984–86, 1989, 1991, 1995–1996, Surveys of Population Change (NSO Thailand, 1970, 1977, 1992, 1997), (b) maternity-history data from the
1975 WFS and 1987 DHS, (c) data on children ever born and surviving from these surveys,
the 1981–1986 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (CPSs). All available non-census data on
5 q0 from these sources were weighted by UN analysts who used their expert judgement about
potential biases and smoothed over time using cubic splines. The splines were evaluated at
1962.5, 1968.5, . . . 1998.5 and the values substituted for the 5 q0 s in the life tables based solely
on vital registration. Survival proportions were derived from these “spliced” life tables.

B.3

Laos

Initial estimates for females were the same as those used by Wheldon et al. (2013a). Initial
estimates for males were derived using the same procedures.
32

B.3.1

Population Counts

National censuses were conducted in 1985, 1995 and 2005. Following Wheldon et al. (2013a),
we used the census year counts in WPP 2010; there were no post-enumeration surveys, but
these counts were adjusted to compensate for undercount in certain age groups.
B.3.2

Fertility

Direct and indirect estimates were based on CEB and recent births (preceding 12 and 24
months), all by age of mother, collected by the 1993 Laos Social Indicator Survey, the
1995 and 2005 censuses, the 1994 Fertility and Birth Spacing Survey, the 2000 and 2005 Lao
Reproductive Health Surveys, the 1986–1988 multi-round survey and the 2006 MICS3 survey.
Zaba’s (1981) Relational Gompertz Model, Arriaga’s (1983) method, the P/F method (Brass
et al., 1968), Arriaga’s (1983) modified P/F method and the Brass fertility polynomial
(Brass, 1960; Brass and CELADE, 1975) were used to derive indirect estimates.
Age patterns of fertility were estimated by taking medians across all available data points
within the quinquennia 1985–1990, . . . , 2000–2005. TFR was estimated separately by converting each age-specific data series into series of TFR by summing. Medians within quinquennia were then taken. The final initial estimates of the age-specific rates was obtained by
multiplying the median age-patterns by the median TFRs. Data points were not weighted.
The elicited relative error was set to 10 percent. Hence, the medians of the initial estimate
distributions for age-specific fertility rates were the initial point estimates and the upper 95
percent and lower five percent quantiles were equal to the initial point estimates plus and
minus 10 percent, respectively.
B.3.3

Mortality

The available data only provide estimates of mortality under age five. These are maternity
histories and CEB and surviving data from the 1993 Laos Social Indicator Survey, the 1994
Fertility and Birth Spacing Survey, the 1995 and 2000 censuses and the 2000 and 2005
Lao Reproductive Health Surveys (intercensal survival estimates were not used). Weighted
cubic smoothing splines were used to smooth these to produce single initial point estimates
of the average 1 q0 and 5 q0 over each quinquennium 1985–1990, . . . , 2000–2005. For each
quinquennium, two Coale and Demeny West (CD West) life tables were found; one with 1 q0
closest to that produced by the smoothing procedure and one with 5 q0 closest. Within each
pair, the e0 s in these two tables were averaged. Age-specific survival proportions calculated
from the CD West table with e0 closest to this average were then taken as the initial estimates
of mortality at all ages. The elicited relative error of these initial point estimates was set to
10 percent.
33

B.3.4

Migration

There is very little quantitative information about international migration in Laos between
1985 and 2005. To reflect this, initial estimates for females and males were set to zero and
the elicited relative error was high, at 20 percent.

Application: Further Results
India

Results for U5MR are in Figure 8. Posterior medians of Indian U5MR for males are lower
than those for females. However, although the sex ratio in U5MR is centred below one,
the posterior intervals are relatively wide and contain it (mean half-width 0.16 deaths per
live births; Figure 8). The probability that female U5MR exceeded that of males in each
quinquennium is given in Table 7; by the period 1996–2001 this had peaked at 0.89. The
evidence for a linear decrease over the period of reconstruction is weak (Table 8a). There
is a slight decline in the posterior median after 1981 but the evidence for a trend after this
point is similar: the probability of a simple decrease is 0.7 and the probability that the OLS
coefficient was less than zero is 0.68 (Table 8b).

Results for SRU5MR are shown in Figure 10. The posterior suggests mortality at ages 0–
5 was similar for both sexes. The 95 percent credible interval is centred above one for the
period of reconstruction (mean half-width 0.47) and the probabilities that the male-to-female
ratios of U5MR were less than one are small (Table 9). Based on the measures of change over
time used above, there is no evidence for a strong trend in this parameter over the period of
reconstruction (Table 10).

intervals for males fall completely below zero.
Posterior intervals for population sex ratios are in Figure 15. Posterior medians are
