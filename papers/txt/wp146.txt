Abstract
Verbal autopsy (VA) is a widely used survey-based tool for inferring the cause of death
(COD) in regions where deaths are not recorded routinely. InterVA4 is a popular algorithm
for assigning CODs from VA data, but is currently only available to practitioners through
a proprietary software program. The InterVA4 package provides an open-source, R implementation of the InterVA4 algorithm. The package aims to enable more flexible statistical
analyses of verbal autopsy results with simple functions and built-in graphical visualization.
This paper discusses the relevant algorithm, the implementations in R and a discussion of
the InterVA-4 model.

Introduction

Understanding the distribution of deaths by cause is a fundamental dimension of public
health and epidemiological practice and planning. In places without complete registration of
births and deaths, public health experts use a variety of survey-based and partial registration
systems to estimate mortality rates by cause. Verbal autopsy (VA) is one such widely used
survey-based approach. VA involves asking an individual familiar with the circumstances of
a recent death a series of questions about a person’s condition prior to death, then using
this information to draw inference about the causes of deaths (Byass et al., 2012). The
World Health Organization maintains standards for VA and the approach has been widely
used in research units such as the Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) of the
INDEPTH Network (Sankoh and Byass, 2012).
This article introduces a new R package, InterVA4, for performing probabilistic methods
to determine the cause of death from VA data. The work was motivated by the InterVA-4
method and software proposed by Byass et al. (2012), one of the most common analysis tools
for VA data. InterVA-4 is currently implemented only in FoxPro and codes are not readily
available (see www.interva.net for further details). Making InterVA-4 available in an opensource format to the R community will greatly expand the potential for future methodological
and domain research. The package provides output in the same format as InterVA-4 software so the results can be easily integrated into any current data analysis process involving
InterVA-4 software. The package also includes some functionality to graphically display the
distribution of likely causes of death at individual level and a summary of the distribution
at population level.

Verbal autopsy Data

Starting from the 1950s, systematic interviews were conducted by physicians to access causes
of death (Garenne and Fauveau, 2006), and there have been great improvements in the data
capture process (Fottrell and Byass, 2010). VA has been widely used by researchers in Health
and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS), such as the INDEPTH Network (Sankoh and
Byass, 2012) and the ALPHA Network (See http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/eph/dph/research/
alpha/).
A typical VA dataset consists of a series of binary responses to questions about each death.
These questions are typically asked to a relative or other person who is familiar with the
circumstances surrounding the death, but there is typically not a medical professional available to provide an expert opinion about the cause of the death.The indicators are based
on the 2012 WHO VA instrument (see http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/
verbalautopsystandards/), which asks questions related to the deceased individual’s medical condition (did the person have diarrhea, for example) and related to other factors surrounding the death (did the person die in an automobile accident, for example).

Background on InterVA-4 model

InterVA-4 software and the InterVA4 R package infer cause of death form a pre-defined set
of causes, which are compatible with the International Classification of Diseases version 10
(ICD-10). The InterVA4 package replicates the model underlying InterVA-4 as published
by Byass et al. (2012). The core of InterVA-4 model in the package InterVA4 uses Bayes’
theorem to calculate the conditional probability of each particular cause of death given a set
of events. The events in this context are the data obtained from verbal autopsy, including
signs, symptoms and circumstances as listed in the interview questionnaire.
Specifically, with respect to the set of predefined events, data are obtained from verbal
autopsy in the form of a set of binary indicators representing if the event happens or not.
Then the conditional probability for each cause of death could be calculated as:
P (Ci |I) =

P (I|Ci )P (Ci )
P (I|Ci )P (Ci ) + P (I|!Ci )P (!Ci )

(1)

where Ci represents the i-th cause of death and !Ci indicates the compliment of Ci . Thus
over the entire set of possible causes of death, the P (Ci |I) could be normalized in the form:
P (I|Ci )P (Ci )
P (Ci |I) = Pm
k=1 P (I|Ck )P (Ck )

(2)

The InterVA-4 model developed by Byass et al. (2012) provides an initial set of unconditional
probabilities for causes of death C1 . . . Cm , and a matrix of conditional probability P (Ij |Ci )
for indicators I1 . . . In and causes C1 . . . Cm . A repeated application of the calculation for
each I1 . . . In could be formulated as:
P (Ij |Ci )P (Ci |I1...j−1 )
P (Ci |I1...j ) = Pm
k=1 P (Ij |Ck )P (Ck |I1...j−1 )

(3)

The InterVA-4 model loops over all the indicators sequentially and truncates the probability
to 0 if dropping below 0.00001 in the process. In particular, the algorithm considers only
the presence of an indicator. That is, indicators that are not recorded do not factor in to
the probability calculation. The InterVA-4 measure, therefore, is the probability of a given
cause, conditional on only the indicators that are observed, i.e.,

P (Ij |Ci )P (Ci |I1...j−1 )
if Ij = 1
 Pm
k=1 P (Ij |Ck )P (Ck |I1...j−1 )
P (Ci |I1...j ) :=
(4)

P (Ci |I1...j−1 )
if Ij = 0
The conditional probability for two individuals, therefore, will be conditional on a different
number of indicators if the number of indicators reported to have occured in the two deaths
differs. This interpretation typically does not feature prominently in the presentation of
results. Instead, a ranking across probabilities within each individual determines the cause
classification.
One of the major challenges of using this model is building a matrix of conditional probabilities P (Ij |Ci ) covering all causes of death (Byass et al., 2012). The package InterVA4
2

adopted the data, i.e., conditional probabilities and unconditional prior probabilities of the
causes, from the InterVA-4 software which was estimated from a diversity of sources. In particular, the unconditional prior causes incorporates minor changes in response to the level
of HIV/AIDS and malaria, which are specified by the user.
The interVA-4 model further produces a sub-model for women of reproductive age using the
same methodology, which is originally dealt with in the InterVA-M model (Fottrell et al.,
2007; Bell et al., 2008). Three pregnancy statuses are assessed in the model to determine
the likelihood of death being related to pregnancy.
The output of InterVA-4 model is a text file with comma-separated values (CSV) for easy
usage of further study. The output for each death record consists of the following:
1

most likely pregnancy status

likelihood of maternal death

most likely cause
likelihood of 1st cause
second likely cause
likelihood of 2nd cause
third likely cause
likelihood of 3rd cause

In particular, the MALPREV and HIVPREV come from the input of the user. In terms of the
cause of death, the death is considered ‘indeterminate’ if none of the causes has probability
greater than 0.4 and the output INDET has value indet. Otherwise, INDET has value NA and
the most likely cause and its probability are reported. The second and third most likely
causes are only reported if the likelihood is more than half of the most likely cause.

Fitting the InterVA-4 model in R

The InterVA-4 model can be fit with the function InterVA. The function was designed to take
the input of VA data and specified model parameters and output an excel file in .csv format
while saving the results in R as well. The call to InterVA takes the following structure:
> InterVA(Input, HIV, Malaria, directory = NULL, filename = "VA_result",
+ output = "classic", append = FALSE, replicate = FALSE)
Only the Input, HIV and Malaria are required. The rest of the parameters are optional with
default values as above.
Input can be either a matrix of VA data, or directly read from an excel file. It should be in
the form of a data matrix with each row representing a record of VA data. The matrix should
3

have 246 columns, where the first column is the ID of the death record and the rest being
245 binary indicators in the specified order predefined in the InterVA-4 model. A sample
input has been included in the package and can be called by data(SampleInput).
HIV and Malaria are two indicators of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Malaria respectively.
The input could be one of the three levels: "h" (high), "l" (low) or "v" (very low). output
is another indicator with input being either "classic" or "extended". "classic" output
provides the same output as the InterVA-4 software of Byass et al. (2012) and "extented"
further outputs a detailed distribution of probability in each cause of death category in the
columns following the "classic" output.
The input data for InterVA is first checked to ensure that each input record maintains
consistency with the verbal autopsy questionnaire. Contradictory input values are removed
from the output and recorded in the text file errorlog. In particular, two aspects of consistency are checked. First, for each event there are circumstances in which the event is not
possible. For instance, events related to pregnancy cannot happen to males. Therefore we
denote the event “male” as being a “don’t-ask-item” for pregnancy events. Thus for each
event, its corresponding “don’t-ask-item” should be mutually exclusive with the event itself.
Second, there are subsequent questions that will only be asked if certain events happen for
a death. For instance, “fever lasting longer than two weeks” will only be asked if “fever”
happens. In this case, we denote “fever” as the “ask-if-item” for “fever lasting longer than
two weeks”.
The data check step uses the list of the ‘don’t-ask-items’ and ‘ask-if-items’ for each event,
and modifies the input indicators following the rules:
1. If A is the “don’t-ask-item” of B and A is present, we make sure B is absent.
2. If A is the “ask-if-item” of B and B is present, we make sure A is present.
After the data checks, these two rules are followed and all the changes made to the input
data are saved in the warning log in the directory specified in InterVA. Then the calculation
of probabilities is performed as in equation (3).
After fitting the InterVA-4 model, an output CSV document is produced containing all of
the results. A simple graphical representation including bar chart or pie chart can be plotted
with the function InterVA.plot for single case plot and Population.summary for combined
result of multiple cases.

If one wishes to replicate exactly results as InterVA4, a typical VA analysis could be the
following:

+

data(SampleInput)
sample.output<-InterVA(SampleInput, HIV="h",Malaria="l",
directory = "VA test", filename = "VA_result",
output="extended",append=FALSE, replicate = TRUE, groupcode = FALSE)

The filename could be changed to any file name to store the CSV output. The output
option specifies if the detailed distribution will be saved in the output. The groupcode
option specifies whether or not to include the group codes for causes in the output cause
names. It should be set to TRUE if researchers need the group codes provided by InterVA-4
software for aggregation, or to be compatible with existing analysis procedures.
The output saved in R is a list of ID and an object with the length equal to the number
of deaths assessed. In each list, the outputs in the CSV file are stored as well as the entire
probability distribution. For instance, the data from the above example is:
> summary(sample.output)

The InterVA-4 software has been widely used to determine cause-specific mortality fractions. The InterVA4 package also replicates the suggested routine to calculate cause-specific
mortality fractions for a population. It could be easily calculated by:
> csmf<- InterVA.summary(sample.output$VA)
where a vector of length 60, or 61 if there are undetermined cases, will be returned with the
mortality fraction for each of the causes.
The InterVA.plot function is designed to graphically display the InterVA result for individual deaths. A user could choose from bar (bar chart), pie (pie chart) or both for the
parameter type. Also in practise, usually it is only the top few causes with larger probabilities that are of interest. Thus the cut-off line are specified in min.prob. Similarly, if
more deaths are analyzed, the probability distribution can be pooled from all outputs and
displayed in one plot using the function Population.summary. For example, to plot the bar
chart of the COD distribution for the 7-th death in the output:
>InterVA.plot(sample.output$VA[[7]],type="bar",min.prob=0.01,
+ main = "a sample VA analysis using bar chart", cex.main = 0.8)

To be consistent with the original InterVA4 software’s instructions to construct cause-specific
mortality fraction, it could be calculated in the same way as InterVA.summary by setting
InterVA = TRUE, or with customized top k cases by setting option top = k. When either of
top or InterVA is set, the probabilities for the rest of the causes not taken into consideration
are placed into an extra category “Undetermined”. If only the vector of the mortality fraction
distribution is desired, Population.summary can be called with option noplot = TRUE. it is
also worth noting that the top = 3 setting is not identical to the InterVA-4 CSMF since it
counts all top 3 causes for each death, while InterVA-4 software and the InterVA.summary
function calculates only the causes reported and not necessarily all the top 3 ones. For
example the following two mortality fractions could be different:
>
+
>
+

csmf.top3 <- Population.summary(sample.output$VA, top = 3,
noplot = TRUE)
csmf.interVA <- Population.summary(sample.output$VA, InterVA = TRUE,
noplot = TRUE)

Discussion

The InterVA4 package replicates the implementation of InterVA-4 software in R and makes
the output more flexible for further statistical analysis. There are some points to notice in
comparing the package to the original InterVA-4 software. First, R implements rounding
differently from the original software and thus sometimes leads to different result. Such
inconsistencies in rounding have only a limited effect on the final results, usually less than
1% in the calculated likelihood. In our testing data with 10, 074 records, there are only 83
cases where the probability differs and all of them no greater than 1%. Second, when there
is a tie of probability, the order of output is not clear in the original InterVA-4 model. For

example, if two COD both have exactly the same probability of 40%, there is no specific rule
to determine which is the most likely cause and which is the second. The package InterVA4
takes the original order of the COD list as a reference in such cases, though it is sometimes
different from the output of Byass’ InterVA-4 software.
There are also some possible problems and bugs in the InterVA-4 software that were discovered while creating the R version. First, the criteria of dropping out unlikely causes is
suspicious. In the InterVA-4 software, any candidate cause is dropped out if its partial probability, i.e, probability given some of the symptoms, falls below 10−5 . Since the calculation
is carried out in steps, the symptoms are added to the calculation in a predefined order.
We discovered cases where the probability is small at first and then becomes larger later,
especially with CODs that depend largely on those symptoms lower down on the list, for
examples, external causes like assault and traffic accident. For some of such CODs, the probability usually hit the drop-off line early on and was eliminated from calculation. Adding
this dropping-out rule might usually lead to inaccurate calculation of the probability, and
sometimes even gives different final cause assignments. Therefore we choose not to exercise
this step if calling InterVA with optional parameter replicate = FALSE.
There are also some steps not explained clearly in the InterVA-4 software, including undocumented change of index concerning the symptom “skin less”, and COD distribution
randomly not normalized in final output, which we presume are bugs in Byass’ InterVA-4
8

software. Nevertheless to maintain consistency with the original software, the InterVA4
package replicates all the steps in the software. The optional parameter replicate = TRUE
in the main function InterVA serves to indicate everything is calculated exactly as InterVA4, except for the rounding and order issue discussed before. We have tested this on several
data sets and noticed non-trivial differences in the cause-specific mortality fraction between
the replicate and non-replicate versions. Thus we recommend to use the bug-free replicate
= FALSE version where the bugs on skin problem symptoms, normalization of output, as well
as the dropping-out rule are fixed.
