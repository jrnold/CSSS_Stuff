Abstract
To understand policy-motivated behavior of Supreme Court justices it is necessary to
measure their policy preferences. To date, most scholars have assumed the policy preferences
of Supreme Court justices remain consistent throughout the course of their careers, and most
measures of judicial ideology – such as Segal and Cover (1989) scores – are time invariant.
This assumption is facially valid; Supreme Court justices serve with life tenure, and are
typically appointed after serving in other political or judicial roles. However, it also possible
that the world views, and thus policy preferences, of justices evolve through the course of
their careers. In this paper we use a Bayesian dynamic ideal point model to investigate
preference change on the Supreme Court that allows for justices’ ideal points to change over
time in any smooth fashion. We focus our attention on the sixteen justices who served for
ten or more terms and completed their service between 1937 and the present. The results
are striking – fourteen of these sixteen justices exhibit significant preference change.

Introduction

Do the revealed preferences of Supreme Court justices change over time?1 The answer to this
question has broad implications, both for our understanding of the Supreme Court, and the
manner in which scholars measure the ideal points of justices. If the assumption of preference
stability does not hold, then the findings of all studies which rely on constant measures of
preferences may be called into question. But for the study of Epstein et al. (1998) in The
Journal of Politics, no systematic empirical analysis has determined the extent to which
judicial preferences change over time.
In this paper we employ a Bayesian dynamic ideal point model developed by Martin and
Quinn (2002) to estimate revealed preferences for all Supreme Court justices serving between
1937 and 2000. This model allows us to estimate ideal points that are on a comparable metric
over time, and also permits a wide range of smooth dynamics in ideal points. Further, since
these ideal point estimates are based on a statistical measurement model, we can gauge
uncertainty of the estimates and other quantities of interest. We use the results from this
model to demonstrate that the revealed preferences of Supreme Court justices are far from
stable.
We begin this note by reviewing the literature, and arguing that the Epstein et al. (1998)
1

Throughout this note we use the terms preferences and ideal points interchangeably

to mean revealed preferences. That is, the preferences defined in an issue space revealed
through the votes of the justices (Epstein and Mershon, 1996). It is important to note that
this notion of revealed policy preferences is conceptually very different from personal policy
preferences, or attitudes (Segal and Spaeth, 1993). The revealed preferences that we estimate
on a policy scale are likely caused by any number of factors, including personal attitudes, the
decision context, and so forth. The purpose of this paper is to document change in revealed
preferences; we leave explaining change for future research.

study has methodological flaws which limit its ability to uncover preference change. We then
discuss the measurement model we employ, highlighting its ability to estimate preferences
while controlling for changes in case stimuli. In Section 4, we discuss research design, and
present the evidence for preference change. The final section concludes.

A Methodological Critique of the Literature

Personal policy preferences, or attitudes, are key explanatory variables in attitudinal accounts of judicial behavior (Segal and Spaeth, 1993). If the attitudinal model is true, then
the revealed preferences (or ideal points) of the the justices will correspond to their attitudes.
On the other hand, strategic accounts of Supreme Court decision making use preferences
as building blocks for explaining interdependent behavior. Regardless of the theoretical
approach, Epstein et al. (1998) summarize the prevailing wisdom in the study of judicial
behavior: “[t]he occasional anomaly notwithstanding, most jurists evince consistent voting
behavior over the course of their careers” (p. 801).

2.1

The Assumption of Constant Preferences

The attitudinal model (Schubert, 1974; Rohde and Spaeth, 1976; Segal and Spaeth, 1993)
asserts that justices have personal attitudes, and that cases provide stimuli material from
which justices make decisions. The model does not explicitly assume that attitudes are
fixed. However, nearly all empirical work related to the attitudinal model employs constant
measures of attitudes. The most commonly used measures are Segal and Cover (1989) scores,
which are based on newspaper editorials at the time of confirmation. Others use measures
such as the party identification of the justice (George and Epstein, 1992), or measures of social
background (Tate, 1981). In some areas, such as civil rights and civil liberties, these time
invariant measures are shown to be quite successful in explaining votes, but in others, like
economics and federalism cases, their performance is suspect (Epstein and Mershon, 1996).

3

An alternative explanation of behavior – the strategic model (Eskridge, 1991; Epstein and
Knight, 1998) – asserts that justices have policy preferences, and pursue their preferences
in an interdependent choice situation. While, this model does not necessarily assert that
preferences are constant, nearly all empirical work employs measures where this is the case,
most notably Eskridge (1991) and Segal (1997) who use Segal and Cover (1989) scores, and
Spiller and Gely (1992) who use the party of the appointing president.
The key point to take from the literature is that the assumption of constant preferences
in not a theoretical one per se, but rather is chosen for empirical convenience. It is somewhat
surprising, then, that little systematic research has been conducted to determine whether
or not the assumption is consistent with the data. The anecdotal evidence suggests that
preference change sometimes occurs (see, for example Ulmer, 1981; Atkins and Sloope, 1986,
as well as accounts in the law reviews and popular press). And, there is evidence that
justices oftentimes change their behavior between preliminary conference votes and votes
on the merits (Maltzman and Wahlbeck, 1996). This reveals that justices are amenable to
pressure from other justices, and that there are factors besides policy preferences that are
determinants of the vote.
These anecdotal accounts are suggestive, but to draw definite conclusions it is necessary to systematically study the behavior of many justices over time. The first do so was
Baum (1988), who was primarily interested in policy change on the Court. While he claims
there may be some preference change, he concludes that case stimuli, not preference change,
are what explain the observed dynamics. In the only study with the goal of assessing of
preference change, Epstein et al. (1998) look at all sixteen justices who served ten or more
terms and served their entire career between 1937 and 1993. They contend that it is vital to
look at justices who have served for a long period of time, and to only look at justices who
have completed their entire service in the time period (otherwise, one could underestimate
the number of justices who demonstrated significant preference change). To measure prefer4

ences, they contend that votes are the best place to look (Epstein and Mershon, 1996), and
they use the Baum-corrected (1988) percent liberal civil liberties as their measure of policy
preferences. Given this measure, they use linear, quadratic and cubic regression models to
assess significance. They find that seven justices exhibit no significant preference change
(Brennan, Burger, Burton, Harlan, Jackson, Marshall, Stewart), four exhibit linear trends
(Blackmun, Clark, Reed, and White), and five exhibit nonlinear change (Black, Douglas,
Frankfurter, Powell, and Warren). Their conclusion is that preference change is significant,
and that it should be accounted for in future studies. But this study is predicated on the
use of the Baum correction. On face, this seems problematic, as Baum (1988) notes that one
of the three assumptions on which his method is based is: “each justice’s ideal point on the
civil liberties dimension remains constant throughout the justice’s career ” (p. 907, emphasis
added).

2.2

Estimating Ideal Points from Vote Data

To illustrate the Baum correction, and to highlight the fundamental problem of ideal point
estimation, consider the following hypothetical justice. Assume that a Supreme Court justice
is hearing two statutory cases from different states regarding the length of time a prisoner
can be held and questioned before being brought before a magistrate. Further assume that
the federal law states that unless states adopt another “reasonable” standard, prisoners must
be brought before a judge within twenty-four hours of incarceration. But for these state laws
that are being reviewed, the status quo would be determined by the federal prescription of
twenty-four hours. Further suppose that the hypothetical justice has an preferred policy of
forty hours.
The first case comes from Indiana. The state legislature passed a law that mandated a
forty-eight hour waiting period. The Indiana Supreme Court has held that this length of
time is “reasonable” under the federal guidelines. Upon appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court,

5

our hypothetical justice would vote to affirm the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court
because forty-eight hours is closer to her ideal point than the status quo point of twenty-four
hours. The second case comes from Texas, where the Supreme Court of Texas held that a
waiting period of seventy-two hours is “reasonable.” In the second case, our hypothetical
justice would vote to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Texas, because her ideal
point is closer to the federal policy under reversion. On these two cases, our hypothetical
justice voted to affirm one lower court decision, and reverse another.
With the precise information about the ideal point of the justice and the substantive
content of the cases, it is easy to employ the logic of spatial voting to generate predictions
about behavior (Enelow and Hinich, 1984). However, when estimating ideal points from data,
we typically only observe the votes cast by individual justices.2 The fundamental problem of
ideal point estimation is simultaneously estimating these ideal points and the characteristics
of the cases being considered (also know as the case parameters). The manner in which this
problem is resolved statistically is by recognizing that when given a set of case characteristics,
one can recover the set of best-fitting ideal points. And when given a set of ideal points,
one can recover the set of best-fitting case characteristics. These can be done simultaneously
when these two parts are tied together in a statistical model (Clinton et al., 2000; Poole and
Rosenthal, 1997).
In our example, given the case parameters and the two votes on the cases, we can infer
that our hypothetical justice’s ideal point must fall between thirty-six and forty-eight. The
2

In an ideal world we would have specific information about the specific policy under

affirmance of the lower court decision, and about the particular issues being argued on each
case. Having this type of data would provide even better estimates of ideal points. But
collecting such data is extremely cumbersome, and substantively impossible across a large
number of issues.

6

affirmance vote in the Indiana case suggests that our justice has an ideal point greater
than thirty-six, and the Texas case suggests that our justice has an ideal point less than
forty-eight. With a large number of cases, and with some distributional assumptions that
define a metric, a justice’s ideal point can be estimated with great precision. The same logic
holds when trying to uncover the case parameters given the ideal points. What ties the
two parts of the ideal point model together, and thus make it statistically estimable, are
assumptions about the distribution of ideal points and case characteristics to ensure that
both are measured on the same metric. The problem is exacerbated when the analysis is
extended across time, as ideal points can possibly change term-to-term. Yet the solution
remains the same; making reasonable distributional assumptions to tie together the case
parameters and ideal points throughout the course of the study.

2.3

The Baum Correction

The Baum (1988) correction is the tool Epstein et al. (1998) employ to tie together estimates
of ideal points throughout time. To formalize the problem of dynamic ideal point estimation,
let θt,j ∈ R denote the ideal point or policy preference of justice j in term t. Furthermore,
(l)

(r)

let xk ∈ R denote the location of the liberal policy alternative for case k, and xk ∈ R
denote the conservative policy alternative for case k. These two case parameters contain the
information about the policy content of each case. The midpoint between these two policy
(l)

(r)

locations (xk + xk )/2 (also called the indifference point) determines the manner in which
(r)

(l)

the justice votes.3 If, for example, and xk > xk , then those to left of the midpoint will
vote for the liberal option, and those to the right will vote for the conservative one.
Figure 1 contains an illustration of two hypothetical configurations of preferences in terms
3

The midpoint is determinative under the assumption of symmetric utility functions,

such as with the commonly used quadratic utility function (Enelow and Hinich, 1984), or a
Gaussian utility function (Poole and Rosenthal, 1997)
7

t − 1 and t for nine justices. In the top line of the figure in term t − 1 the midpoint falls
between Justice 5 and 6. In the second line, the location of the midpoint has changed,
and now falls between Justice 3 and 4. Notice that in the figure the preferences remain
the same, but the observed vote would change (it would be 5-4 in the first case, and 6-3
in the second). Thus, computing a raw average across a set of cases could be misleading
unless the changes in case stimuli are controlled for. Baum recognizes this fact, and offers a
correction to account for it. In his case, between two natural Courts (or, for Epstein et al.
(1998) between terms), one computes the median change in the percent liberalism for each
justice across all justices (formally, medj {θˆt,j − θˆt−1,j }), where θˆt,j is the estimated ideal
point, in this case computed as the percent liberal in civil liberties cases. This is the Baum
correction to then be subtracted from each justice’s estimated ideal point θˆt,j to control for
changes in case stimuli. The Baum correction thus solves the problem of dynamic ideal point
estimation by assuming that preferences are fixed, and that any dynamics are solely in the
case parameters.
As Baum notes, this correction is only appropriate if preferences are constant. Indeed,
by inspecting Figure 1 it is clear that if preferences were also allowed to move, it would
be impossible to determine whether the derived correction was explained by changes in the
case stimuli or changes in preferences. The two are in fact conflated. Observed changes in
Baum-corrected percent liberalism measures will tell us that something changed (either the
ideal points or the case parameters) but it cannot tell us which changed. Moreover, there
is no justification for using the median change as the correction. Clearly the median justice
does not always prevail on the Supreme Court, as we observe many votes of 6 − 3, 7 − 2, and
so forth. Thus, the results of the Epstein et al. (1998) study are questionable.
There are other limitations which call the Epstein et al. (1998) findings into further question. First, the authors treat their estimates as if they are known with certainty. However,
they are estimates, and should not be used in subsequent models as quantities know with
8

certainty. To test for significant preference change, Epstein et al. (1998) estimate linear,
quadratic, and cubic models of ideal points regressed on time. From these regressions they
draw the conclusions highlighted above. Not only does this assume that the variance regression disturbances are constant (which is unlikely to be the case given the sampling model),
but it also asserts that preference change is a global phenomenon. However, if a justice’s
preferences change for only a subset of terms, the slope estimates will be attenuated toward
zero, and thus biased against finding preference change. In short, even if the Baum correction
was accurate, the Epstein et al. (1998) method of assessing preference change may be overly
liberal by treating ideal point estimates as know quantities, and may be overly conservative
by estimating global models of preference change.

Bayesian Dynamic Ideal Point Estimation

From this review it is clear that the question of whether or not the preferences of Supreme
Court justices change over time is still open. It is also clear that to answer the question one
requires a statistical model that allows for ideal points to exhibit a wide range of dynamics,
based on a fully parameterized statistical model that simultaneously estimates case stimuli
and ideal points. Measures of uncertainty should be reported, and accounted for in diagnosing preference change. Further, tools other than global regression models are needed to
assess the amount and magnitude of preference change.
The model we employ begins with two assumptions. First, that justices vote in accordance
with the spatial model outlined in the previous section. That is, all votes can be explained
solely by considering the ideal points of the justices and the case stimuli. Second, we assume
that a single issue dimension structures all decision making from 1937 to the present.4 With
4

Both of these are strong assumptions, but ones that can be tested with the data. If the

statistical model we propose fits well, then the assumptions are reasonable. Moreover, there

9

these two assumptions, and a further assumption that disturbances to the latent utility
of voting are independent Gaussian random variables, one can show that a standard twoparameter item response model can be used to estimate both case parameters and the ideal
points from voting data (Clinton et al., 2000). This model, which we call a constant ideal
point model, assumes that ideal points are time invariant.
Martin and Quinn (2002) extend this model, and propose a dynamic ideal point model
which allows for preferences to change over time. Conceptually this model estimates all of
the case parameters from a distribution common to all terms, and an ideal point for each
justice in each term on a comparable metric across terms. The model is formalized as follows.
Let Kt ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , K} denote the set of cases heard by the Supreme Court in term t, and
Jk ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , J} denote the set of justices who heard case k. The cardinality of |Jk | denotes
the number of justices sitting on a case k, which is typically nine, but fewer in certain cases.
We are interested in modeling the decisions made in terms t = 1, . . . , T on cases k ∈ Kt by
justices j ∈ Jk in a uni-dimensional issue space. We code all votes in term t on case k by
are handful of reasons to suspect that the judicial policy space from 1937 to 2000 is unidimensional. Using multidimensional scaling techniques, Grofman and Brazill (2002) show
that between 1953 and 1991 a single dimension best explains Supreme Court decision making.
To assess dimensionality throughout the time period of our study, we have computed the
eigenvalues of double-centered agreement matrix for each term. Poole and Rosenthal (1997)
suggest that if number of eigenvalues greater than one are suggestive of the true underlying
dimensionality. For every term, the second eigenvalue is less than one, which suggests a
uni-dimensional model is appropriate (these supplemental results are available in the web
appendix). Moreover, the policy dimension we estimate is highly correlated with the many
(non-orthogonal) scales uncovered by Schubert (1974) and Rohde and Spaeth (1976). This
evidence, along with the model fit discussed below, justifies these simplifying assumptions.

justice j as either being in favor of the conservative option (vt,k,j = 1) or the liberal option
(vt,k,j = 0). The observed data matrix V is thus a (K × J) matrix of votes and missing
values.
The spatial model suggests that the ideal points of the justices θt,j for the j th justice
(l)

(r)

in term t, and the case stimuli xk and xk , determine votes on the merits. These are the
quantities we wish to estimate from the data. To do so, let zt,k,j denote a latent random
utility which explains the votes on the merits:

1 if zt,k,j > 0
vt,k,j =
0 if zt,k,j ≤ 0 ,

(1)

The spatial model suggests that (Clinton et al., 2000; Martin and Quinn, 2002):
zt,k,j = αk + βk θt,j + εt,k,j

(2)

Where εt,k,j is a random error term, which we assume is homoscedastic with known variance.
The two case parameters αk and βk characterize the case stimuli. In fact, the ratio −αk /βk
(l)

(r)

is the estimate of the midpoint between xk and xk . And, the estimate of the ideal point
for justice j in term t is θt,j . This model differs from that standard two-parameter item
response model in that these ideal points are allowed to change over time.
To complete the model it is necessary to assign prior distributions to all parameters. We
begin by assuming standard Gaussian prior distributions for the case parameters:5


αk
∼ N2 (0, I2 ) ∀ k ∈ {1, . . . , K} .
βk

(3)

The Martin and Quinn (2002) model departs from the standard approach in the prior distribution over the ideal points. We assume that the ideal points follow a random walk process.
5

We have relaxed the assumption of standard Normal priors, and assigned prior variances

of 0.5 · I2 , 3 · I2 , and 5 · I2 ; the substantive results remain the same. This suggests that the
data contains a good deal of information about these case parameters. [KQ or ADM –
double check this]
11

This allows for preference change of all sorts. We model these dynamics with a separate
random walk prior for each justice:
θt,j ∼ N (θt−1,j , ∆θt,j ) for t = T j , . . . , T j and justice j on the Court ,

(4)

where T j is the first term justice j served, and T j is the last term j served. We do not
estimate ideal points for terms in which a justice did not serve. ∆θt,j is an evolution variance
parameter which is fixed a priori by the researcher. Its magnitude parameterizes how much
borrowing of strength (or smoothing) takes place from one time period to the next. Note that
if ∆θt,j = 0 this would be the same as assuming fixed ideal points. At the other extreme,
as ∆θt,j → ∞ we get a model in which the ideal points are temporally independent. To
complete the prior, we must anchor each time series at the unobserved time period zero.
Here, in a slight abuse of notation, we let 0 denote time period T j − 1 for all j. We assume
that:
θ0,j ∼ N (m0,j , C0,j ) .

(5)

To estimate this model, we adopt the strategy of Martin and Quinn (2002), which is based
on standard item response theory (Albert, 1992; Bock and Lieberman, 1970; Bradlow et al.,
2000; Hambleton and Swaminathan, 1985) and Bayesian dynamic linear models (West and
Harrison, 1997).
Note that this random walk prior is a solution to the fundamental problem of dynamic
ideal point estimation. It ensures that ideal points and case parameters are measured on the
same metric throughout time. This prior provides the necessary distributional assumption
to keep ideal points on the same metric while also allowing for smooth changes across time.
Before we turn to our specific application, it is important to recognize some additional
properties of this model. First, this is a fully parameterized statistical model, which not only
solves the fundamental problem of ideal point estimation, but allows us to report measures
of uncertainty for all quantities of interest. Second, this approach does not conflate possible
12

changes in case stimuli and idea points. Both are estimated separately in the model: the case
parameters αk and βk are the estimates of the case stimuli, and the θt,j are the ideal point
estimates in each term. Third, this model allows for ideal points to change over time. The
use of the random walk prior allows for change to take an extremely wide range of smooth
forms, and is much more flexible than assuming linear or polynomial change, such as the
D-NOMINATE model of Poole and Rosenthal (1997).

The Evidence for Preference Change, 1937-2000

To make our results comparable to Epstein et al. (1998), and due to data availability, we
focus our attention on the Supreme Court from the 1937 to the 2000 terms. During this
time period, forty-one justices served (J = 41). We obtain data from three sources: (1) data
for the 1953 to 2000 terms comes from the Original United States Supreme Court Database
(Spaeth, 2001a); (2) data for the 1946 to 1952 terms comes from the Vinson-Warren Court
Database (Spaeth, 2001b); (3) data for the 1937 to 1945 terms comes from an unpublished
dataset collected and used by Epstein et al. (1998).6 This selection results in K = 4597 total
cases, the most heard in the 1972 term (108), and the fewest heard in the 2000 term (36).
6

The unit of analysis is the case citation (ANALU=0). We select cases where the type of

decision (DEC TYPE) equals 1 (orally argued cases with signed opinions), 5 (cases with an
equally divided vote), 6 (orally argued per curiam cases), or 7 (judgements of the Court), and
drop all unanimous cases. As discussed by Martin and Quinn (2002), dropping unanimous
cases does not impact estimation of ideal points or case parameters because these cases do
not contribute to the likelihood. For comparability with Epstein et al. (1998) and across the
three data sources, we code all votes as either liberal or conservative. The coding protocol
is arbitrary; one would obtain identical ideal point estimates if all votes were coded affirm
or reverse, minority or majority, etc.

13

To ensure a common scale for the ideal points across time, it is necessary to assign
informative priors for justices that span the entire length of the study. In our case, we set
the prior mean for the ideal points m0,j to zero for all justices except Black, Stewart, and
Rehnquist, with prior means −2.0, 1.0, and 3.0 respectively. The prior variances Cj,0 were
set to one for all justices but for these three. Note that this prior is only on the first term in
which the justice served. For all other terms, the ideal point in the previous term serves as
the prior mean. To complete the prior we set the evolution variance ∆θt,j = 0.1 for all justices
in all terms after their first.7 We simulate from the posterior distribution of this model using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Jackman, 2000; Gill, 2002). These methods allow one to
simulate from a distribution that is otherwise computationally intractable.8 To simulate from
the posterior distribution f (θ, α, β|V) ∝ f (V|θ, α, β)π(θ)π(α, β), we employ the sampler
proposed by Martin and Quinn (2002). Using data augmentation to simulate the latent
utilities, this sampler consists of truncated Normal updates, Normal updates, and updates
from a dynamic linear model (West and Harrison, 1997) for each iteration. With the posterior
density sample in hand, we first performed standard convergence tests. All suggested that
7

Our findings are quite robust to other prior specifications. First, the results are not

substantively different if no informative prior means are used (although reasonable starting
values have to be employed to solve rotational invariance). Second, the results look quite
similar for other evolution variances. We have fit models with ∆θt,j = 0.01, ∆θt,j = 0.25,
∆θt,j = 0.5, and ∆θt,j = 3.0 and find nearly identical results. This implies that regardless of
the amount of smoothing, many justices exhibit preference change.

This application is extremely computationally expensive due to the size of the problem.

the chain has reached the stationary distribution.9 There are many advantages to using
Bayesian methods in the context of ideal point estimation; see Jackman (2001) for a review.
Due to the large number of parameters, maximum likelihood inference for our dynamic ideal
point model would be intractable.
Our main quantity of interest is the ideal points of the justices. Due to space considerations, we only report the ideal point estimates of the sixteen justices Epstein et al. (1998)
considered. These justices are chosen because they served for ten or more terms (thus allowing for the possibility for change), and because they completed their entire terms of service
between the 1937 and 2000 terms inclusive. The ideal point estimates, for each justice in
each term in which they served, are presented in Figure 2. The large point in the middle
is the posterior mean of the ideal points, and the error bars represent plus or minus two
posterior standard deviations. One can think of the posterior mean as a point estimate, and
the posterior standard deviation as a standard error. The amount of uncertainty of the estimates depends primarily on two factors; ceteris paribus more extreme justices are estimated
with less certainty than centrist justices, and terms with more less cases are estimated with
less certainty than those with more cases.
The scale we estimate is a conservatism scale – higher values represent greater conservatism. The results in Figure 2 are striking. Many justices seem to trend over the course
of their careers. Black begins his career as a liberal, but gets more conservative over time.
Frankfurter and Reed also trend towards conservatism; Reed ends his career as a moderate,
while Frankfurter ends his career as a conservative. O Other justices get more liberal over
time. The classic example is Blackmun, a Nixon appointee who was actually quite conservative in his first few terms. Yet at the time of his retirement in the mid-1990s, Blackmun
became quite liberal, and in fact was one of the most liberal justices on the Court. Clark,
9

15

Powell, and Warren also seem to become more liberal over the course of their careers.
Changes in ideal points are not limited to directional trends. Some justices remain
somewhat constant throughout the course of their careers, such as Stewart and White.
Others exhibit more exotic patters. Douglas begins his career as liberal, becomes more
moderate through the late 1940s and early 1950s, and them becomes increasingly more
liberal through the remainder of his career. Harlan too has a parabolic shape, although
although the amount of change is far less dramatic than that of Douglas. White’s trajectory
seems to have two modes; in the early 1970s and the mid 1980s White’s behavior is slightly
more conservative than the surrounding terms. The location of the justices on the scale
comports with our understanding of the Court, and is rather consistent with past measures.
For the 1953-1999 time period these results are almost exactly the same as those by Martin
and Quinn (2002). The only difference in Justice Douglas. Martin and Quinn (2002) fixed
the evolution variance of Douglas to be quite small because of his extremism. The prior
assumed here is much more flexible. While not presented here, our model estimates the
ideal points for all forty-one justices who served between 1937 and 2000. We provide these
estimates as measures of revealed preferences on the web appendix for this note.
How well does the model fit? In short, quite well. In particular, these results correlate
highly with percent liberalism in civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases
(Martin and Quinn, 2002). This is surprising, as most existing measures only fare well for
civil rights and civil liberties cases (Epstein and Mershon, 1996). Additionally, the model
has solid explanatory power. Overall, the model correctly classifies 75.7% of the votes.10
10

These are computed by averaging over the parameter uncertainty of the ideal points

and the case parameters. Compared to other measures of model fit, such as the rank order
measures used by Poole and Rosenthal (1997) or using only the point estimates, this is a
very conservative measure. While this measure of fit can say nothing about external validity,

16

In Figure 3 we plot the term-by-term percent correct classification for our model. The
model performed worst in the 1945 term (68.6% correctly classified), and best in the 1939
term (85.2% correctly classified). There are clearly dynamics in the classification rate, but
compared to a baseline of 50% classification, the model does well. Not surprisingly, the model
appears to do increasingly better in terms with stable membership; the big dips correspond
to the appointment of new justices.
From Figure 2 it appears as if the preferences of Supreme Court justices change a great
deal over time. However, these are quantities that are measured with uncertainty. It is
important to account for that uncertainty when making claims about whether or not there
is significant change in ideal points for individual justices. To assess preference change, it
is also important not to rely on global models of change, such as linear regression models.
In fact, the probability of interest is the posterior probability that a particular justice is
more conservative in subsequent terms than in a baseline term. As Hagle (1993) notes,
justices learn a great deal during their first term of service. Maltzman and Wahlbeck (1996)
also show that justices are amenable to persuasion early in their careers. This implies it is
not a terribly reliable baseline. For our first comparison, we take the mean ideal point of
each justice’s second, third, and fourth terms of service as the baseline for comparison (θj∗ ).
Then, for all subsequent terms, we compute the posterior probability that the justice is more
conservative than the baseline:
1
Pr(θr,j > θj∗ ) for r = 4, ..., T j where θj∗ = (θ2,j + θ2,j + θ3,j ).
3

(6)

Notice that by computing the probabilities in this fashion, we account for all parameter
uncertainty in these estimates. For each of the sixteen justices, we plot these posterior
probabilities in Figure 4. Each cell of the figure contains dotted lines at the 2.5th and the
97.5th percentiles. If the estimated probability is greater than the 97.5th percentile, then
it does show that the assumptions on which this spatial model are based are reasonable.
17

we can conclude that the justice was significantly more conservative in that term. If the
estimated probability is less than the 2.5th percentile, we can conclude that the justice was
significantly more liberal in that term than in the baseline term.
The results in Figure 4 are striking. Justices Black, Douglas, Frankfurter, Harlan, Jackson, Reed, and White are significantly more conservative in some subsequent terms than the
baseline. Justices Blackmum, Brennan, Burger, Clark, Douglas, Harlan, Marshall, Powell,
and Warren are significantly more liberal in some subsequent terms. Justices Douglas and
Harlan are significantly more conservative than the baseline in some subsequent terms and
significantly more liberal than the baseline in other subsequent terms. This is consistent
with the parabolic trajectories in Figure 2. But the patterns are quite different, as Harlan
is only significantly more liberal in his final term than the baseline, while Douglas is significantly more liberal for well over his final decade. Another interesting pattern is White,
who is significantly more conservative than the baseline for two periods. This confirms the
bimodality demonstrated in Figure 2. Only two justices – Burton and Stewart – demonstrate no significant change in their ideal points, even after controlling for changes in case
stimuli.11 The implication is clear – Epstein et al. (1998) underestimate the amount of preference change on the Supreme Court. And, their conclusion that Brennan, Burger, Harlan,
Jackson, and Marshall exhibit no significant change is incorrect. This is likely due to their
measurement strategy, and using only a global test of preference change. Indeed, our results
for Harlan, Douglas, and White show that assuming a particular functional form, either
linear or parabolic, for ideal points trajectories is an inappropriate assumption. The findings
for these justices would be masked (as with Harlan), or attenuated (as with Douglas and
11

The choice of the baseline category is arbitrary. To test for robustness, we have created

these same plots for more or less terms in the baseline, and the results are substantively the
same. These results are available in the web appendix.

White) using a global measure.
Instead of imposing a particular baseline for comparison, we present further evidence of
preference change in Figure 5. To construct this figure, we compute the posterior probability
that a given justice is more conservative in term r than term s for all possible combinations
where r > s. That is:
Pr(θr,j > θs,j ) for s = 1, ..., T j − 1, r = 2, ..., T j , and r > s.

(7)

We summarize these posterior probability profiles for four justices of interest in Figure 5. The
baseline term is on the y-axis, and the comparison term is on the x-axis. For example, if one
is interested in determining whether or not Justice Black is more conservative in subsequent
terms than the 1950 term, one would read across from left to right at the 1950 tick on the
y-axis. The legend shows how the probabilities are encoded in the figure. The bright red
color implies that the justice is significantly more liberal, and the bright blue color implies
that the justice is significantly more conservative. For the sake of space, we only present
these profiles for Justice Black, Harlan, Marshall, and Stewart. The profiles for the other
twelve justices are available in the web appendix.
The results in Figure 5 confirm the conclusions drawn from Figure 4. Compared to his
first terms, Justice Black is significantly more conservative in nearly every subsequent term.
Also, if we chose terms in the mid-1950s as the baseline, we also see that Justice Black
was also significantly more conservative in the late-1960s. Similarly, we see that Justice
Marshall because significantly more liberal throughout the term of his service. But, by the
early 1980s, he remains a stable liberal. Justice Harlan, with the parabolic trajectory, is
another interesting case. The estimated posterior probability profile shows that depending
on the baseline category, Harlan became significantly more conservative or significantly more
liberal. Finally, the cell for Justice Stewart shows no significant preference change regardless
of the baseline. These profiles show that global tests of preference change are inappropriate
19

– rather, one should use local estimates of the probabilities of interest as we have done here.
The findings from these results are striking – preference change is a common phenomenon
that occurs quite often on the Supreme Court.

Implications and Conclusion

These results call into question the assumption that the preferences of Supreme Court justices
remain constant throughout the course of their careers. This is important to two crucial
respects. First, if other scholars employ preference measures that are constant across time,
such as Segal and Cover (1989) scores, the independent variable capturing preferences will be
measured with systematic error. It is well know that this can lead to bias in the estimation
of structural parameters of interest, and can lead to incorrect conclusions about the area of
interest. In principle, this bias can not only lead to coefficients that are attenuated toward
zero, but can also cause changes in the signs of coefficients. Practically, when analyzing a
single cross section of data, this measurement error will be of little consequence. But when
studying Supreme Court behavior over time, using time invariant preference measures can
lead to incorrect conclusions about the effect of preferences or other variables on the outcome
of interest. Most statistical studies of judicial behavior look at behavior over time (e.g.
Maltzman and Wahlbeck, 1996; Segal and Cover, 1989), which implies that this is a serious
concern.
Second, the most commonly used measure of judicial preferences, Segal and Cover (1989)
scores, are time invariant. These measure have the advantage of being truly exogenous
from behavior, but the results presented here demonstrate that the assumption of constancy
is inappropriate. Epstein and Mershon (1996) demonstrate that the explanatory power of
Segal and Cover (1989) scores is limited to civil rights and liberties issues, and that the scores
should only be used to study aggregated votes for those issue areas. Or results go a step
further; Segal and Cover (1989) should not be used to study judicial behavior that occurs
20

over time. Other measures, such as party identification of the justices or social background
characteristics suffer the same ills.
What is the solution to this problem? One important by-product of our research is that
we estimate an ideal point for every justice in every term for all justices serving between
1937 and 2000. These measures are available in electronic form on the web appendix. Our
measures are time-varying, and thus do not suffer from the deficiency of other commonly used
measures. When studying any phenomenon expect votes on the merits, these measures can
be employed as independent variables to explain behavior. However, our measures cannot
directly be used to study votes on the merits, because votes were used to construct the
measures. There is a solution to this problem. As Martin and Quinn (2002) discussion, if
one is interested in explaining votes on the merits as a function of ideal points and other
explanatory variables, Equation 2 can be modified by adding a vector of covariates xk to the
equation and simultaneously estimating the parameters of interest γ:
0

zt,k,j = αk + βk θt,j + xk γ + εt,k,j

(8)

This model has the property that if it is correctly specified (which is an assumption implicitly
made about every statistical model), then one can simultaneously estimate structural parameters and ideal points, thus avoiding the endogeneity problem. The estimated γ parameters
are simply probit coefficients, and the recovered θt,j parameters are the ideal points for each
justice. This model can also be estimated using MCMC methods (Martin and Quinn, 2002).
One important question that we leave for future research is what explains preference
change? The results clearly show that justices exhibit change in revealed preferences over
time. Yet, to our knowledge, there exists no literature that theoretically addresses ideal point
change among Supreme Court justices. There are many promising avenues for theorizing.
One literature to consider is the social-psychological literature on attitude change (Eagly
and Chaiken, 1993), which might provide some leverage on the problem. Some of the first
21

term effects documented by Hagle (1993) might be due to some of these factors. We know a
great deal about the social background of the justices (Tate, 1981), and some of these variables might capture some of these psychological phenomenon. This approach dovetails very
nicely with the behavioral theories of judicial behavior Rohde and Spaeth (1976); Schubert
(1974). It also might be the case that strategic considerations are what explain preference
change (Epstein and Knight, 1998). The logic is simple. In some circumstances, such as
with a conservative President and liberal Congress, the Supreme Court is unconstrained,
and can thus sincerely write their policy preferences into law. In other circumstances, such
as a conservative Court facing a liberal executive and legislative branch, the Court will be
constrained, and thus create policy more moderate than they would otherwise (Eskridge,
1991; Segal, 1997). This strategic behavior will manifest itself in case parameters and ideal
points. But inter-institutional politics are not the only locus for strategic behavior; considering intra-institutional politics might also be fruitful (Maltzman and Wahlbeck, 1996).
Finally, the macro-political context might contribute to preference change. To pursue this
line of inquiry, it is necessary to synthesize these theories, develop measures to sort out these
competing explanations, and specify additional statistical models.
At the end of the day, this note contributes to the judicial politics literature in a number of
ways. The dynamic ideal point model an extremely flexible model with respect to ideal point
dynamics. By minimal structure on the trajectory of ideal points, the data demonstrates
that nearly every justice exhibits statistically significant preference change over the course
of their careers. The patterns uncovered by the model are substantively interesting, and
facially valid. Moreover, this simple uni-dimensional model accounts for a great deal of
the variance in votes on the merits over a long time period. We also provide a measure of
revealed preferences that other scholars can use in their research. Yet, the case is not closed
on the phenomenon of preference change among Supreme Court justices; more theoretical
and empirical work needs to take place to explain this empirical regularity.
